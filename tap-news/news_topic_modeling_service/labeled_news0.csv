6,Obama warned Trump about hiring Flynn,"Washington (CNN) Then-President Barack Obama warned President-elect Donald Trump in November against hiring retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as his national security adviser , former Obama administration officials confirmed to CNN Monday.

Obama warned Trump about Flynn during their Oval Office meeting on November 10, days after Trump was elected president.

Obama's concerns, which he relayed to Trump, were not related to the firing of Flynn from the Defense Intelligence Agency but rather in the course of the investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election.

""Flynn's name kept popping up,"" according to a senior Obama administration source.

The White House confirmed later Monday that Obama raised concerns about Flynn during his Oval Office sitdown with Trump in November.

""It's true President Obama made it known he wasn't exactly a fan of Gen. Flynn's,"" press secretary Sean Spicer said.

He said the concerns shouldn't have come as a surprise, since Flynn was an ""outspoken critic"" of the Obama administration's shortcomings on foreign policy.

Spicer said if the Obama administration was ""truly concerned"" about Flynn, there are steps it could have taken, including suspending his security clearance.

Flynn previously served as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama until he was reportedly forced out of the post 2014 over internal disagreements over policy and management.

Trump did not heed Obama's counsel on Flynn, bringing aboard the former military intelligence officer who supported Trump during his campaign as his national security adviser. Trump fired Flynn 24 days later when news broke of Flynn's conversations with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.

News of the warning comes as former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is set to testify before Congress on Monday about the concerns she expressed to Trump administration officials about Flynn's contacts with Russian officials, namely with Kislyak.

NBC News was the first to report the warning.

Yates, in her role as acting attorney general, warned White House counsel Don McGahn on January 26 that Flynn was lying when he denied -- both publicly and privately -- that he discussed US sanctions on Russia with Kislyak. It wasn't until weeks later that Trump asked for Flynn's resignation, only after news surfaced that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak.

According to five current and former intelligence officials, their concern started around the time Flynn went to Moscow for the 10th anniversary gala of the state-sponsored news agency Russia Today. At that dinner, the former high-ranking intelligence official was seated right next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also had contact with Kislyak after the trip.

Former US officials were highly suspicious of Kislyak and his motives, and there were concerns Flynn didn't seem to understand the dangers in the conversations, the officials said. As was reported over the weekend, even Trump's own team was concerned enough to request a CIA profile of the Russian ambassador to help illustrate to Flynn he was taking a big chance in his interactions with Kislyak.

Yates' testimony on Monday will be the first time she speaks publicly about her warnings to the White House about Flynn.

The Senate and House intelligence committees are continuing to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, including potential coordination between Russian officials and the Trump campaign or people close to the campaign.

Congressional investigators have so far homed in on Flynn, Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, and Roger Stone, who informally advised Trump during his presidential run.

While Trump asked for Flynn's resignation, he has not abandoned his former national security adviser altogether.

Trump on Monday morning sought to get ahead of Yates' testimony, taking to Twitter to deflect criticism that he or his administration should have kept Flynn out of the top national security post from the outset.

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama administration -- but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,"" Trump said in his first missive.

""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel,"" he tweeted.

Flynn began advising Trump on national security in early 2016 and soon became a constant presence by Trump's side as he crisscrossed the country from rally to rally.

He frequently introduced Trump on the campaign trail, delivering introductory remarks rife with criticism of the Obama administration's foreign policy and of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Flynn often led Trump supporters in chants of ""Lock her up!"" as he accused her of corruption and negligence in her use of a private email server.

6,Why Trump didn't listen to all the people who told him to stay away from Michael Flynn,"Washington (CNN) Two days after Donald Trump won the presidency, he came to visit the man he would replace at the White House. And, in that meeting, Barack Obama warned Trump about bringing Michael Flynn into his administration due to concerns about the retired general's ties to Russia.

Trump did it anyway -- offering Flynn a job as national security adviser just eight days after meeting with Obama

The question now is why. Why, after being told by the outgoing president that Flynn was bad news -- in the sense that his name was all over the ongoing Justice Department investigation into Russia's attempts to hack the 2016 election -- did Trump ignore that advice within a week? And why has Trump continued to publicly defend Flynn in the face of repeated warnings -- from then Acting Attorney General Sally Yates among others -- that his ties to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak represented a major problem?

I put that question to several current and former Trump officials.

""I wish I knew,"" responded one. The others chose not to respond at all. Which is telling. (Or maybe they are just extremely busy!)

So what could explain Trump's unwillingness to listen to Obama -- and others -- about Flynn? Here are a few theories:

1. Dislike of Obama

JUST WATCHED Spicer: It's true, Obama wasn't a fan of Flynn Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Spicer: It's true, Obama wasn't a fan of Flynn 00:51

White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested Monday that while Obama did tell Trump about his concerns, it was seen through the lens of Flynn's active role as a Trump surrogate and critic of Obama. ""President Obama made it known that he wasn't a fan of General Flynn,"" Spicer said Monday. He added that if Obama felt so strongly about Flynn then his administration should not have approved his security clearance in April 2016.

There's no question that Trump, for all his insistence of how great he and Obama got along in their Nov. 10 meeting, viewed his election as a rejection of Obama's eight years in office. Taking Obama's advice on who to pick as one of his closest advisers would not be the sort of thing Trump would do.

2. Loyalty

Trump prizes loyalty above all else. And no one was more loyal to him than Flynn. Not only was Flynn an early endorser of Trump, he was one of his most aggressive and effective surrogates. By the end of the campaign, Flynn was Trump's de facto hype man/lead introducer at rallies.

Trump doesn't forget that sort of loyalty. And he wants to reward it.

3. Trusts his own judgment

Trump, as businessman and now a politician, believes that his gut is, in every situation, right. The campaign he ran, to his mind, was an affirmation of his gut being smarter and better than all of the advice the so-called professionals were offering. After all, they said he had no chance to win!

Given that, why listen to all the voices telling him to get as far away from Flynn as possible? Why not, on the other hand, embrace Flynn as a symbol of the very outsider movement that elected him in the first place?

While it's not clear exactly what motivated Trump to ignore all sorts of advice -- from President Obama on down -- about Flynn, it's very likely we won't ever know the real reason. Trump is not one to admit mistakes or explain himself. And he -- and his White House -- appear to be bunkered in when it comes to Flynn.",cnn
6,Sally Yates is about to bring back the Russia story in a big way,"Washington (CNN) Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates will testify in front of a Senate subcommittee Monday about what and when she told the Trump White House in regard to Michael Flynn's ties to Russia.

Yates' testimony will push the story of the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia back into the headlines, especially, if expected, she asserts that she warned Trump campaign officials that Flynn, the now-deposed national security adviser, was not telling the full truth about his contacts with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.

Both White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and press secretary Sean Spicer have asserted that Yates passed along information about which the White House counsel checked out and found nothing

President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that the Russia investigations on Capitol Hill -- and the idea that senior members of his campaign were closely involved with Russian intelligence officials -- are ""fake news,"" a theme he kept up on Twitter Sunday.

When will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia & why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?

He made a similar point on Monday, accusing the Obama administration of not properly vetting Flynn when he led the Defense Intelligence Agency during his predecessor's term: ""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.""

He quickly added: ""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. (counsel).""

The problem for Trump is that there is a whole lot of smoke already surrounding his campaign and its ties to Russia -- with Flynn at the center of it all. Flynn was forced to resign after lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak, but since that time, we've learned he reportedly didn't properly report a speech he gave to a RT-TV, a Russia propaganda arm, and that he was paid at least $500,000 to represent Turkey's interests during the 2016 campaign. Late last week, The Washington Post reported that Flynn has been warned by Trump transition officials about the danger of speaking with Kislyak -- a detail CNN has now confirmed

Polling suggests there is significant suspicion regarding the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. In an April Washington Post-ABC News poll, 56% of those tested said that Russia tried to influence the election. Of that group the bulk -- 39% -- said the Trump campaign ""intentionally"" helped Russia's meddling.

The CIA and FBI have confirmed their belief that Russia sought to meddle in the election and that the country's interference was aimed at trying to keep Hillary Clinton from winning. There's no evidence yet that there was any sort of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.

The re-emergence of the Russia investigation comes after, arguably, one of the better weeks of the Trump presidency -- capped by the House's passage of the American Health Care Act on Thursday.

Depending on what Yates says -- and how the White House reacts -- any momentum built from last week (and I am somewhat skeptical there was much) could disappear into thin air. Regardless, Yates' testimony -- and the latest news about Flynn -- is a reminder that the Russia story just isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

Trump and his administration are clearly frustrated by the Russia drumbeat. But their dismissive approach could well come back to bite them in regards Flynn this week and potentially in the future.

Whether this President likes it or not, the Russia story isn't going away anytime soon. Given that, he and his senior team have to figure out a better message than they've had to date.",cnn
16,Kushner family apologizes for mentioning White House adviser Jared Kushner,"A company owned by Jared Kushner's family is apologizing for mentioning the White House adviser at an investment conference in China.

Kushner Companies said Monday that the name drop at the event in Beijing on Saturday was not intended to be an ""attempt to lure investors"" to one of its projects in New Jersey.

Nicole Kushner Meyer, the sister of White House adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, mentioned her brother's new role in the administration during a pitch for her family's property. The New Jersey building makes use of an EB-5 visa program to draw in international investors, including the Chinese.

""In 2008, my brother Jared Kushner joined the family company as CEO, and recently moved to Washington to join the administration,"" she said at the conference.

A similar conference was held in Shanghai on Sunday.

On Monday, Kushner Companies said it didn't mean for the comment to be interpreted as an incentive for investors to sign onto the project.

""Ms. Meyer wanted to make clear that her brother had stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project,"" the company said in a statement.

Related: 'Invest $500,000 and immigrate' to United States

The EB-5 visa allows immigrants a path to a green card if they invest more than $500,000 in a project that creates jobs in the United States. Kushner Companies says about 15% of its New Jersey building -- a $976.4 million residential and commercial project called 1 Journal Square -- will be funded through the EB-5 program.

The program is used by foreigners, particularly wealthy Chinese nationals, as a way into the United States. Lawmakers have criticized it as a way to essentially sell citizenship to the ultra rich.

While Nicole Kushner Meyer didn't reference President Trump by name, his photo appeared on a slide at the event that listed the ""key decision makers"" on the EB-5 program.

Kushner Companies later distanced itself from the photo. In a statement to CNNMoney on Monday, the company said the image ""was part of a presentation by the event's organizers.""

""Kushner Companies had nothing to do with it,"" it added.

Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit watchdog group, said he was skeptical of that explanation.

""You would think if they are going to take part in a marketing event for one of their properties, that they would want to see the PowerPoint,"" he said.

And even if the slide caught Kushner Meyer by surprise, Noble said the incident demonstrates why such connections can be dangerous. The company's foreign partners would understandably jump at the chance to push any perceived connections to the White House.

""They put themselves in a position where obviously people are going to be touting their connections,"" Noble said.

President Trump has made visa reform a central piece of its promised changes to immigration policy.

The White House said Monday that it is ""evaluating wholesale reform"" of the program along with Congress to ensure it is ""used as intended and that investment is being spread to all areas of the country.""

It added that the administration is ""exploring the possibility of raising the price of the visa to further bring the program in line with its intent.""

Related: Why wealthy Chinese are lining up to pay $500k for U.S. visas

Jared Kushner has stepped away from the business since taking a key role in Trump's White House.

His attorney, Blake Roberts, said Saturday that Kushner is not involved in the operation of Kushner Companies and divested his interests in the Journal Square project by selling them to a family trust that he, his wife and his children are not beneficiaries of, which was suggested by the Office of Government Ethics.

""As previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the EB-5 visa program,"" Roberts said in a statement.

Noble, the ethics attorney, said it's unlikely that Nicole Kushner Meyer violated any laws. In Jared Kushner's case, Noble said it depends on what he has divested and whether he follows through with the promise to not participate in EB-5 matters.

6,Pruitt removes scientists from key EPA board,"Story highlights An EPA spokesman disputed that anyone was dismissed

The EPA relies on independent science advisory committees to inform many of their decisions

Washington (CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency dismissed half the scientists who serve on a science review board that plays a crucial role in the work the EPA does, CNN has learned Monday.

The EPA relies heavily on the scientific guidance of the group when it comes to air and water quality when making policy decisions. An EPA spokesman told CNN there are a total of 18 positions on this particular advisory board, and nine of those scientists were not renewed following the end of their three-year term.

There is a notable ideological shift at the agency under the Trump administration and EPA head Scott Pruitt. Some in the scientific community say the dismissal of such a large number of scientists from the EPA's Board of Scientific Counselors is further evidence of that.

Gretchen Goldman, research director at the Center for Science and Democracy asked, ""What's the scientific reason for removing these individuals from this EPA science review board? It is rare to see such a large scale dismissal even in a presidential transition.""

She added, ""The EPA is treating this scientific advisory board like its members are political appointees when these committees are not political positions. The individuals on these boards are appointed based on scientific expertise not politics. This move by the EPA is inserting politics into science. ""

6,Trump singles out historically black college funds in signing statement,"Story highlights Trump signed the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill Friday

Signing statements are often used to flag provisions an administration might disregard

Washington (CNN) The White House pushed back Sunday on questions about a signing statement President Donald Trump added to the latest government spending bill Friday that said his administration would treat minority spending programs -- including one to help historically black colleges pay for construction -- in a manner consistent with the Constitution.

The signing statement ""simply indicates that the President will interpret those provisions consistent with the Constitution"" and is not dissimilar to signing statements issued by past presidents, a White House official said Sunday.

""The important thing to realize is: The President was able to secure big wins for his top priorities in this spending bill, including more than $25 billion in additional funding for the military, $1.52 billion for border security, a permanent extension of health coverage for retired miners, and a three-year extension of the DC school choice program,"" the official said.

Trump signed the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill Friday, adding the statement: ""My administration shall treat provisions that allocate benefits on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender ... in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the laws under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment.""

Those programs included historically black college financing, Native American housing block grants and minority business development, the statement said.

16,Life expectancy differs by 20 years between some US counties,"(CNN) Life expectancy at birth differs by as much as 20 years between the lowest and highest United States counties, according to new research published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine.

Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, lead author of the study and director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, estimated life expectancy for each US county from 1980 through 2014. Murray and his colleagues analyzed county-level data and then applied a mathematical model to estimate the average length of lives.

Life expectancy at birth increased by 5.3 years for both men and women -- from 73.8 years to 79.1 years -- between 1980 and 2014, Murray and his colleagues wrote. During that time period, men gained 6.7 years, from 70 years on average to 76.7 years, while women gained four years, from 77.5 years to 81.5 years.

But the numbers aren't the same everywhere. Looking at the finer details, Murray and his colleagues calculated a gap of 20.1 years between US counties with the lowest and highest life expectancies.

The counties with lowest life expectancy are located in South and North Dakota, while counties along the lower half of Mississippi, in eastern Kentucky, and southwestern West Virginia also showed lower life expectancies compared to the rest of the nation. The North and South Dakota counties include Native American reservations.

At the other extreme, residents of counties in central Colorado can expect to live longest, Murray and his colleagues said.

'Drastically different life expectancies'

While the study does not directly answer why we see low or high life expectancies in specific counties, it does look at what factors contribute to the overall gap between some counties, said Murray.

""We can see that many of the counties with very low life expectancies in the Dakotas, like Oglala Lakota County in South Dakota, overlap with large Native American reservations including the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations,"" said Murray.

Conversely, Summit County, Colorado, ranked as the county with highest life expectancy in 2014 at 86.8 years, is home to several ski resort towns.

""For both of these geographies, the drastically different life expectancies are likely the result of a combination of risk factors, socioeconomics, and access and quality of health care in those areas,"" said Murray.

Yet, socioeconomic factors are not everything, said Murray, explaining that ""60% of the differences in life expectancy across counties can be explained by socioeconomic factors alone"" yet that leaves a ""substantial amount of unexplained differences.""

""Behaviors like smoking and physical activity, along with risk factors like obesity and diabetes, are also very important,"" he said.

Still, almost all counties throughout the nation showed improvement over time, though the number of additional years varied across the nation. Counties in central Colorado, Alaska and along both coasts experienced larger increases than most other counties. Meanwhile some southern counties in states from Oklahoma to West Virginia experienced either no improvement or very little over time.

The most positive note is that, over the study period, all counties show declines in the risk of early death for children under the age of 5 years old, say the authors. And, nearly all counties (about 98%) show declines in the risk of early death for people between the ages of 5 and 25, as well as those between 45 and 85.

However, people between the ages of 25 and 45 show an increased risk of death in 11.5% of counties over the study period.

The study didn't evaluate what might drive changes in mortality risks for specific age groups, Murray said, but he speculates that the same general factors that impact life expectancy overall may drive differences for those ages 25 to 45.

What causes differences in life expectancy? The reasons for life span inequality have been explored in previous studies so the current study examined the extent to which just three factors contributed to lower or higher survival. The three factors are socioeconomic levels and race/ethnicity, behavioral and metabolic risk, and health care.

""Risk factors -- obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes -- explained 74% of the variation in longevity,"" said Murray. ""Socioeconomic factors, a combination of poverty, income, education, unemployment, and race, were independently related to 60% of the inequality, and access to and quality of health care explained 27%.""

The authors used new methodologies that are more precise than past models, but county level data are all subject to error, the authors note. If recent trends are allowed to continue, the differences in life expectancy across counties will increase, not decrease, the researchers add.

'A gap of 20 years ... is absurd'

For the first time since 1993, US life expectancy in 2015 dropped significantly for the entire population, not just certain groups, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in late 2016 . CDC researchers warned that a one-year shift does not mark a trend.

Ellen Meara, a professor or health economist at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, said many factors impact life expectancy. She was not involved in the new research.

""Socioeconomic factors like education and poverty can shorten lives of individuals, and it may be bad to live in areas with high rates of poverty and less educated adults,"" said Meara. ""Similarly, sedentary lifestyles (which are reflected in obesity rates) and smoking are two of the biggest individual risks of poor health and premature death. For people who develop a disease like diabetes or hypertension, also measured in the study at the county level, risk of death is higher.""

Meara noted that the authors used ""rigorous methods"" to gain a more ""comprehensive look"" at deaths by county and age group. ""This research echoes what we have been learning from studies in other settings over the past decade,"" she said. ""Disparities in mortality have widened over time.""

Still, understanding differences across geographic areas can provide clues, said Meara, about what might contribute to improvements over time.

3,Emmanuel Macron: Tough task ahead after victory in France,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Macron (centre left) on his first duty as president-elect, with President François Hollande

Emmanuel Macron took his first steps as France's president-elect on Monday but faces a tough task establishing a team that can govern effectively.

His party has announced it is changing name from En Marche to La Republique En Marche (Republic on the Move).

It must pick candidates quickly ahead of parliamentary elections on 11 and 18 June. It wants to be the biggest party but at the moment has no seats at all.

Mr Macron beat the far right's Marine Le Pen by 66.1% to 33.9% on Sunday.

But a low turnout and a record number of spoiled or blank votes showed disillusionment among many, particularly on the far left, at the choice they were given.

Read more:

Ms Le Pen has also signalled there will be a change to her National Front party. There are suggestions from its officials, too, that it will change its name. But she has vowed to lead the ""new force"" into the parliamentary elections.

First day as president-elect, by the BBC's James Reynolds, Paris

Image copyright AFP

Emmanuel Macron inherits one of the most powerful positions in Europe, and all the symbolism that comes with it.

This morning at the Arc de Triomphe, he showed no sign of being awed by his new job.

He walked alongside the outgoing President, François Hollande, as the two laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

They then shook hands with veterans. Mr Macron appeared to take longer to make his way through one receiving line, stopping to talk to elderly men, leaving Mr Hollande to wait for him at the end.

Emmanuel Macron now becomes France's youngest leader since Napoleon Bonaparte, whose battles are commemorated at the Arc de Triomphe. The new president will hope that his own fights are less bloody.

How difficult could it be for Mr Macron to govern?

He faces two main problems - a complete lack of representation in parliament and a deeply divided country.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption French election night in 120 seconds (including the accidental broadcast of the new president's speech preparations)

Apart from being, at 39, the country's youngest president, he is also the first from outside the two main parties since the founding of the modern republic in 1958.

Although he won support, sometimes grudgingly, from the established Socialists and Republicans, much of it stemmed from the need to beat Ms Le Pen. The conservative Republicans in particular will be looking for a strong showing in the parliamentary polls.

How to do the opinion polls stack up?

Polls released shortly after Mr Macron's victory suggested he and his allies in the centrist Modem party would come out top in the first round on 11 June, with 24%-26% of the vote.

Both the Republicans and National Front would have about 22%, the far-left France Unbowed 13%-15% and the Socialists, still smarting from François Hollande's unpopularity, 9%.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Emmanuel Macron's unconventional route to political stardom in France

But the first-past-the-post system means it is difficult to gauge seat numbers. The National Front only has two seats and despite its candidate's performance in the presidential election, one poll suggested it might only get 15-25 in the 577 seat parliament.

Such uncertainty means Mr Macron might well be faced with a serious amount of horse trading to find allies to buy into his manifesto.

Another opinion poll in Le Figaro on Monday suggested many French people think this no bad thing.

The Kantar Sofres-OnePoint study suggested only 34% of those interviewed hoped the new head of state would have a majority in parliament.

The BBC's Lucy Williamson says Mr Macron's experience as economy minister has taught him that building cross-party consensus for each individual issue can be draining and dispiriting. Much will depend on whether his party can form a stable coalition.

Why the party name change?

It is part of the move to widen support, party secretary general Richard Ferrand said, adding that Mr Macron had now stepped down as party leader given his accession to the presidency.

Mr Macron intends to field candidates in all seats and has said half of them will be newcomers to politics - to try to introduce new blood. Half will be from Modem or defectors from other parties.

The idea is that the candidates will not have to give up their party affiliations but will need to run under the Republique En Marche banner.

6,Immigration: Tories to keep 'tens of thousands' target,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: We still want to cut net migration to 'tens of thousands'

Theresa May has indicated that the Conservatives will again promise to cut net migration to the ""tens of thousands"" in their election manifesto.

Speaking in Harrow, she said migration levels were having an impact on public services and low-paid workers.

Asked if this meant the target - missed repeatedly since 2010 - could be hit, she said it was important to continue to aim for ""sustainable"" levels.

Other parties said the target was ""artificial"" and should be dropped.

On Sunday, Home Secretary Amber Rudd refused to say whether the pledge - which was in the 2010 and 2015 Tory manifestos - would be repeated but the BBC understands it will definitely be in the 2017 manifesto, due to be published next week.

Net migration is the difference between the numbers of people moving to the UK for more than a year, and the numbers of people leaving the UK to live elsewhere for a year or more. The most recent figure was 273,000 and the last year that it was below 100,000 was 1997.

Questions had been raised about whether the target would be retained after Culture Secretary Karen Bradley recently said that immigration was ""not about putting numbers on it"" but about ensuring Britain had the skilled workers it needed.

Analysis

By political editor Laura Kuenssberg

While Theresa May has recommitted to the target that she, as home secretary, missed for six years in a row, ministers have been busy reassuring businesses they will be able to get the people they need, whether builders, bankers, or fruit pickers. If the economy needs them, they will be allowed to come.

That doesn't sound like a recipe for getting the numbers down to Theresa May's preferred level. And even though we are on our way out of the EU, there is still huge scepticism over whether the target is remotely achievable. So why keep it?

Read more from Laura

Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics on Sunday that while she believed immigration should be lower, the party had a ""lot to think through"" and the manifesto would not be ""identical"" to previous ones.

But on a campaign visit in north-west London, Mrs May indicated there would be no back-tracking from the target. Net migration numbers, she said, had gone up and down over the past few years but the commitment still stood.

""I think that it is important that we do say and continue to say that we do want to bring migration to sustainable levels. We believe that is the tens of thousands.""

She added: ""Once we leave the EU, we will of course have the opportunity to ensure we have control of our borders. We will be able to establish our rules for people coming from the EU. That is a part of the picture we have not been able to control before.""

EU migrants accounted for about 44% of the 596,000 people who came to the UK in the year to last September,

Of these, an estimated 294,000 came to work, 134,000 were long-term students, 74,000 came to join existing family members while 61,000 came for other reasons - including asylum seekers and those receiving medical treatment.

Before the Brexit vote, the Conservatives sought to reduce the ""pull factors"" which it said were attracting EU migrants, such as access to benefits. Now they have promised new migration controls once freedom of movement no longer applies, but they have yet to set out the precise model they would adopt.

Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva, from Oxford University's Migration Observatory, said he expected the target to apply to a longer period than five years and possibly exclude certain groups.

""The key question is to what point this is going to be a flexible target... and react to the economy and new developments in the country,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today.

Image caption There have been calls for students to be taken out of the migration statistics

""The previous one was fixed. It did not change over five years. Maybe this one will be adjusted along the way.""

But he said ministers would still face the challenge of reducing levels of migration from outside the EU. Although figures are currently at a three year low and well down on 2010, they remain above the 250,000 mark. Students currently account for about 70% of the total.

Labour says it accepts that the principle of the free movement of people - which EU leaders say goes hand-in-hand with single market membership - would have to end after Brexit but that new immigration controls should not be the ""overarching priority"" as the UK leaves.

Jeremy Corbyn said migrants working in the UK's public services made a ""massive contribution"" and changes to the system resulting from Brexit had to be fair.

""Theresa May made that promise in 2010 and made the same promise in 2015, and didn't get anywhere near it on any occasion at all,"" he said.

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the target was a product of political manoeuvring and ""meant very little"" while Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said it had helped ""split up families and encouraged hostility towards migrants"".

UKIP said the target was ""vacuous"" and the Conservatives had broken their promises ""time and time again"" on the issue.

Announcing its own proposals, including a five-year ban on unskilled and low-skilled foreign labour, it said its ambition to reduce net migration to zero would put ""clear water"" between itself and the other parties.

3,Obama warned Trump about hiring Michael Flynn,"Image copyright Getty Images

Barack Obama warned newly elected President Donald Trump against hiring Michael Flynn as national security adviser, the White House has confirmed.

Mr Obama warned his successor less than 48 hours after the November election during a conversation in the Oval Office, former Obama officials said.

Mr Flynn's contacts with a Russian ambassador are expected to come up in a Senate hearing on Monday.

He was fired in February for concealing the nature of these contacts.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the Trump administration about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before the inauguration.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the daily briefing on Monday: ""It's true that President Obama made it known that he wasn't exactly a fan of General Flynn's.""

But Mr Spicer said that should not come as a surprise ""given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama [and] was an outspoken critic of President Obama's shortcomings specifically as it related to his lack of strategy confronting Isis and other threats around that were facing America"".

Who is Michael Flynn?

Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake

The Obama administration fired Mr Flynn from his role as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, citing issues of mismanagement and temperament.

Mr Obama's warning to Mr Trump came before concerns emerged about Mr Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador, a former Obama official told NBC News.

The Democratic president reportedly thought Mr Flynn was not suited for such a high-level position.

An ongoing feud - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

When Mr Trump sat down with Mr Obama just two days after winning the election last November, it was smiles all around. Now, according to reports, it turns out Mr Obama spent part of the time warning him to steer clear of Michael Flynn - and the president-elect ignored his advice.

In hindsight, Mr Trump would have been better served heeding his predecessor's advice, as the ensuing scandal over contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak quickly ended Flynn's controversial tenure as the president's national security advisor.

The timing of this revelation, just hours before Sally Yates is set to testify Mr Flynn's Russian ties and her own efforts to warn the Trump administration, is no fluke.

The president took a shot at the woman he fired as acting attorney general via Twitter this morning, and now Mr Obama's team is coming - anonymously - to her defence.

It's yet the latest bit of evidence of an ongoing feud between the past and present presidential administrations as well as the tension between Mr Trump's inner circle and the US intelligence community.

The stakes are high, and there's no indication anyone is backing down.

But on Monday, Mr Spicer questioned the former president's objections to Mr Flynn.

""If Mr Obama was truly concerned about General Flynn,"" the White House press secretary told reporters, ""why didn't he suspend General Flynn's security clearance, which they had just reapproved months earlier?

""Additionally, why did the Obama administration let Flynn go to Russia for a paid speaking engagement and receive a fee?""

The revelation came as former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified for the first time in public before a Senate panel about Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak.

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

Ms Yates, a 27-year Justice Department prosecutor, was fired in January by Mr Trump for refusing to uphold the administration's travel ban.

President Trump on Monday appeared to accuse Ms Yates of leaking information to media on Twitter.

He also pointed out that Mr Flynn was ""given the highest security clearance by the Obama administration"".

""But the Fake News seldom likes talking about that"", he tweeted.",bbc-news

10,"Surface Pro 5 doesn’t even exist yet, says Microsoft exec","It seems we won’t see the launch of a Surface Pro 5 any time in the near future, sadly, although Microsoft may well give the current Surface Pro 4 a spec bump at an event later this month.

There are several sources chattering about Microsoft’s hybrid range, the main one being CNET who interviewed Panos Panay, chief Surface dude at Microsoft (corporate vice president for Surface Computing, to be precise).

At the close of the interview, CNET pressed Panay on what we’ve all been wondering: that given the Surface Pro 4 is getting pretty long in the tooth, where is its successor which has previously been rumored to be incoming for a while now?

Panay essentially replied that the Surface Pro 4 would remain a competitive product for five more years, and that he was “super, super sure” of that – in other words, buy the SP4, there’s no need to hold out for a Surface Pro 5.

Mainly because the SP5 is not coming until the company develops some “meaningful changes” for the hardware. In other words, not just a processor upgrade, but a big boost on vital aspects such as battery life and/or making the device thinner and lighter (generally more portable).

Panay told CNET: “When it's meaningful and the change is right, we'll put it on market.”

He clarified: “You'll see that same meaningful impact when Pro 5, or Pro Next hits the market,"" swiftly adding that, ""there's no such thing as a Pro 5.""

In other words, there’s no such thing as a finished Surface Pro 5 design right now, meaning that it’s still a long way down the line.

These are the best laptops you can buy in the meantime

Shanghai surprise

At the same time, Microsoft has an event in Shanghai, China on May 23 which is Surface-related, where it will ‘show the world what’s next’. Panay will be there, and tweeted about the event with the hashtag #surface.

Clearly, though, this isn’t going to be the Surface Pro 5 – Panay was clear about that in the CNET interview – but Microsoft may reveal a new juiced-up Surface Pro 4 model, which matches up with what we heard from the hybrid grapevine last month, namely that a ‘Surface Pro 4.5’ was in the works.

In other words, a light refresh introducing Kaby Lake CPUs to the current range, and possibly some other minor hardware boosts. Similar to what happened with the Surface Book when Microsoft introduced the Performance Base variant (there’s still no news on the Surface Book 2, either).

As ever, this is all speculation, but at least we won’t have to wait long to see what Microsoft has planned, because this Chinese press shindig is only a couple of weeks away.",techradar
10,"The next Amazon Echo might have a screen, but does it really need one?","Part of what made the original Amazon Echo such a surprising and original product was how it completely removed the touch-screen, which has become our default way of interacting with digital devices.

But recent leaks point towards the next generation of Amazon Echo speakers coming equipped with a touch screen of their own, a dramatic change of direction for Amazon’s home-based voice assistants.

Amazon isn’t the only company reportedly considering combining a screen with a non-portable voice assistant since Apple’s rumored Siri Speaker will also reportedly feature a screen.

@AFTVnews Here, let me help you with that. pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5, 2017

But wouldn't the move negate entirely what Amazon has attempted to accomplish with Alexa? Releasing a piece of consumer electronics without a screen was a bold move, and it came with some significant challenges, but until now we’d expected Amazon to persevere with improving its audio-based interface.

Since the very first computers we’ve relied upon screens to provide the majority of their output, so it’s going to require some significant work to provide the same functionality through voice.

In spite of the challenge, I was always hoping that Amazon would struggle through and do the hard work required to make it work. Releasing a device with a screen seems to imply that the company has, at least partially, thrown in the towel.

Except Amazon has already conceded that certain actions will require a screen. Attempt to manage a to-do list using your Echo, for example, and you still currently need to use the Alexa companion app on your smartphone to tick off tasks as ‘done’. Want to change the default music player? You’ll need to dig into Alexa’s settings, on your smartphone.



So where's this heading?

It can be hard to think about the end-goal of an initiative like the Amazon Echo because nothing like it has ever existed.

But it might be helpful to think of it as being having the equivalent of personal butler sitting in your living room, waiting to help you out with your day.

Ask a butler what letters you’ve received and you’d never expect them to read out each of your letters for you, you’d hope that they’d show you the most important ones directly. In a similar way, it would get frustrating quickly to have an Echo read out your entire inbox, but an Echo with a screen could pick the most important emails to show to you.

Similarly if you were asking a butler for traffic advice, rather than them trying to describe exactly where the congestion is, it would be much for convenient for them to show you a map, and point to the difficult roads so you can avoid them. An Echo with a screen would be much better in this regard.

At a certain point, is this what the Echo is going to turn into?

Although entirely voice-based assistants seem like a cool future, the truth is that there’s certain information that will always be easier to display visually, and having to rely on pulling a smartphone out of your pocket simply isn’t as convenient as simply showing you directly on the device.

Although Amazon has yet to officially confirm the existence of the product, the quality of the leaks, combined with the existence of the recently announced Amazon Echo Look, makes this a convincing direction for Amazon to take.

And, frankly, I’m ok with it. I love my Echo, but only part of that is because it’s a smart device I can control with my voice. Mostly I just like having a mini computer set up in my kitchen to deal with occasional queries that it’s not worth fetching my phone to do.

So ultimately an Echo with a screen isn’t quite the change of direction that it had originally seemed. If handled well it could be just a better way of presenting you with the information you need without overwhelming you with minutes of lengthy audio explanation.

All that we need now is for Amazon to actually officially confirm the existence of the device, but given how finished the leaked shots look, I can’t imagine it’s far off.",techradar
10,"Apple Siri Speaker: release date, news and rumors","After first appearing on phones, voice assistants entered the home in a big way with the Amazon Echo , a speaker that was equipped with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant.

While Apple has had a voice assistant, Siri, on its phones for some time now, it has so far been left behind when it comes to smart speakers. Competitor Google brought its own voice assistant to dedicated hardware with the Google Home speaker last year.

Rumors have been circulating for a while now that both Microsoft and Apple are planning on bringing their voice assistants, Cortana and Siri respectively, to the home in the form of smart speakers.

Read on for all the information we have so far about Apple’s rumored smart speaker.

Cut to the chase

What is it? A rumored smart speaker equipped with Apple’s Siri voice assistant

A rumored smart speaker equipped with Apple’s Siri voice assistant When is it out? TBA – Apple is yet to confirm that it actually exists

TBA – Apple is yet to confirm that it actually exists What will it cost? Competitors range in price from $50 to $180 – Apple’s will likely be priced towards the high end of this range

Apple Siri Speaker release date

The most recent rumor points towards a launch in the second half of this year , in time for the Christmas shopping season, after an announcement at Apple’s annual developer showcase, WWDC, which this year takes place in June.

However we’re slightly skeptical of this rumor for a couple of reasons.

First is the fact that WWDC is traditionally a conference where Apple talks about software rather than hardware, so talking about a new piece of smart speaker hardware would be highly unusual.

Secondly we’re skeptical that the speaker would be announced as early as WWDC, only to be released much later in the second half of the year, as Apple likes to release hardware as soon as possible after it’s announced; each year the iPhone is released just 10 days after its initial announcement, for example.

There have been exceptions to this rule such as the AirPods , which released around three months after they were originally announced, but for the most part Apple maintains a fast turnaround between announcement and release.

Unfortunately this doesn’t leave us with much of an idea about when the smart speaker might be coming, but after hearing that Apple employees are already testing prototypes in their own homes , we’re guessing it’s not far away .

Apple Siri Speaker features

If you want to get an idea of what a Siri speaker would be capable of, then Siri on your iPhone is a good place to start.

Currently Siri is able to sync up with a number of the iPhone’s core features. It can add reminders to the reminders app, create events in the calendar app, set alarms and timers, call and video ""Facetime"" call contacts, and find and read emails.

Siri is also heavily integrated into Apple HomeKit , which is the company’s home automation ecosystem, that allows you to control all of your connected devices from a single app. Using HomeKit you can have Siri turn on your lights, increase your home’s thermostat, or even activate a ceiling fan.

Check out our full list of the devices that work, or will work, with Apple HomeKit .

However, Siri has some significant problems compared to competing voice services.

For example, it heavily prioritises Apple’s own apps rather than allowing you to use alternatives. Ask Siri to play some music, and it will only be able to play songs that are currently stored in your Apple Music app.

This is in contrast to both Alexa and Google Assistant, which both allow you to use a music app of your choice, rather than restricting you to Amazon Prime Music and Google Play music respectively.

Amazon has been especially open with allowing developers to integrate their services into its smart speakers. It allows the creation of ‘Skills’ which essentially act as apps for the smart speaker, and so far there have been over 10,000 of them created for the speaker .

On a basic intelligence level, Siri also has a number of problems. Ask it when the Mona Lisa was painted (the year 1503, art buffs), and the voice assistant will happily tell you that ‘the answer is one thousand, five hundred and three,’ rather than being intelligent enough to realise that the year should be read aloud as ‘fifteen oh-three’.

Of course there’s always the chance that Apple will put significant effort into improving Siri before the technology finds its way into a smart speaker. Google did a similar thing when it overhauled Google Now, creating Google Assistant, in the months before the Google Home was released.

Meanwhile, recent comments by Apple VP Phil Schiller suggest Apple is thinking along the lines of a Siri speaker with an integrated screen - so basically just a big iPad with better audio, then?

Facial recognition

Previously, smart speakers focussed entirely on the voice, and recognising the commands that are spoken by the user.

However, there are some rumors that Apple’s rumored smart speaker might feature facial recognition via a built-in camera.

The technology could be used to recognise which users are interacting with the device, allowing it to cater to their individual preferences in music or lighting.

Over the past two years Apple has acquired the facial recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient, which suggests that such technology is something that the company is exploring.

Apple’s speaker would not be the first to feature a built-in camera. The recently announced Amazon Echo Look has a built in camera, which is used to recognise and recommend clothing choices.

Google Home recently added the ability to recognise users based on the sound of their voice , and we’d imagine that Apple would want to feature similar functionality if it wants to compete with the existing major players in the market.



Emotion sensing

Related to the facial recognition capability is a recent rumor that the smart speaker will be able to recognise user’s emotions .

We’re not entirely sure what this could end up adding to the overall user experience, but it’s funny to think that the speaker could theoretically play different music depending on how it reads your mood.

Beats technology

Another recent rumor points towards the device making use of ‘some form of Beats technology’, although it’s unclear exactly what this could be.

It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS27 April 2017

Apple needs to improve Siri’s ability to recognise our voice, since we’ve found that its current implementation on phones can be a little flaky. Could a Beats-built microphone fit the bill?

The big development with Beats headphones over the last year has been the introduction of Apple's new W1 bluetooth chip, which makes it a lot easier to pair the headphones to an iPhone, and also improves battery life.

Obviously that latter point isn't as important for a speaker that's likely to be mains, rather than battery, powered, but it would be a great feature if the speaker could be easily paired to your phone by simply holding it close by. Could this perhaps be another way of identifying the user – by proximity to the W1 chip?

Apple Siri Speaker AirPlay

The Amazon Echo Dot has a 3.5mm audio jack output that allows it to plug into a stereo, and Google Home integrates with the Chromecast.

Allegedly Apple’s Siri speaker will offer similar functionality thanks to an integration with Apple’s AirPlay technology, which allows users to stream video and audio from their phone to a television or stereo respectively.

Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device.27 April 2017

A new challenger has entered the arena

Smart speakers are one of the most unexpected and cool technologies to have come out over the past couple of years, and interesting to see each of the technology giants repurposing their existing voice assistants to work in a home context.

Apple isn't the only one with such a device on the horizon. Microsoft appears to be readying a home speaker equipped with its Cortana voice assistant, and between that and Google's existing smart speaker efforts, the market is set to get crowded very quickly.

Apple has a real chance of standing out when it comes to its home automation efforts thanks to HomeKit, but it's not as strong when it comes to integrating with non-Apple services such as Spotify.

Apple's next major conference is set to be WWDC in June, but as previously mentioned, we would be surprised to see a hardware reveal come out of the software-focussed show.

Then again when it comes to Apple anything is possible, so keep your eyes trained on the McEnery Convention Centre in San Jose from 5-9 June for any new information about Apple's voice controlled ambitions.",techradar

10,BlackBerry KeyOne review,"BlackBerry KeyOne is a sophisticated-looking smartphone that resurrects a physical keyboard in the modern Android era. Its tactical QWERTY keyboard offers a dose of nostalgia, while its smart and secure software give businesses some peace of mind. Just know that the mid-range specs will only get you so far and its entertainment capabilities make this BlackBerry feel as if it clocks out at 5pm sharp when it comes to the fun stuff.

Move over, Samsung Galaxy S8 . The BlackBerry KeyOne is the latest smartphone comeback story of 2017, even if the company behind it is really China’s TCL Communications.

It’s touted as the most secure Android phone, pre-loaded with smart, enterprise-level mobile software and, at last, delivers an old-school physical keyboard within a modern enough design.

This is the reinvented BlackBerry for everyone wholly determined to reclaim a tactile keyboard and BlackBerry Messenger. It works great for typing once you get used to the keyboard again.

‘CrackBerry’ addicts have something to look forward to here. But it’s a workaholic. BlackBerry KeyOne is all business in the front and back, less of a multimedia party anywhere in between.

The screen is bright and colorful, but its 3:2 aspect ratio leaves you with black bars on all 16:9 video and small-looking movies. The audio comes out one bottom-firing speaker. It’s like this phone clocks out at 5pm sharp when it comes to the fun stuff.

BlackBerry KeyOne is clearly an Android phone that has productivity users in mind. It’s one of the best at helping you manage tasks, even if it doesn’t have the latest chipset. It works as an entertainment device, too, but it’s not the best at it.

Does this new BlackBerry phone have enough of an enterprise advantage to lure you back from your on-screen, makebelieve keyboard? Let’s get down to business and put it to the test.

Price and release date

£499 in the UK at Selfridges and Carphone Warehouse

$549 in the US unlocked on May 31 and on-contract via Sprint later this summer

The BlackBerry KeyOne price is somewhere in between Wall Street and Main Street, costing $549 (£499, AU$729). It’s cheaper than an iPhone 7 or the Samsung Galaxy S8.

What it lacks in top-of-the-line internal chip specs it tries to make up for with unique features like sophisticated software and its physical keyboard. It’s a trade-off that makes it slightly cheaper.

There are two versions of the BlackBerry KeyOne in the US: an unlocked version that’s GSM and CDMA capable across the networks, and a summer-bound CDMA model for Sprint.

If you're lucky enough to be in or around London, England, you can get your hands on a BlackBerry KeyOne right now - with prestigious store Selfridges securing world exclusive availability until May 5.

After May 5, you'll be able to purchase the KeyOne throughout the UK at Carphone Warehouse, with more retailers and carriers coming on board through the month.

The BlackBerry KeyOne US release date is a longer wait. The unlocked model is scheduled for May 31, with the same on-sale date in Canada, too.

Keyboard

BlackBerry's signature keys return, spurning the new all-screen trend

Makes for a more precise, but slow typing experience

Neat tricks: 52 key shortcuts, trackpad-like movement and suggested word-flicking gestures

The Blackberry KeyOne is all about its physical keyboard in a world dominated by touchscreen iPhones and Androids. It’s the exact opposite of the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 all-screen trend.

BlackBerry’s signature keyboard is a welcomed change if you miss the tactile feedback of a real smartphone keyboard. It’s a throwback to a time before throwback Thursday was ‘a thing.’

It’s a throwback to everyone’s old Monday through Friday daily driver with 35-chicklet-style keys, and each one it properly backlit. There’s no need for an on-screen keyboard to hog your display.

It does take several hours of typing to re-learn how use it. At first, it’s problematic. B shares a key with ! and caused us to say “How’s your day goingB” with quickly apologize. “Sorry, mom.”

We found ourselves making fewer mistakes going back to a BlackBerry, but overall slower at typing. While we sped up our characters-per-minute output over time, we were never faster versus typing on an on-screen keyboard. Just more accurate and less autocorrect dependent.

There are several new twists to make life easier. It has 52 customizable shortcuts, so every long and short press gets you somewhere faster. Hold down on the ‘I’ key while on the home screen and you instantly get to Instagram.

Blackberry KeyOne has three-word suggestions across the bottom of the touchscreen as part of its contextual next word prediction engine. It’s smart, but could use punctuation predictions.

Also, don’t expect helpful emoji predictions like you would on iOS 10 . That’s too fun for a BlackBerry. Emojis are buried two menus deep.

You can, however, select a suggested word without ever lifting your thumbs from the keyboard. Just slide up on the keys and it’ll almost flick the word right onto the screen.

This word-flicking gesture works most of the time in one upward motion and feels slightly faster than tapping one of the on-screen choices. At times, we’d accidentally hit one of the capacitive buttons – home, back or recent – which sit in between the screen and keyboard.

The entire keyboard also acts as a trackpad, so you can scroll through menus and web pages as you lightly pet the keys. You, again, don’t need to put your fingers on the screen.

Flicking suggested words onto the screen and scrolling with the keyboard makes the screen feel slightly bigger, though we did run into instances where we tried to begin typing a text and were suddenly scrolling up our message history.

Phone design

Two-tone sophisticated look: black soft touch back and silver accents

Biometric fingerprint scanner is hidden inside the space bar

Ironically named connivence key is more annoying than it is helpful

Strangely, no dual-SIM option for international business travelers

The BlackBerry KeyOne has an air of sophistication to it, even as it blends the old and the new technology. It looks like a productivity tool carried by the workforce elite.

Its screen-and-keyboard combo is outlined in a silver anodized aluminum frame and backed by a black, soft grip textured rear cover. This stylish, two-toned look is has real character.

No, the rubberized back isn’t really leather, but it gives off that impression. The anodized aluminum frame is scratch-resistant and stood up to some completely on purpose minor abuse.

The most clever thing about this new BlackBerry design is that it hides the fingerprint sensor inside the small space bar at the bottom of the phone. It’s an odd shape for a biometric scanner.

The good news is that the blended fingerprint sensor works really well here with a near 0% fail rate. It’s also easy to access on the front and it can wake the phone from a screen-off state.

BlackBerry KeyOne likes to mix things up when it comes to the its buttons and headphone jack. The power is on the left side, the volume rocker is on the right and the 3.5mm jack is at the top. It’s like this grown-up smartphone is secretly a kid still playing opposite day.

There’s another button – the convenience button – that throws one more shortcut into design. It can be mapped to anything you want, unlike Samsung’s draconian Bixby button that does little.

We mapped the convenience button to launch the camera app, but found it more annoying than helpful due to its easy-to-mispress location. “Oh, the camera is open... again.”

During calls, it functions as a mute button, which we found useful. It’s easy to remember this button exists during active calls, not when you’re first picking up your smartphone from a table. “Again, with the camera opening?!”

KeyOne is the second BlackBerry to use USB-C (after last year’s BlackBerry DTEK60 ) and this new, reversible USB standard is a helpful change, as it uses Quick Charge 3.0 for faster charging. Your old collection of monodirectional BlackBerry mini and micro USB cables are now useless.

There are two changes we would have liked to see in an otherwise great update the BlackBerry design. The mono speaker on the bottom frame helps no one, on-the-go entertainment seekers and business speakerphone devotees alike.

We’re also surprised the the BlackBerry KeyOne doesn’t have a dual nano SIM tray when many unlocked phones out of China now have options for using either a second SIM or microSD card. This just has the latter expandable storage option, not dual-SIM to the chagrin of jet-setting international business travelers.

Screen

4.5-inch Full HD screen feels like a 5.5-inch screen due to bigger width and your thumbs staying put on the keyboard

The bright display looks great, but its 3:2 aspect ratio forces 16:9 video to feel small by placing black bars at the top and bottom

This is not a multimedia showstopper, it's a workhorse

The BlackBerry KeyOne display shares the front face of the phone with the keyboard, so it can’t compare to an trendy new all-screen Android phone. You just can have everything in life.

What it does is give you a bright, but misshapen 4.5-inch Full HD screen. One third of the real estate taken up by non-screen parts (keyboard, capacitive buttons and a front-facing camera).

It feels like a 5.5-inch display thanks to its familiar 3-inch width, and we wouldn’t want it much longer. Anything taller would make this already 180g phone feel top-heavy when holding the very bottom of the keyboard.

We end up with a screen that’s bright, colorful and gives you more usable space thanks to the the keyboard and trackpad-like scrolling. But not every app adjusts to a 1,620 x 1,080 resolution.

You’re going to run into problems with the 3:2 aspect ratio on a daily basis. All 16:9 video feels extra small with top and bottom black bars. Snapchats and Instagram Stories are also cut off.

The good news is that most scrollable productivity apps and interactive games adapt to the size. It’s just movies and fixed-length photo apps that give the BlackBerry KeyOne trouble.

You’ll find split-screen multitasking thanks to Android 7.1 Nougat, but it’s a bit cramped. There are a few sacrifices if you want a keyboard on a smartphone in the modern day.",techradar
10,"Star Wars Battlefront 2 release date, news and rumors","Update: Rumors are circulating that Star Wars Battlefront 2 could feature some kind of VR content. NeoGaf users in European territories have spotted PlayStation promotional materials that have a ""compatible with VR"" badge on them.

This in combination with tweets from Alex Mole, CTO of VR mission development team Criterion, which stated his team were collaborating on ""something awesome"" in the sequel means there is a chance of some more VR Star Wars content in the future.

Original article continues below...

Things are pretty great for Star Wars fans at the moment: not only are new films coming on the regular, according to EA's Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen there are going to be a handful of games from various studios too.

The next exciting title in the Star Wars franchise is, of course, EA Dice’s Battlefront 2, the sequel to the franchise reboot first released in 2015.

When it was first released, Star Wars Battlefront received a mixed reception with some praising how it captured the Star Wars atmosphere perfectly with its excellent cinematic visuals while others bemoaned its repetitive combat and limited depth and content.

In spite of criticisms, the game still sold over 14 million copies and counting. With a sequel on the way, though, EA has the chance to learn from the first release and create something bigger and better.

If these words from EA CFO Blake Jorgensen are anything to go by, that’s exactly what we’re going to get: “If there was criticism, they just wanted more. So we're taking that criticism to heart as we build the next game and trying to address any of the issues that they had.”

And address it they have.

Cut to the chase

What is it? The sequel to the multiplayer-focused shooter Star Wars Battlefront

The sequel to the multiplayer-focused shooter Star Wars Battlefront When can I play it? November 17 2017

November 17 2017 What can I play it on? PS4, Xbox One and PC

Trailers and screenshots

The Star Wars Battlefront 2 trailer has been a story in and of itself. First we saw leaked version before the trailer was originally set to launch before it was pulled down much to our chagrin. But that all changed on April 15 when we got the official trailer during a panel at Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.

The trailer gives fans a glimpse of the game's single-player campaign which it appears will revolve around an ""untold soldier's story"" in the Empire. As well as this single-player campaign that appears to be set in the period following the Empire's defeat at Endor, there'll also be a multiplayer mode of the game which will span ""across all eras.""

This means we'll see locations and characters from the series' original trilogy as well as the prequels and new films. The trailer gives us a look at characters like Rey, Kylo Ren, Yoda and Darth Maul across a variety of locations. It also looks like there will indeed be exciting space battles involved.

Release date

Turns out, November and December are going to be great months for Star Wars fans. Star Wars Battlefront 2 will see a worldwide release on November 17 2017, followed shortly by the theatrical release of Star Wars Episode 8 The Last Jedi one month later on December 15.

What this means is that the game will be out slightly ahead of the movie – and thus has the potential to give us a brief look at new locations and new ships from the upcoming film.

That being said, those who pre-order the game will have access to two new skins – Episode 8 variations of Kylo Ren and Rey – as well as two new ships – the Episode 8 variation of the Millennium Falcon and a yet undisclosed ship from the new movie.

What we know we'll see

Thanks to the Star Wars Celebration panel, we now have expert insight into what we can expect when the game comes out. There are two important new additions here: a story mode and space battles.

Single player campaign

Let's start first by looking at the game's new single-player mode.

In it, you'll play as Iden Versio, a member of the Imperial Forces elite ops unit called Inferno Squad, a combination of expert Tie Pilots and covert commandos. During the trailer for the game we watch Iden witness the destruction of the second Death Star above the moon of Endor. Without direct missions from the now-deceased Emperor, Iden leads her squad on a mission of revenge to try and quell the Rebellion.

To that end, Battlefront II will occupy the time between the sixth film of the franchise, Return of the Jedi, and the seventh film, The Force Awakens.

After the battle on Endor, players will travel to Iden's homeworld, a planet that has been under Imperial control for the entirety of her life. Instead of an martial law-loving Imperial city that we've seen in the past, however, Ida's homeworld has come to embrace and love the Empire. This love hits home the theme that the single-player campaign is going for, which is that yes, the Rebellion had heroes, but so did the Empire.

In a recent interview with Eurogamer single player game director Mark Thompson and Criterion's Matt Webster revealed that the single player campaign will be “a continuous story with a beginning a middle and an end” rather than separate missions and war stories like Battlefield 1.

Players will follow Iden for 30 years, from the end of Jedi up to the Force Awakens at Starkiller base, though there will be moments in the story where the player will switch sides and play ""from the perspective of one of the iconic heroes because [...] that’s just part of Battlefront’s DNA.”

In the trailer it was revealed that Iden will have a droid. According to Thompson, this droid will offer players a way to customize their play style while they're playing as Iden. For example, he says it will offer them choice when it comes to how they engage in a combat scenario so we imagine the droid will be able to be used as back up in combat, as a scout or perhaps even as a tool for hacking.

Considering the Motive development team has been brought in to work on the single-player specifically, there’s little chance of it feeling like a tacked on afterthought and we're excited to see how this will play out.

It's been confirmed that Battlefront 2 will explore characters, locations and events from the new films and prequel trilogy as well as the original trilogy.

That means that in addition to characters like Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo and Boba Fett, players will get to take control of characters such as Rey, Kylo Ren, Yoda and Darth Maul.

The other interesting addition in this iteration will be space battles. These will be developed by Criterion and will allow players to engage in epic dogfights over some of the most iconic battlefields in the Star Wars universe.

Combat with depth

In a recent interview with PC Gamer, Star Wars Battlefront 2's creative director Bern Diemer said that DICE wants to add depth the game's multiplayer modes.

This time around Heroes will apparently not be all-powerful game changers as they once were. As well as making Heroes more present and not restricted to a ""lucky few"" players, DICE will add something called team play to make sure that those playing as standard troopers are not at an unfair advantage.

Team play is based on classes and leveling and encourages players to join up with their friends in well-balanced squads in order to take down heroes.

Matt Webster revealed that there will be 4 Trooper classes which are differentiated by standard things like range and firepower.

There will, apparently be ""customization and progression inside the Trooper classes, inside Heroes and inside Starfighters. So whilst they have clear lines of class types, there is customization within those.""

Webster said they'll reveal exactly how that will work at a later date, but we imagine gadgets will have something to do with it as Diemer told PC Gamer that to improve personalization and depth, abilities and gadgets will also be introduced. According to Diemer different classes in the game will have access to different items.

For example, Diemer said that troopers don't really ""have a personality"" and to give them one ""you need to be able to customize them in some way so it feels right. I really like using grenades, so I might try to pull my class a little bit towards my favorite toy or my favorite gadget.”

It's also been confirmed that there will be no more blue pick ups to become a Hero character, with Webster explaining that “it was becoming a brief experience for the lucky few, or people were just hunting and hanging around the spawn locations for tokens. So we wanted to expand the hero play within a battle, we wanted to increase that scope but also have a better system for players to be able to become a hero than just picking up a token.”

This addition of classes and squads brings Battlefront 2 more in line with DICE's other multiplayer shooter releases such as Battlefield.

Will there be VR?

It’s been revealed that Rogue One: X-Wing VR Mission developer Criterion is involved in the development of Battlefront 2 which points to the idea that there will perhaps be some VR content involved with the game, or at least the addition of some epic space battle missions.

In a recent interview, it was revealed that as far as the team is concerned “We are not talking about VR at the moment for Battlefront 2. That's a story for another day…” That's not a direct no, but it does confirm that Criterion's main involvement is with regards to improving space battles and making them more dynamic and open.

What we'd like to see

Diversity in game modes

It’s not that there was a dearth of modes in the first Battlefront game, but after a while they all began to feel very similar. Something we’d really like to see in Battlefront 2 is either more game modes that feel a little different or at the very least the same number of game modes, just with some tweaks to make them feel a little more distinct from one another.

Some free or cheaper content

The original Battlefront has free content and that’s great but the content it charges for felt slightly too expensive, especially alongside the use of micro-transactions. So, what can the sequel do to change that?

Well, first off, eliminating paid DLC would be a good first step – and, from the sounds of it, that's exactly what's going to happen. According to IGN, Star Wars Battlefront II won't offer a season pass this time around, meaning that DLC will most likely be supplied for free.

The DLC for the first game was pretty pricey considering the cost of the original game but for many players it became a necessary purchase to continue enjoying the game as older maps lost their popularity and it became a struggle to find good matches using them.

Split-screen co-op

Our last request is for split-screen co-op. This was an important feature of the first two games made by Pandemic, and yet wasn't included in the series' return.

Allowing two players to use the same screen (what we refer to endearingly as couch co-op) harkens back to the game's original design philosophy and will surely make long-time fans of the series happy. And really, don't we all want to be happy?",techradar
6,Sally Yates to offer first public account of Flynn's Russia contacts,"Sally Yates speaks during a press conference at the Department of Justice on June 28, 2016. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — Sally Yates largely avoided the public spotlight when she served as deputy attorney general during the final two years of the Obama administration.

That all changed — dramatically — in the 10 days she spent as acting attorney general during the infancy of the Trump administration.

The career federal prosecutor from Georgia, a holdover from the Obama Justice Department, was abruptly fired Jan. 30 for refusing to defend the new president’s controversial travel ban in court.

Yet it is the extraordinary warning she delivered just four days earlier to the White House counsel’s office about former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn that is the reason for her testimony to Congress on Monday.

It's perhaps the most-anticipated congressional hearing since FBI Director James Comey publicly acknowledged last month that the bureau was investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

For the first time publicly, Yates is expected to recount to a Senate panel a Jan. 26 meeting in which she alerted White House Counsel Don McGahn that Flynn had lied to administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump's inauguration. Those misrepresentations, Yates would maintain, made the former Army lieutenant general vulnerable to possible blackmail.

The specter of Yates' testimony was not lost on Trump, who early Monday fired off two tweets distancing the administration from Flynn while suggesting that Yates may have leaked information about her actions related to the former national security adviser.

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,'' Trump said. ""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council (sic).''

What remains troubling about Flynn's contacts, according to officials who have previously described the communications, was that the former general had talked with the ambassador about sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. Those conversations were secretly monitored by federal authorities, as are most communications involving foreign diplomats.

Pence, meanwhile, had said he had been assured by Flynn that the subject of sanctions was not raised in the Kislyak conversations.

Shortly after Yates' warnings were made public, Flynn was forced to resign, ending the shortest tenure of any president's national security adviser – while stoking further suspicion about the ties between Trump associates and Russian officials.

Since then, Flynn and former Trump advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone have become the subjects of fresh scrutiny about their Russian ties.

On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that Trump transition team members had warned Flynn about the risks of communicating with the Russian ambassador, prior to the his December telephone conversations with Kislyak. According to the report, Flynn was told in November that the ambassador's communications were likely being monitored by U.S. authorities.

Separately, the Senate Intelligence Committee, which along with the House Intelligence Committee are conducting a parallel inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, recently asked the advisers to provide information about their activities.

Flynn also is now under investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General for failing to inform Defense Department officials about seeking payments from foreign governments.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is leading Monday's Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing, has said the panel's examination is necessary to ""hold [Russia] accountable.''

""Based on evidence presented by our intelligence and law enforcement communities, I believe Russia interfered in our election,'' Graham has said. ""I do not believe it changed the outcome, but I have no doubt they interfered.'' The U.S. intelligence community has accused Moscow of orchestrating a campaign of cyberattacks to hack Democratic political organizations and release stolen information to undermine confidence in the American election.

It is not immediately clear how much new information Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also is scheduled to testify Monday, will be able provide. Both witnesses are likely to be constrained by the classified nature of the information surrounding the events they were privy to.

In March, when Yates' attorney had notified the Justice Department and White House of her intent to appear at a previously scheduled House Intelligence Committee hearing, the attorney was warned that Yates' testimony could contained privileged communications that might be barred.

Ultimately, Yates' scheduled March 28 appearance was canceled.

Trump spokesman Sean Spicer has since indicated that the White House has no objection to Yates' testifying. And last week , Graham signaled that senators will ask Yates about what other possible considerations drove her to alert the White House counsel about her concerns for Flynn.

Responding to a series of questions from Graham, FBI Director James Comey recalled in separate testimony last Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he met with Yates to discuss her concerns about Flynn's activities. The meeting occurred after FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

Comey declined to elaborate on the meeting with Yates in the open committee session.

Attorneys for Yates and Flynn did not respond to inquiries seeking comment.

Flynn, meanwhile, has sought immunity from any possible prosecution. Both the House and Senate Intelligence committees, in the midst of continuing Russia probes, have indicated that it is too early in their investigations to cut a deal for Flynn's testimony. Separately, preliminary discussions about Flynn's prospects for immunity in the FBI investigation also have yielded no agreement.

In a pointed speech on Sunday, former President Obama took aim at his successor in the White House — and at congressional Republicans who are pushing to repeal his signature health care law.

Speaking at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston as he accepted the annual Profile in Courage Award, Obama noted that in 2010, several lawmakers lost their congressional seats after voting for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These men and women, he said, “did the right thing. Theirs was a profile in courage.”

Obama then told the crowd, “I hope that current members of Congress recall that it actually doesn’t take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. But it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm — those who often have no access to the corridors of power.”

The speech came just three days after House Republicans narrowly voted to repeal ACA on a 217-213 vote. The measure passed without any support from Democrats and in spite of a handful of ""No"" votes from mostly moderate Republicans. It faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, where Republicans hold just a four-seat majority.

RELATED COVERAGE

Obama warned lawmakers, “I hope they understand that courage means not simply doing what’s politically expedient, but doing what, deep in our hearts, we know is right.”

Recalling the early fights in Congress for ACA at the beginning of his presidency, Obama on Sunday also took a jab at President Trump’s comment to governors last February, when Trump told them, ""Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.""

Obama got a laugh on Sunday, telling the crowd, “There was a reason why healthcare reform had not been accomplished before: it was hard.”

He also indirectly criticized Trump’s efforts to deport millions of illegal immigrants and ban travelers from Muslim-majority countries, warning Americans against “falling into the refuge of tribe and clan and anger at those who don’t look at us, or have the same surnames, or pray the way we do.”

He added, “At such moments, courage is necessary. At such moments we need courage to stand up to hate — not just in others but in ourselves. At such moments we need the courage to stand up to dogma — not just in others but in ourselves.”

Obama also warned against cynicism about our political system, saying: “Justice and freedom and equality and kindness and generosity — it doesn’t happen on its own … We are constantly having to make a choice because progress is fragile.”

One reason Obama received the award, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation noted, was for expanding health security to millions of Americans. Obama joins Republican presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, NBC News reported.

The award is named for a 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by JFK that profiled eight U.S. senators who risked their careers by taking principled though unpopular positions. May 29 would have been his 100th birthday.

Obama, 55, thanked Kennedy for leading “with a steady hand” during the Cold War in general and the Cuban Missile Crisis specifically — and for showing his generation that “politics could be a noble and worthwhile pursuit.” He noted that the example of JFK and his brother Robert F. Kennedy “helped guide me into politics.” Their younger brother, longtime Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, “helped make me a better public servant once I arrived in Washington,” Obama said.

At Sunday’s ceremony, Jack Schlossberg, JFK's grandson, introduced Obama, saying, ""Without President Obama, I might still be sitting on my couch eating Doritos and watching sports.""

The former president also thanked former first lady Michelle Obama “for, after the presidency, sticking with me, because I think she felt an obligation to the country to stay on. But once her official duties were over, it wasn’t clear.”

6,Trump names 10 conservatives to federal courts,"President Trump nominated 10 federal court judges Monday at a time when three Supreme Court justices -- including Anthony Kennedy, here with Trump at the swearing-in of newly confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch last month -- could be stepping down in the coming years. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA)

WASHINGTON — President Trump borrowed a page from George W. Bush's playbook Monday by nominating 10 federal court judges en masse, almost 16 years to the day that Bush named 11 appeals court judges — including a Washington lawyer named John Roberts who soon became chief justice of the United States.

Trump's action represents the opening salvo in what will be at least four years of battles with Senate Democrats over the federal judiciary, one that the president intends to pack with conservatives after President Barack Obama spent eight years tilting nearly every circuit court to the left.

It also elevates some rising legal stars who made it on to Trump's original list of 21 potential Supreme Court justices last year, putting them closer to the nation's high court at a time when Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's swing vote, is contemplating retirement and two liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, are long past the average retirement age.

Two judges from that list were among the 10 nominees named Monday. Joan Larsen, 48, a Michigan Supreme Court justice, was nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. David Stras, 42, a Minnesota Supreme Court justice, was nominated for the 8th Circuit. Previously, federal district court Judge Amul Thapar of Kentucky, who also made Trump's high court list, was nominated to the 6th Circuit.

Others named to federal appeals courts Monday were Notre Dame law professor Amy Coney Barrett, Kentucky lawyer John Bush and former Alabama solicitor general Kevin Newsom. Those named to district courts were Dabney Friedrich, Terry Moorer, David Nye and Scott Palk, while Damien Schiff was named to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

Read more:

Conservative legal activists applauded the new nominees, just as they had Trump's selection in January of federal appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court seat vacated a year earlier by Justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch, 49, was confirmed last month.

""When it comes to fulfilling his campaign promise to appoint strong, principled judges, Trump is knocking it out of the park,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which spent millions of dollars to help win Gorsuch's confirmation.

Combined with Thapar's earlier nomination, Trump now has nominated six people to serve on federal appeals courts, the traditional stepping stones to the Supreme Court. That's one-fourth of the total number of vacancies on those regional courts. Trump's five other nominations Monday were to lower courts.

""The large number of judicial vacancies gives President Trump a historic opportunity to move the federal courts in the right direction -- towards constitutionalism and away from judicial activism -- in just four years,"" said Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice.

It took Obama eight years to liberalize a majority of federal appeals courts. At the end of Bush's presidency, 10 of the 13 circuit courts had a majority of judges nominated by Republican presidents. Today, nine of them have a majority of Democratic presidents' nominees — including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, which will hear oral arguments Monday on the administration's effort to impose a travel ban on immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries.

Trump can reverse that advantage in just one term, establishing Republican control over nine appeals courts and leaving three others deadlocked, based on current retirement trends. Only the special appeals court created in 1982 to hear patent and trademark cases would retain a majority of Democratic appointees.

The projected reversal is crucial, because while the Supreme Court hears only about 75 cases each term, the appeals courts hear some 30,000. Only the most significant or divisive find their way to the high court, which has slashed its caseload in recent decades.

Federal appeals courts have played a particularly crucial role in the past year. Scalia's death in February 2016 left the Supreme Court with only eight members. Republicans' refusal to confirm Obama's nominee — Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the D.C. Circuit court — forced the justices to leave lower court rulings on Obama's immigration plan and the power of labor unions intact following 4-4 votes. Only last month did Gorsuch win confirmation and assume Scalia's seat.

Senate Republicans and Democrats view the appeals courts as so important that confirmation battles have stretched longer than two years and led some nominees to withdraw from consideration. One of those nominated by Bush on May 9, 2001, was Miguel Estrada, considered at the time a potential future Supreme Court nominee. He was blocked by Senate Democrats for more than two years and ultimately withdrew.

The impact of appeals court judges is clear. Judges named by Obama to federal appellate and district courts overseeing North Carolina, Texas, Michigan and Wisconsin voted during the recent political campaign season against restrictions on voting imposed by Republican legislatures. In states where Obama's judges had less influence, such as Ohio and Virginia, courts left restrictions on voting in place.

Looking ahead, Trump's appeals court judges could play major roles in cases testing the ability of religious objectors to sidestep government regulations, as well as cases involving the rights of criminal defendants. The Supreme Court's decision in June striking down abortion restrictions in Texas still leaves appeals courts with the job of deciding which types of limits to permit.

Another major impact Obama had on lower federal courts could be tested under Trump: the increased prevalence of women, minorities, gays and lesbians. About 43% of all his nominees were women and 36% minorities, surpassing previous records under Bill Clinton. Republican presidents have nominated less than half that number.

16,Coach to acquire Kate Spade for $2.4 billion,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In a blockbuster deal, Coach will buy Kate Spade for $2.4 billion dollars, in cash. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60

Colorado Scenics

Accessories seller Coach said Monday that it had reached a deal to acquire upscale retailer Kate Spade in a shakeup for the luxury goods industry as it grapples with sluggish sales.

Coach said it would pay $2.4 billion for Kate Spade, which it plans to maintain as an independent brand with its own stores.

Kate Spade's connection with Millennials, who represent 60% of its customers, and international growth potential appealed to Coach.

""It is a strong brand with a clear and consistent positioning, with leadership in the attributes of fashionable, fun and feminine, and a growing share of Millennials,"" Coach CEO Victor Luis said in a conference call.

Although Luis said Kate Spade would be afforded the autonomy to make its own design and marketing decisions, he said the company had become ""too dependent"" on online sales and wholesale distribution.

Those channels ""can lead to meaningful brand deterioration over time,"" and Coach will cut back on both, Luis said.

The acquirer said it expects to shed $50 million in annual costs within three years after completing the deal. That will include ""supply chain optimization"" and elimination of overlapping costs, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Wills said.

Coach said it had identified global expansion opportunity through opening Kate Spade specialty stores. Globally, Kate Spade has 133 specialty stores, 82 outlet stores and 54 stores similar to franchises exclusively in foreign markets.

The company opened 52 new locations in 2016, which helped boost net income and overall sales.

But sales per square foot at stores open at least a year fell 2.4% in the 12-month period ending Oct. 1, underscoring the retailer's challenges, including a sluggish luxury market, lower growth in China and unfavorable currency rates.

Kate Spade CEO Craig Leavitt told investors that the deal will allow the brand to ""achieve long-term success"" after working ""hard to create a clear and distinct brand identity, differentiated storytelling and great products.""

Luis said there ""may be some slight opportunities"" to close stores in markets where the two retailers compete, ""but we see it as very, very minimal."" He said only 35% of Kate Spade stores overlap with Coach locations.

Among the growth opportunities is China, where only 1% of consumers can name the Kate Spade brand without prompting, while 23% can name the Coach brand, Luis said.

While Kate Spade has been expanding, Coach has been reducing its own retail footprint in North America, where the company closed 30 retail stores in the fiscal year ended July 2.

Coach ended the period with 228 retail stores and 204 outlet stores in North America, 522 Coach locations internationally and 75 Stuart Weitzman stores.

The deal is ""somewhat surprising"" because it comes as Coach's ""turnaround plan seems to be taking hold,"" CFRA Research analyst Tuna Amobi said in a bulletin.

Coach investors applauded the deal, as the company's stock increased 5.5% to $45.01 in mid-morning trading.

Kate Spade had confirmed in February that it was considering ""strategic alternatives,"" as the handbag, clothing, shoes and accessories seller faces a strong U.S. dollar that is dampening foreign tourist spending.

The companies said their boards had unanimously authorized the deal, which they expect to close in the third quarter.

Coach is paying $18.50 per share for Kate Spade. That's 27.5% more than the stock was worth on Dec. 27, before rumors of a possible deal surfaced.

Kate Spade shares rose 8.1% to $18.34 at 9:53 a.m.

CHICAGO — Aaron Hicks slid across home plate, hopped up and flexed his arms in jubilation.

No Monday morning blues for Hicks and the New York Yankees.

Hicks scored on Starlin Castro’s grounder in the 18th inning, and the rolling Yankees beat the Chicago Cubs 5-4 in the majors’ longest interleague game ever by innings.

“We’re going to grind out games,” Hicks said. “We’re going to fight to the end.”

The teams combined for a major league-record 48 strikeouts in baseball’s longest game of the season by innings, wrapping up in a tidy 6 hours, 5 minutes.

“I know we lost, but you’ve got to try to have fun with it,” Cubs slugger Anthony Rizzo said.

Hicks struck out four times, but he came up with a huge play in the final inning. He led off with a bunt single against Pedro Strop (0-2) and advanced to second when catcher Willson Contreras threw the ball into right field for an error.

With one out and Hicks on third, Castro hit a bouncer up the middle. Shortstop Addison Russell tried to throw home, but it was wide and Hicks scored easily.

Chasen Shreve (1-0) pitched three scoreless innings, striking out pinch-hitting pitcher Kyle Hendricks with runners on first and second for the final out in New York’s fifth straight win. The Yankees (20-9) improved to 19-5 since they opened the season with four losses in five games. They also matched their high-water mark from last season at 11 games over. 500.

“It’s just a crazy game,” manager Joe Girardi said.

Chicago trailed 4-1 before it rallied in the ninth against Aroldis Chapman, who helped the Cubs win the World Series last year for the first time since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. and Javier Baez each singled in a run before Chapman hit slumping slugger Anthony Rizzo on his left forearm with the bases loaded on his 36th pitch, forcing home the tying run.

Rizzo got an X-ray on his arm and it came back negative.

“Thank my parents I drank my milk when I was a kid,” Rizzo said. “Decent bones.”

Tyler Clippard then came in and got Ben Zobrist to bounce to second for the final out. It was Chapman’s first blown save since Game 7 at Cleveland.

“I felt normal. It just wasn’t my night tonight,” Chapman said through a translator.

Before Hicks scampered home with the winning run, the biggest highlight of extra innings belonged to Cubs slugger Kyle Schwarber. The left fielder went into the stands in foul territory for an outstanding catch on Chase Headley’s foul popup in the 12th.

“Tremendous play,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.

What was left of the crowd also sung along when the Cubs showed a tape of Harry Caray singing “Take Me Out To The Ball Game” for the second seventh-inning stretch in the 14th.

Jacoby Ellsbury hit a two-run homer for New York, and Aaron Judge had a run-scoring triple. Ellsbury went 2 for 6 in his first start since he bruised a nerve in his left elbow last Monday.

Baez homered for the Cubs, and Schwarber doubled twice. Jon Lester struck out nine in seven sharp innings in his 30th career start against New York.

Luis Severino had a similar line for New York, bouncing back nicely from a shaky start against Toronto last Monday. The right-hander allowed one run and four hits in seven innings.

Worth noting

The Yankees set franchise strikeout records for pitching with 26 and hitting with 22 Ks. The previous single-game records were 19 for pitching and 17 for batting.

Cubs: OF Jason Heyward was out of the starting lineup for the second straight day with a sore knuckle on his right hand. … LHP Brett Anderson was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a lower back strain. The Cubs also optioned LHP Rob Zastryzny to Triple-A Iowa and recalled RHP reliever Justin Grimm and INF Tommy La Stella from their top farm club.

Up next

Yankees: Masahiro Tanaka (4-1, 4.46 ERA) gets the ball Monday for the opener of a two-game set in Cincinnati. He faces fellow right-hander Rookie Davis (1-1, 7.36 ERA), who was acquired by the Reds when they traded Aroldis Chapman to the Yankees in December 2015.

Cubs: Jake Arrieta (4-1, 4.63 ERA) starts for the Cubs on Monday in the opener of a three-game series at Colorado. Right-hander Antonio Senzatela (4-1, 2.84 ERA) pitches for the Rockies.

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's second travel ban targeting immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries begins a new round of federal court hearings Monday battling a familiar Achilles' heel: Candidate Trump.

From Richmond, Va., to Seattle, Wash., federal appeals courts with a majority of judges nominated by Democratic presidents will hear government lawyers defend the revised ban against immigrants and refugees as Trump's national security prerogative.

Civil liberties and immigrants' rights groups will contend that the new executive order continues to discriminate against Muslims based on their religion, a violation of the First Amendment's establishment clause -- and they will use Trump's words from the campaign trail as Exhibit A.

It was still 2015 when Trump -- before any votes had been cast in primaries and caucuses — called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.""

More:Refugee admissions plummet under Trump

Those and subsequent comments by Trump and his associates have been used by challengers to prove that regardless of other reasons, the travel ban represents an unconstitutional violation of religious rights.

But unlike the first round of court battles in February, which sent the White House back to the drawing board to draft a new executive order, administration officials and their allies have reason to believe they are on firmer legal ground now.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The president's previous executive order on immigration was suspended by federal judges. Time

Travel ban 2.0 exempts thousands of foreign nationals who hold valid visas or green cards. It eliminates Iraq from the original list of affected countries, leaving Iran, Libya, Somalis, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It lasts for 90 days, not indefinitely, as had been the case for Syria. It contains no preference for religious minorities, which had favored Christians. And it includes a waiver process for those claiming undue hardship.

""On its face, it doesn't target Muslims,"" says Christopher Hajec, litigation director for the conservative Immigration Reform Law Institute. ""The political branches of our government have the sovereign right to protect the country.""

TRUMP V. TRUMP

(Photo: JOSHUA LOTT, AFP/Getty Images)

Challengers say targeting Muslims is exactly what the travel ban does, and they cite Trump's words as proof.

""President Trump publicly committed himself to an indefensible goal: banning Muslims from coming to the United States,"" the American Civil Liberties Union and National Immigration Law Center argue in court papers. ""The president refused to repudiate that goal on multiple occasions, including after he was elected, and he continues to advertise it to this day on his own website.""

Karen Tumlin, NILC's legal director, says that violates the Constitution's ban on government establishment of religion and gives Muslim Americans ""a constant feeling that the highest office in the land is disparaging their religious choice.""

Read more:

The government insists the impetus for both versions of the travel ban is the same: national security. Every president for the past three decades has temporarily suspended entry of some aliens, it says. Near the end of the Obama administration, it notes, immigrants from the same six nations were blocked temporarily under the visa waiver program because of concerns about terrorism.

That argument didn't work the first time around in February. A federal district court judge in Washington State and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit stopped the ban in its tracks -- after a chaotic first few days at international airports and a round of visa cancellations by the State Department.

Version 2.0 didn't fare much better in March. This time, federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland got in the way, just as the ban was about to go into effect. In Hawaii, Judge Derrick Watson cited ""significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus"" toward Muslims. In Maryland, Judge Theodore Chuang said the ""history of public statements"" indicated the purpose was ""the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban.”

Thomas Lee, an international law professor at Fordham University School of Law, says the second executive order stands a better chance of being upheld but remains burdened by the earlier anti-Muslim rhetoric.

""They can’t completely disavow the past statements,"" Lee says. ""You can't put that genie back in the bottle.""

LAST STOP: SUPREME COURT?

The government and conservative interest groups backing it say statements Trump made when he was not president are largely irrelevant. ""Even in the domestic setting, courts judge the legitimacy of a law by what it says and does, and occasionally by the official context that surrounds it — not by what supposedly lies in the hearts of its drafters,"" the government's brief says.

That may not be enough to convince the judges hearing the cases on Monday in Richmond and the following week in Seattle. Both courts are among the most liberal in the country.

The Richmond hearing will be held in front of the entire 15-member U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which is extremely unusual. Appeals court cases usually go before three-judge panels; the full court only rarely agrees to hear cases even after a panel rules.

“It’s been more than half a century since the court has done it,” Tumlin says. “It’s a bit of a legal unicorn. You don’t get this very often.”

If both the 4th and 9th Circuit appeals courts rule against Trump, he will get one final chance if the Supreme Court agrees to weigh in. The high court, now at full strength with the addition of Trump's nominee, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, has divided closely in the past on issues involving immigration.

Last June, it deadlocked 4-4 over President Barack Obama's effort to protect more than 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to seek work permits. The tie vote left a lower court ruling against the program intact.

But the justices often defer to the president and executive branch on issues involving national security.

“If I were a betting man,"" Lee says, ""I would bet that the government wins.”

Pulmonary congestion is a possible cause of Olympic bobsledder Steven Holcomb’s death on Saturday, USA Bobsled & Skeleton announced on Sunday.

The results of a preliminary report by the Adirondack Medical Center revealed the potential cause, pending toxicology performed by an independent laboratory. The preliminary report was negative for drugs, and USA Bobsled said there is no suspicion of foul play.

Holcomb, 37, was found to have died in his sleep at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid on Saturday.

More Olympics:

Holcomb won Olympic gold in 2010, piloting the “Night Train” to win the first U.S. gold medal in the four-man bobsled since 1948. In Sochi, Holcomb won bronze medals in the two-man and four-man bobsled.

""Our deepest sympathies go out to the family, friends and teammates of our dear friend Steven Holcomb,"" said USA Bobsled & Skeleton Board of Directors Chairman Pete Piechoski. ""Steve was a wonderful man, and a great friend. He was a fearless competitor whose light shone bright and guided us all. You will be sorely missed, Steve.

9,Is it even possible to enforce a lifetime stadium ban? | FOX Sports,"Last week, Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones blasted the concept of stadium bans, referring to such suspensions as a “slap on the wrist” following the team’s May 1 game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park.

According to Jones, fans at the historic ballpark taunted him with racial epithets during the Orioles’ 5-2 win, with one throwing a bag of peanuts at Jones as he made his way to the dugout.

Red Sox president Sam Kennedy told MassLive.com that 34 fans were removed from the game, including 20 who were tossed for alcohol-related reasons. It’s unclear how many of those ejected engaged in the reported abuse of Jones — or how many fans are kicked out of an average game — but the Boston Globe reported that one fan was banned for life by the stadium.

Regardless, Jones argued that neither penalty is harsh enough to end the behavior.

USA TODAY Sports/Gregory Fisher

“It’s pathetic,” Jones said, according to USA Today. “It’s called a coward. What they need to do is that instead of kicking them out of the stadium, they need to fine them 10 grand, 20 grand, 30 grand. Something that really hurts somebody. Make them pay in full. And if they don’t, take it out of their check.

“That’s how you hurt somebody,” the five-time All-Star continued. “You suspend them from the stadium, what does that mean?”

According to experts in the field, it doesn’t necessarily mean much — and while bans are usually effective, they aren’t a foolproof way to keep troublesome fans from returning, especially if they’re determined to get back in.

Different states, leagues and teams have varying policies, but typically speaking, a violator facing a stadium ban is forced to sign paperwork before leaving the building agreeing to their own prohibition. In addition, any future tickets purchased by that fan are voided, and should that person return while the ban is still in place, he or she would be subject to arrest for criminal trespass.

However, while the threat of incarceration is certainly a deterrent, enforcement can be challenging.

USA TODAY Sports/Ron Chenoy

“(Looking out for) ejected fans is a priority,” said Dan Donovan, vice president of security and technology consulting for Guidepost Solutions. “But those guards’ biggest priority is that the screening process is being done correctly and that we don’t have prohibited items coming into the facility.”

To help catch banned spectators, ballparks, stadiums and arenas will often distribute images of banned fans to security staff. But while employees remain mindful of blacklisted fans attempting to attend a game undetected, those faces can be tough to spot among the thousands who flood the building’s gates.

“Security and guest services are there to make the event enjoyable,” sports security expert James DeMeo, founder of Unified Sports & Entertainment Security Consulting, said. “But they also obviously have that duty of care to make sure the fans are safe.

“On ingress, metal (detectors) and screening measures are really important in terms of staff having that situational awareness to look for potentially troubled or dangerous fans before they come into the venue,” DeMeo added. “But the key is for the staff to know the signs to look for with a disgruntled or agitated fan.”

At the University of Southern Mississippi, students and faculty at the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security work specifically toward the goal of improving security at sporting events. Launched in 2006 on a grant from the Department of Homeland Security, the Center researches the impact of spectator-related incidents nationwide and has provided training and certification to more than 5,000 security professionals and nearly 1,000 universities.

USA TODAY Sports/Mark J. Rebilas

“We constantly look at people, processes and technologies to see if we can try to solve problems,” Lou Marciani, the Center’s director, told FOX Sports. “This incident in Boston will trigger new best practices, it will trigger new rules and regulations from the leagues, and it will drive technology to the lab here, so we can begin to, long-term, solve the problem.

“And that’s really what the center does,” Marciani added. “We’re on the back end of things to make things better down the road.”

Another approach that could take the pressure off hired personnel and help nab unwanted fans is the use of facial-recognition programs and other biometric software, but implementing that emerging technology is costly and is far from a cure-all.

“In order to do facial recognition, first of all I have to have a good, clear picture (of the subject),” Donovan said. “Then I load the picture into my system, I’ve got a database of known offenders, and certain cameras, when set up correctly, are fixed on a focus area, and you can run facial recognition off of that and flag those people.

USA TODAY Sports/David Butler II

“This isn’t Jack Bauer in ‘24’ though,” Donovan continued. “You’re not just pulling these faces off any old camera in the stadium. So it’s an investment for the stadium operator, the team, in order to add this capability for the number of doors, the possible entry points to their perimeter. And every building is different.”

With time, such systems will become more commonplace — ”I think it’s coming,” Donovan said, “and it’s going to come quickly” — but for now the onus still rests largely on the security and guest services representatives manning the building’s front line.

Fortunately for the teams and leagues that occupy these spaces, simply asking fans to leave and not come back is almost always enough to keep them away from good.

“Usually the trespass warning cures the situation,” said Ed Boyens, security manager for the City of Orlando venues division, which oversees operations at Amway Center and Camping World Stadium. “And it’s very rare that we do see somebody come back.”

Reza Parastesh, a 25-year-old who looks a lot like Messi, has embraced his doppelganger looks by growing out his beard and rocking a No. 10 Barcelona shirt. According to AFP, police took the student to the police station and impounded his car to clear up commotion he caused.

“Now people really see me as the Iranian Messi and want me to mimic everything he does,” Parastesh told AFP. When I show up somewhere, people are really shocked. I’m really happy that seeing me makes them happy and this happiness gives me a lot of energy.”

It all started with Parastesh’s father, noticing the resemblance, convinced his son to try on a Barcelona shirt to see how it looked. Parastesh seemed to think he was onto something and started growing out his beard, too.

It looks like it could turn lucrative for the lookalike — he has gotten media interviews and contract offers to model. The problem for Parastesh right now is that he can’t do any tricks with a soccer ball, but he’s working on that. If Messi is up for it, however, Parastesh is willing to help him out off the pitch.

“Being the best player in footballing history, he definitely has more work than he can handle. I could be his representative when he is too busy,” he said.

9,"Chelsea's N'Golo Kante picks up another award, named Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year | FOX Sports","N’Golo Kante has been voted Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers’ Association, just shading his Chelsea teammate Eden Hazard in the voting.

Just like the voting for last month’s Professional Footballers’ Association Player of the Year award, Kante and Hazard trotted into first and second, taking a combined 65 percent of the votes. Tottenham’s Dele Alli, the reigning PFA Young Player of the Year, finished third, some distance behind the two Chelsea men.

A record 17 different players received votes, with five players from Chelsea receiving recognition in Kante, Hazard, David Luiz, Diego Costa and Cesar Azpilicueta.

Upon receiving the award, Kante said: “It is a fantastic honor to win this award. With so many great players in this Chelsea squad and in the Premier League, for the Football Writers’ Association to name me their Footballer of the Year is a very proud moment in my career.”

FWA Chairman Patrick Barclay added: “N’Golo Kante could not be a more deserving winner of English football’s most prestigious individual award.

“In the view of some FWA members, he would have been a worthy recipient last season for his contribution to Leicester’s title success, but the almost unbroken excellent form of Chelsea since he changed clubs has left little room for further debate.

“Considering the competition of Eden Hazard and other players from Chelsea in particular, this is a great achievement.”

In 69 years, Kante is just the fourth Chelsea player to be voted FWA Footballer of the Year, alongside Gianfranco Zola in 1997, Frank Lampard in 2005 and Hazard in 2015. Kante is the last Frenchman to win the award since Arsenal’s legendary striker Thierry Henry won it back in 2006.",fox-sports
9,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles coming back to Chicagoland | FOX Sports,"The Heroes in a Half Shell are headed back to Chicagoland Speedway and the opening race of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series playoff season.

The Sept. 17 Cup race at Chicagoland will be dubbed the Tales of the Turtles 400 and it will kick off NASCAR’s 10-race, season-ending playoffs.

The return engagement means fans will see a lot of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-themed activities on race weekend, including a fan meet-and-greet with the Turtles and a ticket package that includes a Tales of the Turtles DVD.

In an exclusive interview with FOXSports.com, track president Scott Paddock said he was pleased that Nickelodeon agreed to bring the Turtles franchise back for a second season after a successful partnership last season when the race was called the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 400.

“We’re thrilled because media companies like Nickelodeon are very activation-savvy,” Paddock told FOXSports.com. “They’re very promotional oriented. So when you have an entitlement partner like that allocates a lot of resources on promoting your event and secondly, doing a lot on-site that really enhances the guest experience, that’s a huge benefit from our end.”

Paddock said that in addition to having the Turtles at the track, he expects Nickelodeon to bring other on-air talents to the facility. There’s also Turtle-themed NASCAR merchandise already available through the NASCAR.com superstore.

Last year, eight vehicles in NASCAR’s top-three divisions carried special Turtles paint schemes during the Chicagoland weekend and Paddock expects this year will produce another eight to 10 special paint schemes.

Being the first race of the NASCAR playoffs helps, and so does the location.

“It differentiates us in terms of the 36-race schedule,” Paddock said of the track’s race date.

“I think the (NASCAR) industry loves coming to Chicago,” said Paddock. “So I think that’s been a boon. And as I like to say, big events become even bigger in a market like Chicago.”

And since it is the first playoff race, having NASCAR’s support helps, too.

“NASCAR has recognized that a good, successful kickoff to the playoffs typically has a healthy halo effect on the remaining nine races,” said Paddock. “So they have tended to invest resources in Chicago for a successful kickoff. We and are partners have benefitted from that as well.”

9,"Raptors All-Star Kyle Lowry says he'll opt out of contract, become a free agent | FOX Sports","One day after the Toronto Raptors’ season ended with a four-game sweep against the Cleveland Cavaliers, All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry confirmed to reporters Monday that he will opt out of his contract and become a free agent this summer.

Expected as it was, Kyle Lowry made it official this AM in Toronto, telling local reporters: ""I will be opting out"" to become a free agent — Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) May 8, 2017

The decision isn’t a surprise given that Lowry, 31, has been an All-Star three times since he re-upped with Toronto for three years with an option for a fourth in 2014. He was set to be paid $12 million for each year of that contract, and it’s possible that he could get a max deal from the Raptors or another team after opting out.

Lowry averaged a career-high 22.4 points and 4.8 rebounds to go along with 7.0 assists for a Raptors team that finished third in the East with a 51-31 record. He missed Games 3 and 4 against the Cavaliers with a sprained ankle and now must decide whether he wants to continue to fall short against Cleveland in the NBA playoffs or take his chances with another team. The Cavs have eliminated the Raptors each of the past two years, and this year the series wasn’t even close.",fox-sports
9,Snake on the field causes delay during minor-league game | FOX Sports,"A snake slithered its way on to the field during Sunday’s Triple-A meeting between the Reno Aces and Sacramento River Cats, resulting in a bizarre, yet comical game delay.

The unwanted visitor was discovered in the third inning, when Aces shortstop Jack Reinheimer noticed the snake near second base and brought it to the umpire’s attention.

The grounds crew was called on to the field — while Whitesnake played on the PA system — and promptly scooped up the scaly pest, which turned out to be an innocent garden snake.

Reinheimer said he wasn’t sure what to do when he spotted the snake, so he consulted the first-base umpire.

“I don’t know if we’re supposed to try and pick it up and get it off the field,” Reinheimer told MiLB.com, “But I’m not laying out for a ball if it’s right there.”

The River Cats’ social media account sarcastically cried foul on the incident, insinuating that the snake was used as a scare tactic by the Aces, who happen to be the minor-league affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Dunno, looks like a diamondback to us. @Aces @Dbacks #SnakeGate2017 pic.twitter.com/r025fTKLqu — River Cats (@RiverCats) May 7, 2017

The Aces wound up coming back from a four-run deficit, scoring five runs in the eighth to go on and win the game, 6-5. Looks like the minor-leagues just found its first rally snake.

9,Ricky Stenhouse Jr.'s dad ends up in custody en route to Victory Lane at Talladega | FOX Sports,"Ricky Stenhouse Jr. had all of his closest family and friends waiting for him in Victory Lane to celebrate his first career win in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series on Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway.

That is, everyone except his father, Ricky Stenhouse Sr.

Stenhouse Sr. watched his son pass Kyle Busch for the lead and hold him off for the victory from his motorhome, which was located behind the Alabama Gang Superstretch of the 2.66-mile track.

When Stenhouse Jr. crossed the finish line, Stenhouse Sr. wanted to get to his son so bad, he tried climbing the backstretch fence when he realized there was no way to get across the track.

That’s when all the trouble started, which was best described by Talladega Superspeedway public relations director, Russell Branham, who quickly chimed in and explained the entire situation during the winner’s press conference in the media center.

“He (Stenhouse Sr.) was extremely excited about his son winning today, and naturally so, Branham said. “His son wins the race, he goes down, he tries to find a way to get across the track. He tried to climb the fence, found out he couldn’t. He begins running down outside of the perimeter road of Turn 3 outside the venue. He wants to go through the tunnel and get in here. Our guys saw it, naturally they stopped him, asked him who he was, said would you get in the car.”

“They placed him in the car and talked to him,” he added. “They said, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘I’m Ricky Stenhouse’s father.’ (Security then said) Hold on one second, sir. Let me call the director of security. (They) called our security, and our security guy said, ‘Take him to Victory Lane, and that’s what happened.’”

This isn’t the first time Stenhouse Sr. has climbed the fence at a NASCAR track. After Stenhouse Jr.’s first ARCA Series win at Kentucky Speedway in 2008, the two climbed the backstretch fence to meet up and celebrate.

“My dad has done so much for me in my career,” Stenhouse Jr. said. “Making sure that you have the right people around you is one of the things that he’s all about — making sure that you have people that respect you, that will do anything for you, and man, he sacrificed a lot for me and my career.”

With his first career victory, Stenhouse Jr. is now eligible to automatically compete in this year’s NASCAR All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway on May 20.

Stenhouse Jr. credits his father for helping him achieve his racing dreams.

“Everything that I know about racing I learned from him,” Stenhouse Jr. said. “I’m glad that he was able to be here in Victory Lane.”

6,Sally Yates warned White House that Michael Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail,"Sally Yates speaks during a press conference at the Department of Justice on June 28, 2016. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said Monday that she was so concerned that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn may have misled Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with the Russian ambassador that she met twice with the White House counsel – including a discussion at one point about possible about criminal charges.

For the first time publicly, Yates recounted to a Senate panel a Jan. 26 meeting – and a follow up meeting the next day – in which she alerted White House Counsel Don McGahn that Flynn had lied to administration officials about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump's inauguration. Those misrepresentations, Yates would maintain, made the former Army lieutenant general vulnerable to possible blackmail.

""You don’t want a situation where a national security adviser could get blackmailed by the Russians,’’ Yates told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.

The specter of Yates' testimony was not lost on Trump, who early Monday fired off two tweets distancing the administration from Flynn while suggesting that Yates may have leaked information about her actions related to the former national security adviser.

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,'' Trump said. ""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council (sic).''

Trump and Obama administration officials also confirmed Monday that Obama advised Trump not to hire Flynn during their post-election White House meeting.

What remains troubling about Flynn's contacts, according to officials who have previously described the communications, was that the former general had talked with the ambassador about sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. Those conversations were secretly monitored by federal authorities, as are most communications involving foreign diplomats.

Pence, meanwhile, had said he had been assured by Flynn that the subject of sanctions was not raised in the Kislyak conversations.

Shortly after Yates' warnings were made public, Flynn was forced to resign, ending the shortest tenure of any president's national security adviser – while stoking further suspicion about the ties between Trump associates and Russian officials.

Since then, Flynn and former Trump advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone have become the subjects of fresh scrutiny about their Russian ties.

On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that Trump transition team members had warned Flynn about the risks of communicating with the Russian ambassador, prior to the his December telephone conversations with Kislyak. According to the report, Flynn was told in November that the ambassador's communications were likely being monitored by U.S. authorities.

Separately, the Senate Intelligence Committee, which along with the House Intelligence Committee are conducting a parallel inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, recently asked the advisers to provide information about their activities.

Flynn also is now under investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General for failing to inform Defense Department officials about seeking payments from foreign governments.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is leading Monday's Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing, has said the panel's examination is necessary to ""hold [Russia] accountable.''

""Based on evidence presented by our intelligence and law enforcement communities, I believe Russia interfered in our election,'' Graham has said. ""I do not believe it changed the outcome, but I have no doubt they interfered.'' The U.S. intelligence community has accused Moscow of orchestrating a campaign of cyberattacks to hack Democratic political organizations and release stolen information to undermine confidence in the American election.

It is not immediately clear how much new information Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also is scheduled to testify Monday, will be able provide. Both witnesses are likely to be constrained by the classified nature of the information surrounding the events they were privy to.

In March, when Yates' attorney had notified the Justice Department and White House of her intent to appear at a previously scheduled House Intelligence Committee hearing, the attorney was warned that Yates' testimony could contained privileged communications that might be barred.

Ultimately, Yates' scheduled March 28 appearance was canceled.

Trump spokesman Sean Spicer has since indicated that the White House has no objection to Yates' testifying. And last week , Graham signaled that senators will ask Yates about what other possible considerations drove her to alert the White House counsel about her concerns for Flynn.

Responding to a series of questions from Graham, FBI Director James Comey recalled in separate testimony last Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he met with Yates to discuss her concerns about Flynn's activities. The meeting occurred after FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

Comey declined to elaborate on the meeting with Yates in the open committee session.

Attorneys for Yates and Flynn did not respond to inquiries seeking comment.

Flynn, meanwhile, has sought immunity from any possible prosecution. Both the House and Senate Intelligence committees, in the midst of continuing Russia probes, have indicated that it is too early in their investigations to cut a deal for Flynn's testimony. Separately, preliminary discussions about Flynn's prospects for immunity in the FBI investigation also have yielded no agreement.

President Trump will soon have his younger and less visible daughter, Tiffany Trump, close by in Washington. She's been admitted to Georgetown Law, located just blocks from the White House.

Tiffany Trump, 23, the daughter of the president and his second wife, Marla Maples, will start at the law school of Georgetown University in the fall, confirmed Mimi Koumanelis, a spokeswoman for the Catholic university.

The main campus is in the Georgetown section of Washington, west of the White House, but the law school is about 15 blocks east of the White House.

Tiffany's presence in Washington will put three of the Trump children (and three grandchildren) in the capital by the fall: Older half-sister Ivanka Trump and her family are living there; she and her husband, Jared Kushner, are senior advisers to the president.

Trump's youngest child, Barron, 11, son of his third wife, first lady Melania Trump, will be moving to Washington with her sometime in June after the end of his school year. The president recently told Bloomberg they had found a school for the youngster but didn't say which one.

The president's two older sons, from his first marriage to Ivana Trump, Donald Jr. and Eric, remain in New York where they are running the Trump real-estate empire.

Tiffany, born in Palm Beach, Fla., but raised mostly in California with her mother, is a 2016 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, from which Ivanka Trump, 35, graduated after transferring there from Georgetown University. Eric Trump also is a graduate of Georgetown University.

The younger Trump daughter was less visible in 2016 until relatively late in the campaign, mostly because she was still an undergrad. After the election, she attended the inauguration, has been seen at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, and turned up for the fun during the White House Easter Egg Roll on April 17, with her boyfriend, Ross Mechanic.

Most recently, the young couple attended a Trump dinner Thursday on the USS Intrepid, docked on the Hudson River in New York, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the World War II Battle of Coral Sea with the prime minister of Australia.

She and Maples and Mechanic also were spotted during New York Fashion Week in February, in the front row for the Fall/Winter 2017 show of Chinese designer Taoray Wang, who designed her white dress and matching coat for Inauguration Day.

A representative of the Trump Organization has not yet responded to a request for comment from USA TODAY.

Tropical Cyclone Donna, packing 120-mph winds, is bearing down on the French territory of New Caledonia in the south Pacific.

On Sunday, as its winds soared to 130 mph, Donna became the most powerful tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere in the month of May, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach.

As of midday Monday U.S. time, the storm was the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale and was moving to the southeast at 9 mph. Tropical cyclones are the same types of storms as hurricanes or typhoons.

By Tuesday into Wednesday, local time, the center of Donna should pass near New Caledonia, bringing flooding rain, possible landslides, coastal flooding and damaging winds, the Weather Channel warned.

Schools in New Caledonia were closed for a public holiday on Monday and would stay shut on Tuesday, Reuters said.

New Caledonia is more than 1,000 miles east of Australia.

Late last week, Donna downed trees and destroyed a church and many homes as it barreled through Vanuatu's far northern province of Torba, World Vision reported.

Donna will never again be the name of a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean as it was retired from use following Hurricane Donna's violent rampage up the U.S. East Coast in 1960.

Storms in oceans and seas around the world all use separate lists of names.

WASHINGTON – Former President Obama warned his successor Donald Trump against hiring Michael Flynn as national security adviser because of his ties to Russian officials, officials in both camps said Monday.

The warning came just two days after the presidential election, during the incoming president's meeting with Obama in the Oval Office on Nov. 10.

Despite Obama's warnings, Trump appointed Flynn as national security adviser anyway – and dismissed him less than a month into his presidency, saying that Flynn misled the White House about his conversations with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump's inauguration.

Though he did not comment in detail about the Oval Office meeting, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Obama made it clear that ""he wasn’t exactly a fan of Gen. Flynn’s.""

That ""shouldn't come as a surprise,"" Spicer said, noting the outgoing president had fired Flynn as the head of the military's intelligence unit. If Obama was so concerned, he should have suspended Flynn's security clearance when he had the authority to do so, Spicer added.

A former aide to President Obama also confirmed the warning, first reported by NBC News.

Another Trump official who confirmed the warning also requested anonymity in order to discuss the private conversation between Obama and Trump, and because of the sensitivity of discussing Flynn, currently the subject of ongoing federal investigations over his contacts with Russians.

During the November meeting, that official said, Obama seemed aware of Flynn's contacts with the Russians, including a 2015 trip to Moscow.

For his part, Trump has defended Flynn and questioned why the Obama administration allowed the former Army lieutenant general to have a security clearance.

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,"" Trump tweeted Monday.

The news of Obama's warnings broke shortly before ex-Justice Department official Sally Yates is expected to testify before a Senate panel about her own warnings that Flynn had lied to administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

Flynn, who spoke with Kislyak before Trump took office, initially denied talking with the ambassador about sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia over its efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Flynn later acknowledged that the subject may have surfaced in a phone conversation.

Last month, FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau was investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials during the election.

Flynn, whose conversations with the ambassador fueled suspicion about inappropriate contact between the Trump team and Russia, is also under investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General for failing to inform the Defense Department about accepting payments from foreign governments without the required prior approval. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, declined to comment.

On Monday, Spicer said Trump stands by his decisions to hire Flynn and then later to dismiss him.

Though he didn’t mention him by name, much of former President Barack Obama’s speech when he accepted a Profile in Courage Award at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library on Sunday evening seemed aimed at President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress who are attempting to dismantle Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. Here of some of his more biting quotes, most of which appear directed at Trump as well as in defense of Obamacare:

***

About members of Congress who voted to pass the ACA during his presidency, only to lose their seat in later elections.

“They had a chance to insure millions. But this vote could also cost them their seats, perhaps end their political careers. … These men and women did the right thing. They did the hard thing. … Their desire to retain a reputation for integrity was stronger than a desire to remain in office.”

***

About today’s members of Congress:

“It is my fervent hope and the hope of millions ... [that] such courage is still possible, that today’s members of Congress, regardless of party, are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth, even when it contradicts party positions.”

***

Describing those in a Boston cancer ward (before the ACA), as told to him by Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose son Ted Jr. was being treated there:

“These parents lived in constant fear of what might happen if they could not afford the next treatment, some calculating in their own minds what they might have to sell or borrow just to make it for a few more months. Some bargaining with God for whatever they could get.”

***

About leadership:

“Any fool can be fearless. Courage, true courage, derives from that senses that of who we are. What are our best selves? What are our most important commitments?”

“It doesn’t take a whole load of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. But it does require courage to champion the vulnerable, and the sick, and the infirm. Those who have no access to the corridors of power.”

“That very Kennedy-esque idea that America is not the project of only one person but that each of us can make a difference and all of us ought to try.”

***

On immigrants and immigration:

I think of … every American who stands up for immigrants because they know that their parents or grandparents or great-grandparents were immigrants too. And they know that America is an idea that only grows stronger with each person who adopts our common creed.”

***

About diversity and tolerance:

“Everywhere we see the risk of falling into the refuge of tribe, clan and anger at those who don’t look like us, have the same surnames or pray the way we do. … At such moments we need courage to stand up to hate, not just in others but within ourselves. At such moments we need the courage to stand up to dogma, not just in others but within ourselves.”

16,5 things to know about the new 'King Arthur' starring Charlie Hunnam,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Charlie Hunnam had a few surprises while filming 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword' and 'The Lost City of Z.' He shares his behind-the-scenes stories with USA TODAY's Andrea Mandell. Dan MacMedan for USA TODAY

Charlie Hunnam claims Arthur's birthright in 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.' (Photo: Daniel Smith, Warner Bros.)

There’s a new king carrying Excalibur’s sword. This weekend, Charlie Hunnam will be crowned in King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (in theaters Friday), a new take on the Merlin legend from director Guy Ritchie.

Five things you need to know about the big-budget spectacle:

This is an origin story.

In the supernatural-infused reboot, Arthur’s father (Eric Bana) is wrestled from his throne by his murderous brother Vortigern (Jude Law). Young Arthur escapes and is raised as an orphan in a brothel, where he takes up the life of a thief. A decade later, thanks to Vortigern's paranoid edict forcing all young men in the kingdom be tested on their ability to wrest the sword from the stone, Arthur's birthright proves hard to avoid. “One of the big problems with the Arthurian legend is it’s so sprawling,” says Hunnam, 37. “So what Guy had wanted to do, very smartly, was just tell the first chapter of the story.”

Charlie Hunnam is equipped for mega-fame, says director Guy Ritchie. (Photo: Chris Young, AP)

Charlie Hunnam has been ready for years.

The British actor launched his 2017 silver-screen offensive last month with The Lost City of Z, rose to fame as a dangerous biker on Sons of Anarchy and infamously pulled out as the lead in Fifty Shades of Grey. He moved to Hollywood 20 years ago to launch his career. “It’s not like he’s new to any of this,” says Ritchie, adding that he’s “seldom met anyone as level-headed as (Charlie). ... Any degree of fame is not going to corrupt him. He’s pretty solid.”

Um, he’s really, really ripped in the role.

Let’s just say Hunnam didn’t have much work to do to get in shape for King Arthur. “He never seems to carry more than 6% body fat,” says Ritchie with mock annoyance. Hunnam’s routine? “I did some Thai boxing, Jiu-Jitsu,” he told Kristen Bell when she filled in on Jimmy Kimmel Live! last week. “I set myself a goal of doing 1,000 push-ups a day minimum for six months. I’m a little bit crazy so if there was a day that I didn’t get the thousand, I would punish myself and have to do 2,000 the next day. You've got to get after it. Eye of the tiger!”

More 'Arthur' could be on the way.

Hunnam has signed on for more installments, should the box office be fruitful. Is he up for it? “Absolutely,” he says. ""I grew up on (1981's) Excalibur. I must have watched it four dozen times. It’s one of the great stories. I would hope (future movies) would be with Guy. That’s always the roll of the dice for an actor who signs on to these type of things.""

Yes, that’s David Beckham with the bad teeth.

Look closely: Beckham has a cameo as a soldier watching as Hunnam attempts to pull Excalibur from its stubborn resting place. How could you miss him? Well, Ritchie decorated his famous friend in a prosthetic nose, facial scars and rotted teeth. “I sat next to him as he was watching his bit, and I could feel him shrinking in his chair,"" says Ritchie with a laugh, who last hired Beckham to appear as a movie projectionist in 2015’s The Man From U.N.C.L.E. “He’s the most wonderful man."" For the record, Beckham was cool with masking his famous visage. ""That’s the only way it can work,"" Ritchie says. ""If there’s too much good-looking Beckham going on, he could distract you.""

Michelle Rosoff said the school didn't need therapists on hand in the middle of a graduation. ""I'm a therapist, that's what I do for a living. If they need therapists, I'll bring a whole shitload of therapists,"" she said.

In an email to BuzzFeed News, Lisa Luten, a spokeswoman for Wake County Schools, said that the decision not to have a memorial for Rachel during graduation was made by administration officials, counseling staff, and school psychologists ""based on guidelines recommended by National Association of School Psychologists.""

However, some of Rachel's friends want her to be remembered at their graduation ceremony.

""I think we are old enough to be okay and understand what is going on,"" Alissa Brasington, Rachel's friend, told WRAL.com. ""I think we'll be okay if they mention her. It will actually be better than if they don't mention her.""

Her best friend, Victoria Ward, who is graduating in June, told ABC 11, ""I think it's more of a sad thing that they can't recognize her. She should be there with us.""

Luten said that ""Rachel will be remembered and recognized during Enloe High School's Senior Awards event. A scholarship will be presented in her name at that event.""

Students and teachers had also installed a bench on campus in Rachel's honor.

Michelle Rosoff told BuzzFeed News that she had started the $500 scholarship in Rachel's name. A link to the scholarship is on the school's website.

4,17 Poop Emergencies That Will Make You Laugh And Cringe,"We asked members of the BuzzFeed Community to tell us their grossest, funniest vacation poop stories. Here are some of our favorites.

1. The beach bum poop: ""Two years ago I went to Hawaii for the first time with my now fiancé. On our first day there, I caught traveler's diarrhea. So every item I ate, I pooped out shortly after. Not thinking it was a big deal, but already having an unpleasant experience, we went into the ocean. I felt a rumble in my tummy but ignored it, figuring it was just gas. A wave came and knocked us both over, rolling me around a little. I was still on the sand but slightly submerged, and as I was rolling around trying to upright myself I crapped my bathing suit. I waddled back up to the beach trying to hold remaining poop in. I told my significant other that I crapped my pants and we rushed back to the room, where we found the inside of my bathing suit covered in poop and sand."" —zhis616

2. The trashcan poop: ""My mom and I were in Kentucky for my older brother's soccer tournament. We were out during the day, and came back to the room running down the halls because both of us had to poop so bad. Being younger, I naturally got to the toilet first. But my mom couldn't hold it. So she came into the bathroom with me, grabbed the trashcan, and proceeded to shit in the trashcan while crying with laughter and telling me how much of a bad daughter I was. To this day, anytime she tries to judge me, I just remind her of the time she shit in a hotel bathroom trashcan."" —allycoop

3. The just-married poop: ""My husband and I were heading out for our honeymoon; we were talking and having a good time. I thought I had to fart, but instead, a whole intestine's worth of diarrhea came out. I was wearing these thin leggings and it seeped out onto our new car seats. I tried sitting sideways so that I wouldn't get them messed up, but the poop started running down my butt cheek. After driving for 10-15 minutes, with my husband laughing and me being all squishy, we pulled into a sketchy-looking car wash that had cameras up everywhere. I got baby wipes and went to the backseat, butt in the air, spreading my cheeks so that I could wipe, despite the cameras. My husband, you ask, was outside with my leggings. He had hung them up on the mat cleaners, spraying yellow poop all over the place...I love him."" —ashurhunter

4. The mountain-of-poop poop: ""We were in Nepal hiking the Himalayas and had to use squatty potties — the same ones the villagers used. One particular squatty was especially ripe, and by this point, our entire group's stomachs had all given up on life. Of course, no one heeded the warnings not to throw toilet paper in the hole, so we all did. By the time I was able to use it, the poop was literally flowing over the top, so we were pooping on top of poop in this horrific vicious cycle. By this point, we began to take all our toilet paper with us, filling this one, lone plastic shopping bag. Let's not even discuss the smell."" —kfl17

5. The you-thought-you-were-safe poop: ""On my first cruise I made it the entire time without getting sea sick. On the last night, I was feeling pretty good and wanted to loosen up for games and karaoke, so I had a few drinks. I assume that's what caused the events of the following morning. I woke up at 6 a.m. and bolted to the bathroom having to make a choice: What's going in the toilet? I had diarrhea AND I had to vomit. I opted to sit on the toilet as that seemed to be slightly more urgent. But midway into the first round, it was time to vomit. The sink was just within reach if I leaned, so I put the left corner of my mouth on the ledge and let it go. It's the sickest I've been in my life. I sat there for 35 minutes, continuously squirting poop and puking. Every convulsion of my stomach sent more out both ends simultaneously."" —Anonymous

6. The never-trust-a-fart poop: ""I went to Vegas with a buddy of mine with the intention of doing a shit-ton of hiking. It was halfway through the trip and we were about to head to our biggest hike, The Grand Canyon. As we were walking through one of the casinos, my stomach started to grumble and scream and do cartwheels. So, I'm thinking I need to just fart and, well, a fart ends up being much more — I shit my pants. So, I run to the bathroom while yelling at my friend, ""shit, shit, shit, shit,"" and I just throw my boxers in the trashcan. I free-ball it back to the hotel and get another pair of boxers. Then, while we're waiting on the bus, getting ready to head out, I once again decided to trust a fart, and tah-dahhh.... I ended up hiking the Grand Canyon free-ballin' again. Lesson learned: Never trust a fart."" —corypayton

7. The illegal poop: ""Three years ago, I went on a long-haul hiking trip to Nepal with my brother and dad. We were in India just before we travelled on to Kathmandu and it was my 20th birthday so, to celebrate, I enjoyed a delicious margarita at a bar in Delhi. Flash forward two days, and we are staying in Kathmandu to meet the rest of our hiking group and get ready to set out for the Annapurna Circuit. My stomach had been rumbling for about 24 hours, but nothing of note had happened, so I was feeling good and excited. The morning before we left, I was bathroom-locked with unbelievable stomach pains, but the toilet had nothing to show for it. Later that night, once we had checked into our hotel, all hell broke loose. I was up for hours vomiting and shitting my guts out. I had to throw away three pairs of underwear because the shit kept on flowing, even in my slumber. As we had already paid for this trip and weren't going to turn around to get me medical attention, I hit the trail in a makeshift toilet paper diaper — it was no match for the miles I was hiking and quickly disintegrated. The best part: relieving oneself in nature on the trail is STRICTLY illegal, so I spent the first full day on the trail literally pooping my shorts to avoid certain arrest for desecrating the sacred trail."" —maggievoelzke

8. The roadside poop: ""It was a hot summer day, and we were stuck in stand-still traffic on our way home from a trip. Our 6-week-old daughter needed a diaper change, so we pulled off to the side of the road. Her diaper was just wet, so I decided to try and change her real quick in my lap. BIG MISTAKE. As soon as I took off her diaper, she started pooping what looked like thick mustard EVERYWHERE. My husband was scrambling to pass me wipes, and while I waited, I had no choice but to catch the mustard poop with my bare hands! MY BARE HANDS PEOPLE. We both were cleaned up eventually, but that feeling of warm sticky poo between my fingers is one I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy."" —juneburgs

She ended up standing up in the van while my grandma held a plastic bag up to her butt to have diarrhea in it.

All the French cheese we had with every meal had been making me particularly gassy, so after we walked out of the opera, I thought the loud traffic and open air would be a good opportunity to let it out. Long story short, it wasn't only a fart. I didn't say anything, and figured the next event for the day wouldn't take long. Instead, my dad ended up dragging us on a six-mile walk, uphill, all the way to Sacre Cour. I walked six miles uphill to the highest point in Paris with shit in my pants."" —emmyj4d30548d4

13. The silver lining poop: ""I went on a school trip to Peru with about 20 other people. Everything was going fine the first couple of days, but after eating chicken one night, it all went downhill. It was like a chain reaction; once one person got diarrhea, another followed. Only two out of the 21 people on the trip did not get a case of explosive diarrhea — even the chaperones were sick. This trip required many hours on a bus with one small bathroom, which soon became a problem and people started getting bags out in case they could not make it to the bathroom. We made multiple emergency stops along the way, but no place had a bathroom big enough for 21 people. Students even started carrying around their own toilet paper because the rolls kept running out. Eventually a doctor visited our hotel and gave us all medication to stop these explosions. On the bright side, the medication made our pee glow in the dark and it was pretty cool."" —cait16

So I popped a bottle of sparkling cider before heading out to dinner. I enjoyed the stroll to the restaurant, and had a good meal. But as I was getting ready to settle my tab I felt an urge in my bowels. I was totally afraid of pooping in public so I quickly paid my bill and left to begin the quick journey home. As I walked, the urge got stronger and stronger. Remember the scene in Up In Smoke when Cheech has to poo and keeps repeating to himself, 'Buttcheeks stay together...buttcheeks stay together?' That was me. Finally I was about 30 feet from my grandma's apartment, concentrating so hard on keeping it in, when my body just couldn't hold it anymore. I shat myself. The worst part?

It worked, but I forgot that coffee is like the atomic bomb of laxatives to my intestines and will literally flush me out like an apocalyptic tsunami.

When I got to the toilet there was a giant spider web and black crust growing on the toilets so I squatted over it. I walked out of the stall relieved that I had made it to the restroom and expelled the entire contents of my stomach. As I was washing my hands, my mom pointed out the giant poop stain on my shorts, and that's when I walked back to the stall and realized that my 'effective squatting' had actually failed. I'd missed most of the toilet, which meant it was all over the toilet, the floor, and the toilet paper holder. My mom helped me clean the mess all over my shorts and all over that crusty rest stop.

9,This is Serena Williams' last week at No. 1. Will she ever get back? | FOX Sports,"Serena Williams topped the WTA rankings released Monday, her third-straight week as No. 1 in absentia and 10th overall following her Australian Open victory, which was her last match before announcing her pregnancy. It'll also likely be Serena's final week atop the sport, 15 years after her debut at No. 1. When the new rankings hit next week, she'll drop to No. 2, flip-flopping again with Angelique Kerber, who first took the No. 1 spot from Serena back in September before the odd mathematics of the rankings formula saw them flip back-and-forth five times.

With her point totals continuing to drop for every tournament she misses, Serena will slide farther and farther down the rankings until she becomes unranked after the 2018 Australian Open (if she doesn't return before then). Right now, Serena is third on the all-time list of weeks at No. 1 with 319. That puts her only behind Steffi Graf (377, 58 weeks ahead) and Martina Navratilova (332, 13 weeks ahead). The tennis world fully expects Serena Williams to compete for Grand Slams upon her return. Any rational observer would probably put the over/under on post-pregnancy majors at 2.5 and that might even be too low. But what about No. 1? Will this be the last time we ever see Serena Williams' name officially atop the sport she's dominated for almost two decades?

I don't see why it has to be. Though I wouldn't necessarily bet on it, the possibility of a No. 1 return is far more realistic than the following scenario - ""36-year-old returns after pregnancy seeking a No. 1 ranking that nobody besides her has ever reached while over the age of 30"" - might suggest.

6,Sally Yates: Trump aide told Flynn blackmail risk,"(CNN) Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said Monday that she alerted the White House earlier this year that former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn could be ""essentially blackmailed by the Russians.""

""We believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,"" Yates told a Senate judiciary subcommittee, in a high-profile hearing on Russian meddling into the US election.

Yates told the panel that she had a meeting with White House Counsel Donald McGahn on January 26 to tell him that she had information that statements by Vice President Mike Pence, based on his conversations with Flynn, were false. She was joined in the meeting by a senior career official in the Justice Department.

""We weren't the only ones that knew all of this, that the Russians also knew about what General Flynn had done and the Russians also knew that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others,"" Yates said, relating the contents of her conversation with McGahn.

Yates was speaking at a hearing led by Sen. Lindsey Graham, who opened the hearing with an implicit rebuke of the President and his alternative explanations for the interference in the election.

The South Carolina Republican said the hacking was not the work of ""some 400-pound guy sitting on a bed or any other country,"" a reference to a comment Trump has previously made on the matter.

Trump fired Flynn, a retired general, for failing to disclose discussions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak about US sanctions against the Kremlin and for not telling the truth about them to Vice President Mike Pence. Yates did not say specifically that her concerns about Flynn's behavior was related to these calls, but she appeared to be implying that was the case.

In her opening statement, Yates said that she planned to be as ""fulsome and comprehensive as possible"" within ethical and legal boundaries.

Yates also warned in her opening testimony that there were some issues she could not address publicly because they involved classified information. Similarly, she said that as a former official she was not authorized to discuss Department of Justice or other executive branch deliberations. It was not immediately clear how those constraints would affect her testimony on the Flynn question. Neither Flynn nor Trump were directly referenced in her opening statement.

""The efforts by a foreign adversary to interfere and undermine our democratic processes — and those of our allies — pose a serious threat to all Americans,"" Yates said.

Graham asked Yates whether she had any information about whether there was collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia.

""My answer to that question would require me to reveal classified information,"" Yates said.

At one point in the hearing Graham asked both Clapper and Yates how information about Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador, that eventually led to his sacking, made it into the newspapers. Trump asked a similar question earlier on Twitter. Both former official said they did not know how that happened.

Trump went on the offensive on Twitter Monday morning, hours before the hearing began, blaming the Obama administration for Flynn's security clearance and asking the committee to question Yates over leaking classified information to the media.

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,"" Trump wrote , adding later , ""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council.""

A White House official told CNN that the administration plans to rebut Yates by employing two strategies: Calling into question her objectivity by arguing she is a partisan Democrat and questioning the timeline of events she is expected to present.

The Senate judiciary committee's crime and terrorism subcommittee also heard from former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who spoke in advance of Yates. He testified that he did not know about the FBI investigation into Russian meddling in the election and whether there were any links to the Trump campaign until its existence was announced in a congressional hearing by FBI Director James Comey in March.

""During my tenure as DNI, it was my practice to defer to the FBI director -- both (former FBI) Director (Robert) Mueller and Director Comey -- on whether, when, and to what extent they would inform me about such investigations,"" Clapper said.

Clapper issued a clarion call for vigilance over Russian election interference before it further eroded US democracy.

""They must be congratulating themselves for having exceeded their wildest expectations,"" he said. ""They are now emboldened to continue such activities in the future, both here and around the world, and to do so even more intensely.""

Graham, the leader of Monday's hearing, also invited former President Barack Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, to testify with Yates and Clapper, but she rejected the invitation through her lawyer, noting the last-minute timing of the invitation. A source familiar with Rice's discussions told CNN that when Graham invited her, Rice believed it was a bipartisan overture and was prepared to accept. However, ranking Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse indicated to her that the invitation was made without his agreement, as he believed her presence was not relevant to the topic of the hearing, according to the source.

Of the four former Trump campaign aides at the center of the Capitol Hill's Russia probes -- including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former foreign policy adviser Carter Page and former campaign adviser Roger Stone -- Flynn has generated the most heat following a steady stream of revelations.

Investigators on the House oversight committee raised the possibility last month that Flynn may have broken the law by not disclosing payments from RT-TV, widely considered by US officials to be a propaganda arm of the Russian government, on his 2016 national security clearance form. Flynn's lawyer at the time argued that Flynn had been open about his speech to RT-TV, including briefing the Defense Intelligence Agency on his trip.

Yates' appearance itself had been fraught with drama ever since House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes' delayed her House hearing at the last minute, as part of a chaotic three-week stretch that saw the House Russia investigation almost fall apart and Nunes become the subject of a House ethics probe.

The Washington Post reported at the time that the White House had blocked Yates by asserting executive privilege, which allows the President to stop a former aide from testifying. White House press secretary Sean Spicer vehemently denied the reports at the time and said that the White House actively supports Yates' testifying in public.

A White House official said last week that the administration still wants Yates to testify in public and reaffirmed Spicer's comments. Graham and Whitehouse also said they heard of no effort to stop her from coming before them.

Still, Democrats on the House Russia investigation are anxiously watching Monday's hearing: First, to see if Yates shows up and, second, to see how much she reveals publicly.

3,Germany searches all military barracks for Nazi material,"German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, center, speaks with Inspector General of the German armed forces Bundeswehr Volker Wieker, right, and Inspector Heer General Joerg Vollmeer, left, during a visit at military facilities on May 3, 2017 in France. (Photo: Frederick Florin, AFP/Getty Images)

BERLIN — Germany ordered searches of all army barracks for Nazi memorabilia after finding startling pieces amid growing suspicion of extremism within the military.

Two discoveries over the weekend could lead to more Nazi material being found during the searches that will end May 16, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said.

""More will be revealed, that goes without question. I'm giving everyone fair warning that we will not back down,"" Von der Leyen said Sunday on the political talk show Anne Will. ""We're not through the worst just yet.""

Authorities on Saturday discovered a cabinet displaying helmets worn by the Nazi Wehrmacht, the armed forces that served Adolf Hitler, and other memorabilia in a barrack in the city of Donaueschingen, Spiegel Online reported. A similar discovery was made over the weekend at a military base in Illkirch, France.

Illkirch is the same base where a German officer was arrested in late April and accused of planning a racially motivated attack by disguising himself as a refugee.

In Germany, it is illegal to possess items that show the swastika. The pieces found at the barracks in Donaueschingen didn't carry the insignia, so no one could be prosecuted, Reuters reported.

This isn't the first indication that a deep-seated admiration of Germany's Nazi past may still exist.

In 2012, the same military base in Illkirch was at the center of a scandal when German soldiers drew a 13-foot swastika on a soccer field to celebrate their team's victory. More recently, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party — in the running this year to enter parliament — have made openly anti-Semitic comments.

Von der Leyen faced backlash last week for blaming recent events on ""weak leadership"" in the German military, following the arrest of the soldier for allegedly planning the attack against refugees. She later apologized. But the defense minister had strong words again after the latest discoveries at the bases.

""This is about the reputation of our armed forces,"" Van der Leyen told Bild on Sunday. Those trained to bear arms for the nation ""have to adhere to stricter standards.""

6,"Sally Yates told White House aides Flynn was a Russian blackmail risk. 18 days later, he was fired.","That's how long it took the White House to fire national security adviser Michael Flynn after acting Attorney General Sally Yates met with White House counsel Don McGahn to inform him that Flynn wasn't telling the truth about his interactions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and, as a result, represented a blackmail risk.

""We believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,"" Yates said in a Senate subcommittee hearing aimed at gathering details of the Russian hacking of the 2016 election on Monday in Washington. She added: ""Logic would tell you that you don't want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him.""

Yates noted that she met with McGahn on January 26 and again on January 27 to inform him of the fact that Flynn's assertions -- as relayed in the media by Vice President Mike Pence -- were simply not accurate. She did so both because she thought the Justice Department owed it to the vice president to tell him what they knew but also because they knew the Russians knew of Flynn's problems.

Yates added that McGahn asked for -- and was granted -- the chance to examine the materials that led the Justice Department to their conclusion. She said she did not know whether McGahn or anyone else in the White House actually reviewed those materials. Yates also repeatedly said she decided to inform McGahn and the White House of what they knew of Flynn so the White House could ""take action.""

Put aside everything else -- Republican attempts to steer the hearing to the unmasking of Trump campaign officials, incidental collection, leaks and leakers -- that transpired in Monday's hearing. The only thing that really matters going forward is what led McGahn and the rest of the White House to not act on the warnings -- and evidence -- provided to them regarding Flynn for more than two weeks. And, when they did finally fire Flynn, why was the reason cited by the White House the fact that he had not told Pence the truth regarding meetings with Kislyak? After all, the White House -- via McGahn -- knew that information from January 26 onward.

Here's Trump's explanation, from a February 16 press conference, about when he learned about Flynn's conversations with Kislyak (it's long but important to excerpt broadly from):

JUST WATCHED Trump: Press illegally gets information Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Press illegally gets information 02:34

""As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.

It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said 'well I don't see' -- to me, he was doing the job.

The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said 'doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there.' But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.

That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.""

That just doesn't make sense. Trump says that the information provided to McGahn by Yates ""doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there."" But, according to Yates' testimony -- under oath! -- what she told McGahn was that Flynn was compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail risk.

So, either one of these two things is true:

Trump didn't see Yates' warning as passed to McGahn as cause for removal of Flynn. Trump didn't believe Yates was telling the truth about Flynn.

There's just no other options to explain why it took 18 days between Yates' telling McGahn that one of Trump's top national security advisers was compromised by Russia and that adviser being fired. And that, when Flynn was fired, the reason given was that he had not told the truth to the vice president as opposed to the fact that he was a prime target for Russian blackmail.

It's no longer an acceptable answer to say -- as Trump and White House advisers like Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus have -- that the information passed from Yates to McGahn was insignificant. Unless Yates is lying -- and no one has suggested she is -- then what she told McGahn on January 26 (and followed up on the next day) was of huge importance.

6,Judges appear divided on Trump's travel ban,"(CNN) Federal appeals court judges appeared divided Monday after hearing the Trump administration's defense of its travel ban, with one saying President Donald Trump never disavowed his campaign statements on keeping Muslims out of the country and another asking if the ban would still be illegitimate if Trump hadn't won the election.

""He's never repudiated what he said about the Muslim ban,"" Judge Robert B. King said, underscoring a key rationale for a Maryland federal district court's halt to the ban: That it is intended, as evidenced by Trump's campaign statements, to target Muslims and is therefore discriminatory.

But Judge Paul V. Niemeyer questioned the plaintiffs' attorney about his motive for opposing the ban.

""If some other candidate had won the election and issued this order, I gather you would have no problem with that,"" said Niemeyer, who was appointed by former President George H.W. Bush.

The nearly two-hour hearing before the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals came about two months after a federal judge in Maryland imposed a nationwide halt to the core portion of the President's revised executive order that sought to bar foreign nationals from six majority-Muslim countries from entering the US for 90 days. District Court Judge Theodore Chuang concluded, largely drawing on Trump's past statements, that the travel ban likely violates the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims, and the the Justice Department appealed that decision in March.

Jeffrey Wall, the acting solicitor general, argued Monday that Trump's statements about Muslims prior to taking office should not be considered evidence of discrimination. Wall emphasized that the revised travel ban was written after the President listened to judges' concerns that the original executive order discriminated against Muslims.

""(Trump) made it clear he was not talking about Muslims all over the world, that's why it's not a Muslim ban,"" Wall told judges.

But Omar Jadwat, a senior attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project, argued the ban does not serve a valid national security purpose.

""There's a logical problem with the order,"" Jadwat said, noting the countries selected by Trump are ""not the list of countries you come up"" with when outlining those that pose the biggest threats to the United States.

He called the ban ""completely unprecedented,"" saying it has caused ""extraordinary injury"" to the plaintiffs, whose families cannot visit them in the United States.

JUST WATCHED Hawaii judge extends order blocking travel ban Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hawaii judge extends order blocking travel ban 02:19

The judges used the first half hour of the hearing to question Wall on how Trump's second order changed from the first, which critics have labeled a clear Muslim ban.

King, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, continued in that vein, pointing out that, as of Monday, the ""District Court here found the [ban] is on his campaign website.""

The controversial plan was removed from Trump's campaign website Monday, shortly after White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that he was unaware that the plan was still online.

The plan has been used against the administration's attempt to suspend travel to seven -- then six -- Muslim-majority countries and halt the admission of Syrian refugees into the United States.

Chuang, the district court judge, said in March that despite the Trump administration's assertion that the order was a travel ban, not a Muslim ban, ""the history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the second executive order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban.""

On Monday, Wall emphasized that the President made his campaign vow to ban Muslims ""before he took the oath.""

""It is an archived press statement from 16 months ago,"" Wall said when asked. ""We took an oath and formed a government.""

The judges also asked Wall if the administration has been able to review the vetting procedures since Trump issued the first travel ban in late January.

""What we have been doing since January 27 is just litigating this order,"" Wall replied.

Jadwat, meanwhile, struggled to answer the judges' questions about what exactly he claimed is wrong with the text of the travel ban. The judges also asked the ACLU attorney whether his organization would challenge the same travel ban order if someone besides Trump signed it.

""What if [Trump] said he was sorry every day for a year?"" Judge Dennis Shedd asked.

""Sorry is not enough,"" Jadwat said.

Following the hearing, the ACLU held a press conference outside the courthouse featuring a handful of speakers who oppose the ban.

""The Muslim and refugee ban is a clear example of politics of hate and xenophobia,"" said Marielena Hincapié, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. ""This is part of a larger agenda that this administration has against people of color, Muslims, trans community and many others.""

Normally, such an appeal of a district court's decision would be heard by a randomly assigned panel of three judges, and the losing party may ask for it to be reheard by the full court.

Yet in this case, the judges on the 4th Circuit decided it should be heard by the full court -- otherwise known as ""en banc"" -- in the first instance. Ten of the 15 active judges on the court are either Clinton or Obama appointees. A source familiar with the case told CNN that Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III -- a Reagan appointee and one of the most highly respected judges on the court -- recused himself from the case because Wall is his son-in-law as well as his former law clerk. Judge Allyson Duncan, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, also stepped aside. That means 10 of the 13 judges who heard Monday's case were appointed by Democrats.

What's at stake?

This is not the Trump administration's first legal showdown over the President's travel ban.

The original executive order was swiftly blocked nationwide by a federal judge in Seattle, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it, and then the administration spent over a month rewriting it, exempting several categories of foreign travelers and taking care to make no express mention of religion -- all in the hopes of avoiding legal scrutiny for a second time around.

Yet statements from Trump and his advisers, especially when combined with his continued inclusion of a 90-day ban on foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries in the revised executive order, have proved -- at least for now -- insurmountable in court.

The suit in front of the 4th Circuit on Monday was brought by several refugee rights organizations, along with individual plaintiffs who claim the executive order, if allowed to go into effect, would separate them from loved ones abroad. They also claim that the ""anti-Muslim animus"" underlying the second executive order is readily apparent from the litany of public statements Trump made before and after the presidential campaign.

Chuang disagreed with the administration's argument that Trump's campaign statements shouldn't count in lawsuits, noting that Trump's campaign website still contained a statement on "" preventing Muslim immigration "" at the time.

Chuang went on to explain that the consideration of such evidence by a federal court is a matter of ""common sense,"" as such ""explicit statements of a religious purpose are 'readily discoverable facts' that allow the court to identify the purpose of this government action without resort to 'judicial psychoanalysis.'""

""Simply because a decisionmaker made the statements during a campaign does not wipe them from the 'reasonable memory' of a 'reasonable observer,'"" Chuang added.

As a result, the crux of the issue on appeal is likely whether the 4th Circuit agrees it is permissible to look outside of the four corners of the executive order to examine its purpose.

""We believe that it makes little sense as a matter of law and logic to ignore the President's own statements telling the country what the purpose of this (executive order) is,"" explained Lee Gelernt, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys and deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, in an interview with CNN. ""This is not a situation where we have to psychoanalyze the President. The President has made clear why he's doing this.""

The Justice Department declined to comment beyond the legal briefs in the pending case.

If the Trump administration wins in the 4th Circuit, will the ban immediately go back into effect?

Short answer: no.

A second federal judge in Hawaii, US District Court Judge Derrick Watson, issued a nationwide ruling that halted the 90-day travel ban on the same grounds as Chuang, finding it likely violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims. Yet Watson's decision was slightly broader in scope and paused Trump's 120-day ban on refugee admissions as well.

So if the Justice Department prevails in the 4th Circuit, the case will then go back to the district court judge for further litigation and the key portions of the revised executive order will stay on hold as long as Watson's nationwide decision remains in effect.

The Trump administration's challenge to Watson's ruling will be heard by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle next Monday.",cnn
6,Trump's pick for Air Force secretary confirmed,"Story highlights The new Air Force secretary was confirmed with 76 votes in favor and 22 against

This is only the second Senate-confirmed position at the Pentagon since Trump took office

(CNN) Heather Wilson, President Donald Trump's pick for secretary of the Air Force, was confirmed by the Senate Monday with 76 votes in favor and 22 against.

Wilson is the first service secretary to be confirmed in the Trump administration and is only the second Senate-confirmed position at the Pentagon since he took office, with the other being Secretary of Defense James Mattis.

Wilson is a 1982 graduate of the US Air Force Academy, a Rhodes Scholar and a former member of Congress, representing New Mexico from 1998 to 2009.

During her confirmation hearings, Wilson said she plans to address the Air Force's pilot shortage as well as seek additional funding for the service's modernization efforts.

Her bipartisan confirmation is likely to be welcome news for the Trump White House, which has struggled to fill some of the Pentagon's top posts more than 100 days after inauguration.

10,Don't panic: iPhone 8 release is reportedly right on schedule,"Whispers of a jeopardized iPhone 8 launch due to production issues have circulated for a few weeks now, but a new report suggests the new iPhone is actually right on schedule.

Apple will unveil its next iPhones in September before going on sale in October, according to Economic Daily News sources (via DigiTimes). Apple's parts suppliers are reportedly on track to meet an August/September mass production schedule, with some key components already set to ramp up beginning next month.

Apple is widely expected to announce the iPhone 8 to mark the iconic smartphone's 10th anniversary this year along with the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, two phones that follow the tech giant's traditional update cycle.

The Economic Daily News report flies in the face of an analyst who, citing sources, said the iPhone 8's ""significant hardware upgrades"" have led to a two-month schedule slip, pushing the necessary production ramp up to October or November.

While Apple could have still unveiled the iPhone 8 in September, this rumored clog would have potentially led to limited supplies and lower-than-expected sales in the all-important holiday quarter.

Here are the best iPhone 7 deals this month

Wait. Did you say, October?

Though the iPhone 8 and its cohorts don't seem to be facing production delays, it's worth pointing out the new iPhones' sale dates are being circled for sometime in October.

This is later than Apple's typical iPhone releases, when the handsets hit store shelves in September.

Apple apparently anticipated releasing its iPhone trio in October all along, so while there's technically no delay, it will be later than shoppers are used to seeing. This could be due to the iPhone 8's rumored upgrades, though we're just speculating.

The iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are expected to be relatively minor upgrades over last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, with the real ""wow"" saved for the iPhone 8.

The device is said to sport a curved design, edge-to-edge display, vertical dual-camera lens, wireless charging and augmented reality features, among other additions. iPhone shoppers are already holding out for Apple's 10th anniversary smartphone, so the real question now is: can the 8 meet all the hype?",techradar
10,"Invoke Cortana speaker: release date, news and rumors","We have truly entered the age of the digital assistant. When Apple first introduced Siri to our iPhones back in 2011 it seemed like a novelty without much purpose. Now digital assistants are establishing themselves as a solid part of everyday life, not only on our mobile devices but in our homes too.

Both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home have set themselves up as must-have accessories for early adopters of smart speaker home technology. With two years having passed since the first Echo getting released, there have been rumors about Microsoft joining the fray, and now we’re starting to see some solid info about the speaker from hi-fi speaker manufacturer Harman Kardon that’ll house Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana in your home.

Here you will find all the information we have about Harman Kardon’s Cortana-powered speaker, the Invoke.

Cut to the chase

What is it? A smart speaker powered by Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana, made by Harman Kardon

A smart speaker powered by Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana, made by Harman Kardon When is it out? Fall 2017

Fall 2017 What will it cost? Currently unclear, but we are expecting a premium price tag

Invoke release date

According to a now removed page on the official Harman Kardon website found by Slash Gear, the Invoke is: “Coming Fall 2017” although what this means for when you’ll actually be able to have one in your home is currently unclear.

Microsoft holds an annual event in October, which could be when we will see the official launch of the Invoke, although currently the speaker's development looks like its being spearheaded by Harman Kardon and just happens to have Cortana on board, so the launch could potentially happen independently of Microsoft.

We were originally hoping to see a Cortana powered speaker at tech conference CES 2017, and while we didn’t, we did see Cortana integration for both BMW and Nissan cars, so possibly Microsoft’s strategy is to put Cortana into other manufacturer’s devices rather than actually produce one of its own, for now at least.

According to MSPoweruser, there are rumors that Cortana’s speaker integration will be showcased at Microsoft’s Build 2017 developers conference, with the Invoke being a possible attendee.

I was told that Microsoft will show off and detail Cortana on speakers (and possibly the Harman Kardon Invoke) at Build 2017 next month.April 26, 2017

Invoke features

While information is fairly thin on the ground about the capabilities of the speaker, it is safe to assume that it will follow in the same vein as the Amazon Echo and the Google Home. It will certainly be able to play music, answer questions and control your smart home products.

In terms of playing music, we know from a recently discovered device setup app that the Invoke (and any Cortana-powered speaker) should have the ability to select which music app is the source for your music, meaning you can play music from Spotify, Pandora, and others.

This feature was revealed when Microsoft released a Device Setup app in April, leading us to think that a Cortana-powered speaker was imminent.

Smart home product integration is still slightly untested ground, so it will be interesting to see which products play nicely with this first generation device.

What looks like it will really set Invoke apart is its ability to make phone calls, a feature that is still missing from all the current competitors on the market. This will technically take the form of a Skype voice call, but using an app for calls looks like it may be the way voice calling is going, with recent rumors hinting that Apple will be replacing voice calls with Facetime Audio on iOS 11.

Invoke design

The Invoke looks more than a little like the Amazon Echo, although when creating a speaker with 360 degree sound it's probably inevitable that you’re going to create something fairly cylindrical. It's crafted out of metal, and looks like it’s going to come in either a chrome or black finish.

A smart move?

Harman Kardon has a reputation for high quality speakers so one of the things we can be certain of is that the Invoke will sound good. What’s uncertain is the price tag. We're assuming that with its premium looks and the likelihood of premium guts, it will almost certainly come at a premium price.

With an Apple smart speaker in the pipeline, and with Amazon opening up its development tool-kit so that anyone can make a speaker with their mic set-up, the market is likely to get very crowded in the next few years. Microsoft needs to find a unique selling point for its smart speaker and it will be interesting to see if the Invoke is positioned as the ‘premium’ option.",techradar
1,"At college commencement speeches in 2017,  it's a no-Trump zone on most campuses","Graduates turn their tassels during the conferring of degrees portion of the commencement ceremony at Radford University May 6, 2017. (Photo: Heather Rousseau, AP)

Caution: If you attend a campus commencement address this spring, you could be entering a no-Trump zone.

Most college and university graduation speakers contacted by USA TODAY said they would not address the elephant in the stadium. And mention of the president and party politics has been conspicuously absent from the speeches that already have been given.

“If they invited a politician to speak, they’d get what they expected. Since they didn’t, I’ll take that as a direction’’ and avoid the subject, said former NASA astronaut Kathryn Thornton, who may speak about space exploration at Sweet Briar College in Virginia.

“Anybody whose commencement speech could be put on the editorial page of a newspaper doesn't understand the job,’’ said Anthony Esolen, an English literature scholar who will speak at Hillsdale College in Michigan. His advice: “Leave the shifting sand dunes of the day far behind.’’

As for Trump, he asked, “Why on earth should I mention the president? …. I have instead to decide whether I will talk about Milton or Dante or Dr. Johnson…’’

That seems like a sound approach to Cristina Negrut, a connoisseur of commencement speeches who founded the website graduationwisdom.com. Love Trump or hate him, “we already have enough people trying to label him, like Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes,’’ she said. “Another label – ‘liar’ or something -- is not helpful.’’

The talk at graduation is of everything but Trump, including memories of a graduation past (writing coach Roy Peter Clark at Providence College); indigenous American languages (2016 MacArthur genius grant winner Daryl Baldwin at Miami University in Ohio); mountain climbing (mountaineer Conrad Anker at the University of Utah).

Speakers cited tried and true rules for commencement speeches to explain why they will not talk about the man everyone else is talking about.

It’s about the graduates, not the speaker’s politics

The most common piece of advice a first-time graduation speaker receives may be “it’s not about you.’’ It’s good counsel, said CNN political analyst Fareed Zakaria, who has delivered commencement addresses at Harvard, Sarah Lawrence and the University of Oklahoma, and this year speaks at Bucknell. “My views on Donald Trump are well known and easily discoverable. There’s no need for me to impress them on students and their families.’’

But it’s not all about the graduates

Even if the graduate would enjoy hearing the speaker trash the president, Grandpa or Grandma – who keeps Fox News on all day – might not. And it’s his day, too.

Accentuate the positive

“You want to strike a celebratory note,’’ Esolen said, and an optimistic one. These days, that pretty much rules out politics. “I’ll leave notions of ‘American carnage,’ for another venue,’’ Thornton said – a dry allusion to the signature phrase in Trump’s inaugural address

Eliminate the ephemeral

Esolen said politics is fine in a commencement speech – “if you are talking about Edmund Burke or Tocqueville or Aristotle.’’

The writer Anna Quindlen, who estimates she’s given three dozen commencement speeches over the years, plans to strike a similar note at Washington University in St. Louis: “I prefer to try something that will stand the test of time.’’

Jonathan LaPook, CBS News’ medical correspondent and an NYU professor of medicine, said he doesn’t plan to touch on the Affordable Care Act debate when he speaks at the Quinnipiac University Medical School: “This is their first graduating class, so I have to be a little evergreen.’’

Make ‘em laugh

“Funny speeches are best,’’ said Negrut, the speech maven. She points approvingly to Modern Family sitcom creator Steve Levitan’s You Tube video previewing his speech this month at his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It features MF’s Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) announcing Levitan as the speaker, but claiming never to have heard of him.

Zakaria said that if he mentions Trump at all, he will probably do so humorously, because “there is so much about him that lends itself to humor.‘’ But that also is tough, he said: “There is so much competition.’’

Clark, founder of the National Writers Workshop, recalls the uses of humor from his own graduation from Providence in the grim Vietnam War year of 1970, when spring classes ended early because of student anti-war protests.

The speaker was the political humorist Art Buchwald. He didn’t attack President Nixon by name, but let the graduates – some of whom who’d be drafted – know he understood their concerns about Nixon and the war. Clark never forgot how Buchwald ended: “Years from now, when people ask you what you did at your graduation, you can say you laughed.’’

Sincerity and levity

Some speakers will talk about Trump. Maz Jobrani, the Iranian-American stand-up comedian, is giving the speech at his alma mater, UCal-Berkeley. “I have to talk about him, because I’m an immigrant,’’ he said. “The best graduation talks are sincere, and I have a lot of sincere feelings about his impact. He needs to take responsibility for his words.’’

Some audiences want a political message. On a campus like Berkeley, which has become a battleground over political speech, an anti-Trump message presumably would resonate. A place like Liberty University in Virginia, where Trump himself will deliver the commencement, is another story.

“How to handle the national zeitgeist at this particular moment is a struggle,’’ Quidlen said. “I'm hoping to speak to the graduates about who we are as individuals and as a nation, and who we hope to be, in a way that is informed at some level by the tone in Washington.’’

During commencement season 2016, when Trump was the presumptive GOP nominee, he was the target of several high-profile attacks. At Stanford, documentarian Ken Burns accused Trump (without mentioning his name) of nurturing “an incipient proto-fascism’’ as well as “jingoistic saber rattling’’ and “dictatorial tendencies.’’

He acknowledged that it was an unusual setting for such a polemic, but said, “There comes a time when I -- and you -- can no longer remain neutral, silent.’’ He got a standing ovation.

At Johns Hopkins, director Spike Lee worried Trump would start World War III. At MIT, actor Matt Damon asked why, if our world is one of many simulations run by a superior civilization, “we're in the one where Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee? Can we, like, transfer to a different one?'’

This year, many campus speakers are politicians – Joe Biden at Cornell, Colby and Harvard, Hillary Clinton at Wellesley and Medgar Evers College in New York City, Bernie Sanders at Brooklyn College, Sen. Elizabeth Warren at UMass-Amherst and Wheelock College, Vice President Mike Pence at the Naval Academy and Notre Dame and Trump as the Coast Guard Academy.

It’s not clear if their speeches will be partisan. One early return: House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, speaking May 1 at Fisk University in Nashville, did not mention Trump, saying only that ""The election showed how much work needs to be done to rid our nation of negative attitudes…’’

Thornton, who teaches at the University of Virginia, said speakers should understand that the world will not long remember what they say: “I’ve been going to graduations for over 20 years and I can’t remember a word, or who gave it. I’m speaking on Saturday; by Sunday they’ll have forgotten everything. So I figure the pressure is off.’’

16,Richard Simmons sues tabloids over false sex-change story,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share After years of media speculation over the whereabouts of Richard Simmons, he reportedly is speaking up for himself—with a lawsuit. USA TODAY

Richard Simmons is fighting back against the tabloids.

In a libel lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, the fitness guru is calling out National Enquirer, Radar Online and American Media, Inc., for publishing ""cruel and malicious"" articles about him transitioning from male to female.

Stories appearing in those publications between June 2016 and March 2017 had headlines about Simmons' ""shocking sex surgery,"" which the workout personality has denied he's undergone. The Associated Press, People and The Hollywood Reporter have obtained a copy of the suit.

According to THR, the complaint reads, ""National Enquirer and Radar Online have miscalculated."" The suit calls the reports ""particularly egregious"" — not because transitioning isn't OK, but because that isn't an accurate representation of Simmons' identity.

""The National Enquirer and Radar Online have cheaply and crassly commercialized and sensationalized an issue that ought to be treated with respect and sensitivity. Principles of freedom of speech and press may protect their prerogative to mock and degrade the LGBTQ community ... (but) Mr. Simmons, like every person in this nation, has a legal right to insist that he not be portrayed as someone he is not. Even the most ardent supporter of sexual autonomy and LGBTQ rights is entitled to be portrayed in a manner that is truthful.""

People reports that Simmons is also calling out his former associate, Mauro Oliveira, for sharing the false and libelous sex-change information with National Enquirer and Radar Online, and having “blackmailed, extorted and stalked” him.

American Media, Inc., which owns both National Enquirer and Radar Online, directed USA TODAY to a statement online that references the lawsuit.

""For Mr. Simmons to claim that his privacy has been invaded is hypocritical when his entire livelihood is based upon the public consumption of his image,"" the statement reads. ""To wit, Mr. Simmons signed a lucrative merchandising deal with a major branding company in April to handle licensing of his name and likeness. At the same time, he protests that he is entitled to privacy and therefore should not be subjected to scrutiny of the media, which has raised reasonable questions about his health and whereabouts since he disappeared from the public eye almost four years ago. ... We stand by our reporting about Mr. Simmons, and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and win public vindication of our reports.""

AP reports that the lawsuit, which says Simmons often dressed in drag as part of ""his well-known and long-standing burlesque-style entertainment persona,"" seeks unspecified damages as well as an apology and retraction for the stories.

Simmons has reluctantly been in the limelight recently after a podcast about his low profile, Missing Richard Simmons, became one of the most popular podcasts in the country. Since then, Simmons was hospitalized for indigestion and released.

When contacted by USA TODAY, Simmons' longtime representative, Tom Estey, had no comment on the reported lawsuit.

9,Michael Vick hopes NFL rookie Joe Mixon is 'humbled',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Michael Vick spoke at Willie Colon's charity golf event benifitting research for lupus. Andy Vasquez/NorthJersey.com

Former NFL quarterback Michael Vick (Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS)

BERNARDSVILLE — Michael Vick knows what it's like to make the kind of decision that haunts you for the rest of your life.

The former NFL quarterback also knows about trying to move past that mistake, and embracing a second chance.

And so when Vick looks at running back Joe Mixon, the Cincinnati Bengals' controversial draft pick this season, he hopes Mixon understands just how fortunate he is to be playing in the NFL.

""Joe got an opportunity,"" Vick said Monday at the Willie Colon Charity Golf Outing benefitting Lupus Research Alliance. ""He's an exceptional talent. Other than that, he [wouldn't] get that opportunity. I think he's learned from it and hopefully he's humbled by what's happened to him.""

The Cincinnati Bengals have received backlash for drafting Oklahoma's Joe Mixon. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports)

Mixon, who starred in college at Oklahoma, has all the skills to be a successful NFL running back. He was projected to be a first round pick. But in July 2014, Mixon was arrested for punching Ameila Molitor in the face while in college.

Many teams viewed the incident as unacceptable and took Mixon off their draft board. Jets general manager Mike Maccagnan strongly hinted that the team wouldn't draft Mixon.

Mixon fell to the second round in last month's draft, where he was selected 48th overall by the Bengals.

Vick, of course, made his own terrible decision when he was one of the best and most popular players in football. He spent nearly two years in federal prison after being convicted for his role in a dogfighting ring.

That ugly incident remains a part of Vick's legacy -- it always will be. But after two years away of the league, Vick returned to play seven seasons and start 48 games with the Eagles, Jets and Steelers.

Vick has long said he hopes others can learn from his mistakes. And now, he hopes others can learn from Mixon's error, too -- including Mixon.

""He wouldn't have done it if he knew what he'd be dealing with now,"" Vick said of Mixon. ""And I think kids have just got to use that as an example.""

After his arrest, Mixon accepted a plea deal for misdemeanor assault and was suspended for the 2014 college football season. Security footage released to the public in December showed Molitor shove Mixon in the chest and slap him on the neck before Mixon knocked her to the ground with a right hand to the face. Molitor suffered several broken bones in her face as a result. Mixon and Molitor reached a settlement last month.

""Joe is young man, and he made a mistake,"" Vick said. ""Let's be honest. You rarely see guys having encounters like that, and it should never happen. I never condone it, I don't think it's right at all.""

9,"Ezekiel Elliott, Dak Prescott explain what they’ve been working on in the offseason | FOX Sports","Ezekiel Elliott had one of the best rookie campaigns by a running back in NFL history, falling 177 yards shy of Eric Dickerson’s rookie rushing record despite sitting out the final week of the season. Dak Prescott went from somewhat of an afterthought fourth-round pick to Cowboys’ franchise quarterback, leading the team to a dramatic turnaround in 2016.

But that doesn’t mean Elliott and Prescott haven’t been working on their games in the offseason. The reigning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and star quarterback participated in the Cowboys’ home run derby Monday and discussed what they’ve been looking to improve upon in their sophomore season.

“Becoming a more dominant second-level runner,” Elliott said, via the Dallas Morning News. “I think there were a couple of times last year where I could’ve been [better] on certain runs when I got to the second level. So just kinda focused on finishing my runs and making guys miss at the second level.”

That must be a scary thought for opposing defenders. Elliott, who led the NFL in rushing yards and attempts last season, consistently got to the second level thanks in part to the Cowboys’ dominant offensive line.

If Elliott, who had three runs last year that went for more than 40 yards, adds some elusiveness to his game, he could threaten to become the eighth player in history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season.

As for Prescott, he wants to progress in all facets.

“I’m only one season in, so the whole game,” said Prescott, who threw for 3,667 yards with 23 touchdowns and four interceptions as a rookie. “There’s a lot of things. I can study film better, get better at my drop-backs, be more accurate at times. There’s a lot I can get better at.”

Judging by the footage from Monday’s home run derby, neither will focusing on becoming two-sport stars anytime soon.

9,Jessica Andrade explains exactly how she will knockout Joanna Jedrzejcyzk at UFC 211 | FOX Sports,"Through her first three fights at strawweight in the UFC, Jessica Andrade has been as dominant as anyone on the roster as she’s torn through her opponents en route to a championship this weekend in Dallas.

At UFC 211, Andrade will face Joanna Jedrzejczyk, who is currently the second longest reigning champion in the UFC behind Demetrious Johnson as she looks for her fifth consecutive title defense.

While Jedrzejczyk has experienced a few minor hiccups in her fights, she’s been fairly dominant during her reign as champion while taking out every contender the division has thrown at her including two wins over highly touted grappler Claudia Gadelha.

As much as Jedrzejczyk has been able to dispatch all of her past opponents, Andrade has still seen a few weaknesses in her game and one particularly glaring flaw that stood out to her during the champion’s last title defense against Karolina Kowalkiewicz last November.

“Watching the last fight, especially, we saw that Karolina [Kowalkiewicz] was a girl that didn’t back away from Joanna when she was getting pressured, which was something new. Pretty much everybody that fought her before, once Joanna put pressure they would walk back. We noticed that she didn’t do as well with other people that would back away from her,” Andrade described when speaking to FOX Sports.

“We are very much aware of everything Joanna does well and we are even more aware of what I do well and how those two match. If Claudia [Gadelha] was able to knock her down with a jab, once my straight [punch] lands or one of my hooks, I know there’s going to be a party in Brazil.”

Harry How/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

Andrade is well known for the way she stalks opponents across the Octagon before unleashing a hellish flurry of punches.

Like many of the old school greats from Brazil such as Wanderlei Silva or Mauricio “Shogun” Rua, Andrade is relentless with her offensive onslaught and she’s not sure Jedrzejczyk has ever faced anyone like her before or maybe never will again.

“The way that I put pressure on in fights is something Joanna has never had to deal with. She’s not used to someone just bullying her or just grabbing her and with pressure all the time,” Andrade said. “This is something we’re expecting her to have problems with because she is so technical, she is someone who comes from a really strong technical background. We know this from history that people who are too technical, they sometimes lose themselves with an opponent who are not as technical or not as predictable as them. This is something we are really hoping will make a difference. We know that it’s going to make a difference cause I’ll be honest, it’s really difficult to prepare against someone like me.

“The way that I fight, it’s not easy for my opponent to just sit there and think. Once I start getting my punches going, they aren’t going to have time to think.”

Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports

Of course, Andrade doesn’t discount what Jedrzejczyk offers in return because she wouldn’t be champion for as long as she’s been without a ton of skill to counter everything her opponents throw at her.

Before she was UFC champion, Jedrzejczyk was a multi-time title holder in Muay Thai kickboxing and she’s translated her striking art to mixed martial arts where she’s become one of the most fearsome stand up fighters in the world.

As strange as it might sound, Andrade concedes that Jedrzejczyk is probably the better technical kickboxer in this fight, but that doesn’t mean she won’t get hurt when getting punched in the mouth with a thudding left or right hand from the Brazilian contender.

“The thing with Joanna, she does have a lot of punching power but it comes a lot from speed and technique. We are very much aware of that. I’m not as technical as her, probably won’t ever be because that’s not the game that works for me,” Andrade said. “I know my strength. I know there’s probably no one at strawweight that is as strong as I am. There’s probably no other strawweight that has the power and strength that I have and that’s going to show in the fight.

“I don’t think she can even prepare for someone my size and my strength in her camp. It’s not something very easy to prepare for.”

Between her strategy to put the pressure on Jedrzejczyk from the opening bell to the power she possesses in both hands, Andrade feels like she has every weapon necessary to walk into UFC 211 as the challenger and walk out as the champion.

Andrade absolutely respects Jedrzejczyk but that’s not going to save her once they step into the Octagon together where she’s predicting a violent end to the fight.

“Since we got the fight, even before, I’ve seen the fight playing out in many ways. I think I could knock her out, I could finish her. She’s got that long skinny neck that I could grab onto and get a submission,” Andrade described. “Honestly, the way I see it, I’m going to get a knock out before the third round.

“At some point in those 15 minutes, my hand is going to connect and I’m not going to let her get back up. I’m not going to let her recover. I’m predicting a knockout by the third round.”",fox-sports

9,"Maria Sharapova loses grudge match to Genie Bouchard, who called for her lifetime ban | FOX Sports","Two weeks after calling Maria Sharapova a “cheater” who should be banned from tennis for life, Genie Bouchard doled out her own punishment to her former, fallen idol, defeating Sharapova 7-5, 2-6, 6-4 in a fortuitous and dramatic second-round meeting at the Madrid Open.

The expected fireworks were strictly limited to the play – anyone hoping for the off-court comments to spill over into any sort of mid-match antics would have been sorely disappointed, except for the fact that the match had more twists and turns than Sharapova’s suspension drama. Bouchard won the first set, was outclassed in the second and appeared to be heading for the inevitable defeat when she went down 1-2, 0-40 on her serve in the third set. She battled back to win the game and then, after three straight breaks starting at 3-3, the Canadian saved a break point at 5-4 and held serve to win the two-hour, 51-minute marathon in Spain.

(AP) AP/Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Bouchard, who grew up rooting for Sharapova, said in April that she’d lost respect for the Russian after her drug ban and declared her ability to return to tournaments via wild cards unfair to other players. The comments, which were the harshest of the many anti-Sharapova sentiments on tour, set up a match that had the anticipation of a Grand Slam final, despite being a Monday meeting at a second-tier tournament that was played immediately after a Mikhail Kukushkin match.

Officially it was a matchup between the No. 60 and No. 262 players in the world but the rankings belied the talent and stakes. Bouchard, a former Wimbledon finalist, has plummeted to No. 60 in the world and entered the tournament without a tour win since January’s Australian Open. Two years ago, she’d been ranked No. 6. Sharapova, of course, is a five-time Grand Slam champion who just finished a 15-month suspension for taking the drug meldonium, a medication that had only been added to the banned list weeks before.

Her comeback has been controversial due to those wild cards, an argument that ignored two simple facts: Sharapova is still one of the best players in the world and that tournaments exist to make money. If anyone else had been playing Genie Bouchard on a Monday night in Madrid, it’s safe to say the match would have barely registered with tennis Twitter, let alone earn worldwide attention. She deserves what people will give her.

(AP) AP/Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Rising to the occasion, Bouchard played her best match in months though both players struggled, the latter blowing multiple opportunities to blow open, or stay in, the third set. On one of the biggest points of the evening, the Russian had an easy, open backhand to even the match at 5-5 in the decider. She pushed it wide. Whether she was too amped up (the grunts started at a high decibel and only got louder from there), too nervous or had too little muscle memory – who knows. Bouchard won the next three points, sealing the match with a forehand, cross-court winner.

Sharapova will lament the missed opportunities and perhaps her strategy too; she went for winners early in rallies which, against Bouchard, is a little like a baseball player going up hacking against a pitcher who can’t throw strikes.

For those hoping for drama of the non-tennis variety, even the handshake, usually the moment where built-up friction tends to play out, was anticlimactic – which isn’t to say it was without some perceived tension. Sharapova walked to the net and appeared to say “well played,” while Bouchard shot her an icy glare, said nothing and held her stare for a split-second longer.

In the end though, it was barely confrontational. (Bouchard, with her one career title, waited until she was in the safety of the interview room before throwing shade.) There was no need for it to be anything more. Maria Sharapova and Genie Bouchard had spent the previous three hours playing out their beef. The scoreboard said more than any handshake ever could.",fox-sports
9,Jay Cutler explains how Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky can be successful in Chicago | FOX Sports,"Doug Gottlieb: “I’ve heard you say that [the Bears] ‘shouldn’t play Trubisky. No matter how far downhill it goes, you should let him sit, you should let him learn, you got Mike Glennon, you’ll be fine.’ Can Chicago create the type of environment that allows him to be successful?”

Jay Cutler: “I think they can. I think they’ve got the people there that know what it takes to have a good quarterback. I mean you look across the league and to have good quarterback play, you’ve got to have good players around the quarterback. That’s just kind of how it goes. There’s no one out there winning games and throwing for huge numbers unless they have some [good players] around them.

""I think maybe the one rare exception to that rule is Aaron [Rodgers], because he makes so many plays outside the pocket and on the run. Other than that, guys have really good players around them.

""I think the Bears know that. You look at the roster now and I’m sure there’s going to be some guys that flash and are a little bit unexpected. And maybe the kid comes in and he’s unbelievable and he lights up training camp and he’s a lot more ready than anyone thinks. That’s definitely a possibility.

""But with Dowell [Loggains] there, the offensive coordinator, and John Fox, he’s been around the block a lot, and Ryan Pace coming from New Orleans, seeing how they mold around the quarterback - they’ve definitely got people there that know what they’re doing, it’s just finding the right guys.”",fox-sports

3,South Korea election: Polls open to choose new president,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Voters are choosing between 13 candidates

South Koreans are voting in a presidential election, called early after a huge corruption scandal brought down their former leader.

Left-leaning Moon Jae-in is the clear front-runner with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo his nearest challenger.

The election is being closely watched at a time of economic uncertainty and heightened tensions with North Korea.

Mr Moon wants to increase contact with the North in contrast to ex-leader Park Geun-hye who cut almost all ties.

On the final day of campaigning, Mr Moon called for an ""overwhelming victory"", saying it would help to heal a national divide caused by the downfall and impeachment of conservative Ms Park.

Mr Ahn, campaigning in swing states, said he was still confident he could win.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Opinion polls have put Moon Jae-in as the front-runner

In March, Park Geun-hye became the first South Korean president to be removed from power by impeachment.

She denies wrongdoing - though has repeatedly apologised - and is standing trial on charges of bribery and abuse of power.

Mr Moon narrowly lost to Ms Park in the last presidential election in 2012.

He has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Ahn Cheol-Soo is a former medical doctor turned software tycoon

He says he favours a two-track approach to encourage change, using increased dialogue alongside sanctions.

The BBC's Korea correspondent Stephen Evans says this could lead to tensions with Washington.

If US President Donald Trump pursues a hard line against the North - especially if it stages another nuclear test - Mr Moon's approach could cause greater tension between Seoul and Washington, he says.

As well as North Korea, domestic issues are high on the agenda for voters.

All the candidates are promising to protect the fragile recovery in South Korea's economy - the fourth largest in Asia - and to bring down youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high.

There are also promises to rein in perceptions of elitism in South Korean political society and reform the family-run conglomerates - chaebols - which dominate the domestic economy.

Observers are expecting a high turnout at the ballot boxes, with numbers boosted by younger voters.

Polls close at 20:00 local time (11:00 GMT), with the winner expected to be announced soon after.",bbc-news
6,Five things we learned from the Sally Yates hearing,"(CNN) Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have now filled in some key pieces of the sprawling puzzle presented by the Russia investigations.

Here are the top five things we learned from their appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Monday:

1. Yates delivered a forceful argument to the White House that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn could be blackmailed by the Russians

As soon as she read the details of Michael Flynn's interview with the FBI, at the end of January, Yates called White House counsel Don McGahn and said they needed to talk in private, she testified.

Yates brought one of her top staffers with her on the afternoon of January 26 to meet with McGahn and one of his top aides inside a secure facility on the White House grounds so they could discuss the FBI's interview of Flynn. It was then, she testified before senators Monday, that she warned McGahn that President Donald Trump's national security adviser could easily become a blackmail target for Russians, based on the answers Flynn gave to the FBI.

""That created a compromised situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians. Finally, we told them that we were giving them all of this information so that they could take action, the action that they deemed appropriate,"" she said. McGahn called Yates and asked her to return the next morning, January 27, when she testified that he asked her about four main concerns:

Why did it matter to the Justice Department if Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence?

What criminal statutes did Flynn potentially violate?

Would taking action against Flynn immediately interfere with the FBI's investigation?

Could he see the underlying evidence collected in Flynn's interview?

Yates explained that any official publicly repeating the lie that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, was increasing the chance Flynn would be blackmailed.

""Every time this lie was repeated and the misrepresentations were getting more and more specific, as they were coming out, every time that happened, it increased the compromise and to state the obvious: You don't want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians,"" Yates said.

Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, declined comment when reached by CNN Monday.

2. Trump is increasingly looking alone in his belief that Russia did not interfere to help him in the 2016 election

Trump has repeatedly called the investigations of possible coordination between his campaign aides and Russia ""fake news"" and, last week, said it may have been China that was behind the hacking.

That's an assessment that's looking increasingly detached from US intelligence officials.

""To me, the evidence was overwhelming, and very compelling, that the Russians did this,"" Clapper testified, when asked about Trump's most recent assertions.

Then, prompted by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, Clapper said Trump may still be helping the Russians by denying their involvement.

""You could rationalize that it helps the Russians by obfuscating who was actually responsible,"" Clapper said.

3. Clapper and Yates undercut one of the Trump White House's strongest arguments

Throughout the Russia probes, the Trump White House has pointed to testimony earlier this year from Clapper that he had seen no evidence in the January intelligence report of collusion between the President's campaign and Russia. That was before FBI Director James Comey publicly revealed that the FBI was, in fact, investigating that question.

Clapper said Comey's March 20 testimony was the first he heard of the FBI investigation. He later said that his original assessment was that there was no evidence he had seen worth including in the intelligence assessment -- but Yates later said that she could not answer the question because she did not want to reveal any classified information.

The implication from both officials' testimonies was that there may, indeed, be evidence of collusion -- this after months of the White House arguing that Clapper was clear there is no evidence.

4. The Senate investigations have strong strains of partisanship

Monday's hearing with Yates and Clapper was clearly focused on Russia's interference in the 2016 election, but Republican and Democratic senators still used it to land some partisan shots.

Republican senators grilled Yates on why she refused to enforce the first executive order that imposed a travel ban issued by Trump.

""I don't mean any disrespect: Who appointed you to the Supreme Court?"" Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told Yates in a comment that immediately lit up Twitter.

And Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz went to town on Yates, arguing that she may have broken the law by refusing to defend the order. She rebutted him by pointing to a later court ruling that supported her argument that she had a greater duty to protect against discrimination and uphold the Constitution.

Democrats, meanwhile, pushed hard with lines of attack clearly aimed at damaging Trump himself, not necessarily digging into what happened in the 2016 elections.

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, one of the Senate's most staunchly liberal members, took Yates on a winding line of questioning that ended with Trump possibly appearing on the witness stand in a hypothetical court trial against Flynn. At the end of the hypothetical exercise, Blumenthal pressed Yates if that was even remotely possible.

Yates responded: ""Potentially.""

The Senate Russia investigators may have maintained the air of being the adults in Congress investigating Russia's interference. But the Senate Judiciary Committee has proved over the last two hearings (including last week's with Comey) that partisanship is still a powerful force in its own inquiry.

5. The media matters

Yates was fired by Trump one day after it came out that she had refused to defend his travel ban and four days after she first alerted McGahn about Flynn. Meanwhile, it took 18 days for the White House to fire Flynn after Yates first told McGahn about his FBI interview.",cnn
6,Latest on Afghanistan options expected to hit Trump's desk this week,"(CNN) The final proposals for a planned troop increase in Afghanistan are expected to cross President Donald Trump's desk this week.

US officials say the likely range for the US troop increase in Afghanistan is between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, but could be as low as 1,500. The increase would be to accelerate training missions for Afghan forces and well as to fight the Taliban.

Trump has already given authority to set official troop levels in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria to Secretary of Defense James Mattis.

National security adviser H.R. McMaster and Mattis favor the troop increase being discussed at the Pentagon and increasing the US's financial investment in Afghanistan, according to a source familiar with the discussions. The same source said Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and his small contingent of nationalists are expected to push back when those recommendations hit Trump's desk.

Additional strategy options being presented to Trump include an outline for dealing with the Taliban, including scaling up strikes against the militant group, according to two US officials familiar with the proposal. The proposed strategy will, however, maintain the Obama administration's push toward reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan government.

3,France: Paris Gare du Nord train station reopens after security alert,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Gare du Nord station is one of Paris' busiest transport hubs

The Gare du Nord train station in the French capital Paris has reopened after a security alert, officials say.

Platforms were evacuated and the area cordoned off by heavily armed police late on Monday evening.

No details have been given about the operation in one of Europe's busiest transport hubs. But local media report that police were looking for three suspects.

France is under a state of emergency since the Paris attacks of 2015.

Security had been stepped up across the country for the second round of the presidential election, which happened on Sunday.

Le Parisien newspaper (in French) said the operation focused on a train from Valenciennes, in northern France.

Police were looking for three men described as ""dangerous"" to French security forces by a foreign country, the newspaper said.

They had been spotted in Bordeaux and Marseille, as well as in Paris. Police had launched operations in each city, but had not managed to capture them, the report added.

Footage posted on social media showed many police vehicles guarding the perimeter of the station.

As a racial discrimination suit against Fox News Network expands, the network continues to shuffle executive ranks to try and get beyond a damaging sexual harassment crisis.

Two additional plaintiffs are joining a suit initially filed six weeks ago in the Bronx Supreme Court in New York against multiple parties, including the network, parent company 21st Century Fox, Fox News and Fox Business Executive Vice President Dianne Brandi, and Judith Slater, a former senior vice president and company controller.

The suit, which now includes 13 former and current Fox employees, alleges that the network engaged in ""systemic discrimination based on race, ethnicity and national origin."" The newest additions, Elizabeth Fernandez and Claudine McLeod, both worked in the accounts payable department, which Fernandez departed in 2014 and where McLeod continues to work.

The suit expands as Fox News looks to rebound from an advertiser boycott that led to Fox's April 19 dismissal of its star host Bill O'Reilly after reports of harassment allegations made against him. Last week came the resignation of network co-head Bill Shine, who had been mentioned in several lawsuits filed against Fox News for allowing a workplace culture in which sexual harassment and racial discrimination could develop.

At the time of Shine's departure, 21st Century Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch promoted Suzanne Scott and Jay Wallace, who like Scott joined Fox News in 1996, as division heads -- Scott of programming, Wallace of news. Jack Abernethy remains network co-president. He was named as co-president with Shine in August 2016, a month after Roger Ailes stepped down as CEO in the wake of accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination.

Last week, Amy Listerman became chief financial officer, a post she had held at Scripps Networks Interactive. And today, Murdoch announced that Marianne Gambelli would become Fox News’ president of advertising sales. Previously the chief investment officer at Horizon Media, Gambelli spent 22 years at NBC, most recently as NBCUniversal's president of sales and marketing.

O'Reilly's on-air replacement Tucker Carlson has managed to eliminate the crisis in the 8 p.m. ET hour. All of the commercial breaks have been restored for Tucker Carlson Tonight, Fox says, and all advertisers that left the hour have returned.

Two weeks ago, two-time Emmy Award winning and former co-host of Fox and Friends Kelly Wright joined the discrimination suit. Wright, who has been at Fox for 15 years, said in the suit, ""because he is Black ... has been effectively sidelined and asked to perform the role of a 'Jim Crow' – the racist caricature of a Black entertainer.""

Fernandez and McLeod allege they were ""subjected to numerous discriminatory comments and conduct by (the former controller) Slater."" Fernandez, who is Hispanic, said in the suit that when she was pregnant with her first son, Slater, during a meeting, asked ""if she knew the sex of the baby and if she planned on having more kids because 'Latinas like having a ton of kids'.""

McLeod, who is Panamanian and black, charges Slater with telling her “You people are high maintenance” in regards to health insurance costs and drive ""up everyone's ... premiums.""

Fox fired Slater on Feb. 28. “Fox News terminated Judy Slater before a single lawsuit or any amended complaint was filed,” the network said in a statement Monday.

Slater's attorney, Catherine Foti, said in a statement: “These are simply more baseless allegations.”

Former Miami Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti, a member of the undefeated 1972 team, has suffered falls, memory loss, and confusion, among other issues, according to a Sports Illustrated story to be published Tuesday.

Buoniconti played for 14 seasons, including seven with the Dolphins, and made eight Pro Bowls. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001.

“I feel lost,” Buoniconti told Sports Illustrated. “I feel like a child.”

Following his playing career, Buoniconti hosted Inside the NFL with former Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson from 1980-2001. After his son Marc was left paralyzed while making a tackle in a game for The Citadel, he started the The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis in 1985.

Sports Illustrated shared a preview of the full story in Peter King's Monday Morning Quarterback column on The MMQB. In the excerpt, Buoniconti, 76, said that “at 55 I was very normal. I’m not normal anymore.”

Even as recently as last November, Buoniconti served as emcee before a full house at a Legends Invitational dinner in California, according to Sports Illustrated. But he had trouble exiting the stage and called for his wife, Lynn, to assist him in the restroom.

Buoniconti also fell backward down some stairs and afterward told his wife, “I should just kill myself! It doesn’t matter!”

Buoniconti told the Miami Herald that he revealed the details of his current state ""... for all the guys who don't have a voice and are suffering like I'm suffering. It's not getting any better.""

“This has been my dad’s reality for a while now, and it’s been a frustrating and heartbreaking journey,"" Marc Buoniconti said in a statement. ""To see him like this after all he’s done to help others breaks my heart, and makes me want to do everything I can to find some answers for him and the countless other athletes dealing with these issues. We ask for your continued support as we try to help my father as he wages his courageous battle.”",usa-today

That’s a full-sprint, over-the-shoulder, backhand diving grab on the warning track on a ball cruising past him. Another couple of steps before the jump and his head is likely plowing into the wall.

It wasn’t a garbage time grab either — Cleveland had two runners on base in the sixth that surely would’ve scored had Pillar not hauled it in. Starter Marcus Stroman was quite pleased with Pillar’s effort.

A federal appeals court in Virginia on Monday grilled the Trump administration over its attempts to institute a travel ban against six majority-Muslim countries, repeatedly asking why it should ignore President Trump's vows to institute a ""Muslim ban"" that would violate the First Amendment.

The judges of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond listed statements Trump and his officials made before and after he became president and signed two versions of the travel ban that clearly said, or hinted at, a religious basis for the executive orders.

""Is there anything other than willful blindness that would prevent us from getting behind those statements?"" asked Judge Henry Floyd.

Judge James Wynn pointed to Trump's comments when he signed the first executive order, when he said, ""We all know what that means.""

""Don't we get to consider what was actually said here, and said very explicitly?"" Wynn said. ""There was sort of a wink and a nod.""

Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall responded that the second travel ban was revised to remove any mention of religion and a president needs to be able to act to defend the national security of the country, no matter what he said during the campaign.

""The statements were ambiguous,"" Wall said. ""The president clarified over time that what he was talking about were countries and territories that have known links to groups like ISIS (Islamic State) and al-Qaeda.""

The 13 appellate judges, who include 10 nominated by Democratic presidents, seemed likely to rule against Trump. They concluded the hearing without issuing a ruling, which could takes weeks to finalize.

But Monday's hearing exposed potential problems with arguments laid out by immigration advocacy groups that filed the lawsuit that could come back to haunt them if the case reaches the Supreme Court.

During the two-hour hearing, the three judges who were appointed by Republican presidents pressed Omar Jadwat, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, asking how long Trump would be hamstrung by his previous comments.

""How long does that taint last?"" asked Judge Albert Diaz.

Others asked how far back into Trump's history they can go to understand his intent when acting as president.

""Can we look at his college speeches? How about his speeches to businessmen about 20 years ago? Are we going to look at those, too?"" Judge Paul Niemeyer asked.

Judge Dennis Shedd asked what would happen if Trump apologized for his previous statements about Muslims and whether that would then allow him to institute his travel ban.

""What if he says I'm sorry every day for a year?"" Shedd asked, drawing laughter from the courtroom.

Jadwat said none of that mattered given the history of Trump's views in this case.

""It's possible that saying sorry isn't enough,"" he said. ""That's true in a lot of circumstances.""

Monday's hearing was part of the ongoing legal battle over Trump's attempts to temporarily suspend some portions of legal immigration to allow time to set up stronger vetting procedures.

The ban would block most immigration from six countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — from entering the U.S. for 90 days, and suspend the entire refugee program for 120 days. Critics say Trump's executive order is nothing more than the Muslim ban he promised during his presidential campaign.

His first order, signed Jan. 27, quickly spurred chaos at airports around the world. It set off a rush of lawsuits that culminated with a federal judge in Washington state issuing a nationwide ban seven days later. His ruling was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The Trump administration decided not to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court, opting to revoke the order and issue a new one.

A federal judge in Hawaii then blocked the revised travel ban just hours before it was set to go into effect March 16. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson ruled there was ""significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus"" toward Muslims in the revised order. The next day, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland issued another nationwide block on a section of the travel order.

The 4th Circuit judges are handling the ruling from Maryland, which was brought by several foreign-born people who are now U.S. citizens and green card holders. They fear their immediate relatives will be blocked from joining them under the travel ban. Next week, the 9th Circuit will hear oral arguments in the Hawaii case.

During Monday's hearing, judges also questioned the government about the status of its review of immigration vetting procedures. Why does the Trump administration continue insisting on 90- and 120-day travel suspensions, they asked, if it's already had so much time to improve vetting procedures? Judge Stephanie Thacker said the portion of Trump's order calling for a vetting review was in place for nearly two months.

""Was any vetting (review) done in those 50 days?"" she said.

Wall said government attorneys have interpreted court rulings as barring them from doing so.

""We've put our pens down,"" he said. ""We haven't done any work on it.""

If the nationwide blocks are upheld by either the 4th or 9th circuits, the case will likely end up before the Supreme Court, where Trump might have his best chance to implement the travel ban.

The high court, now at full strength with the addition of Trump's nominee, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, has divided in the past on immigration issues. Those 4-4 ties, which were commonplace following the death of Justice Atonin Scalia, could tilt in Trump's favor with Gorsuch on the bench.

Clapper said he was unaware of the FBI investigation into potential collusion

Washington (CNN) The White House responded to hours of Senate testimony Monday by saying there was still no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion, but also said he had been unaware of an FBI investigation into the matter until FBI Director James Comey announced it to the public at a House hearing in March.

Clapper previously made a similar comment in an interview on NBC . Pressed by Sen. Lindsey Graham if that claim was still accurate, Clapper said, ""It is.""

On the same matter, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said her answer would require revealing classified information and noted that Clapper had just said he was unaware of the FBI's investigation.

9,How to fix the Utah Jazz in three easy steps | FOX Sports,"Re-sign your big free agents (hopefully)

Like the Los Angeles Clippers team they beat in the first round, the Jazz have several important free agents they'll try to re-sign this summer.

Unlike the Clippers, Utah has every reason to believe they'll bring their squad back intact next season. Gordon Hayward could decide to go join Brad Stevens in Boston, but the Jazz can offer a much more lucrative five-year deal, while the Celtics are limited to just a four-year offer.

Assuming Hayward comes back, Utah should be in play for George Hill. Re-signing the veteran point guard won't be easy. He has a history of injuries, as we saw this season, but reportedly is looking for a max-level contract.

That might give the Jazz pause, and it should. Committing max money to an injury-prone point guard on the downswing of his career is the kind of decision that can sink your franchise.

So if Hill insists on the max, the Jazz probably have to let him go. If the market is softer than he thinks, or if he's willing to take a discount to stay with a young, competitive team, then we can play ball.

Replacing Hill would be difficult, especially with Utah right up against the cap should Hayward return. But the Jazz can't panic. They're too promising to risk their future.",fox-sports

16,Le Pen defeat makes Europe an attractive investment,"A television screen displays an image of France's President-elect Emmanuel Macron, as traders works on the trading floor of ETX Capital in London on May 8, 2017, following the result of France's presidential election. (AFP PHOTO / CHRIS J RATCLIFFE/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo: CHRIS J RATCLIFFE, AFP/Getty Images)

With political risk receding after the French presidential election, Wall Street pros say the time is right for investors to rediscover Europe as an investment destination.

The decisive victory of centrist Emmanuel Macron over anti-immigration, nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen shifts the focus away from fears of political tumult to Europe’s improving business conditions and investment opportunities, market strategists say. Macron’s win is a vote for European unity, raises hopes for economic reform and, perhaps more important, ends talk of France breaking away from the free-market European Union.

“The Macron victory takes a very big risk off the table,” says Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. “I am more optimistic on Europe as a place to invest.”

The investment story in Europe, which has been held hostage by concerns about the political future of both France and the EU, has turned more upbeat post-election, even though Macron must still build a political coalition after parliamentary elections in June if he is to get things done. Still, investors are back to making investment decisions based on things like earnings and growth.

And they like the numbers they are seeing.

The European economy, which grew at a faster pace than the U.S. in 2016, is expected to grow nearly 2% this year, Deutsche Bank says. And that improvement, clearly visible in an indicator of eurozone manufacturing health in April hitting its best level in six years, is leading to a revival in corporate profits. Companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 stock index are expected to increase earnings 14% in the first quarter of 2017, the fastest growth since late 2015, earnings tracker Thomson Reuters says. Full-year profit growth is estimated at close to 20%.

Putting money to work in European stocks makes more sense given that they are trading at less-expensive valuations than U.S. stocks, says Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multi-asset strategist at money-management firm BlackRock. Currently, European stocks are selling at 15 times earnings expected in the next four quarters, a 17% discount to large American stocks.

U.S. investors looking to profit from Europe’s recovery, can gain exposure to stocks headquartered in the eurozone in three ways:

• Invest in Europe-focused funds. U.S. investors can invest in broad baskets of European stocks via low-cost exchange traded funds. Examples include Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (VGK), SPDR Euro Stoxx 50 (FEZ) which invests in 50 of the eurozone’s largest companies, and iShares Europe ETF (IEV). Investors that want to bet solely on France’s stock market or Germany’s equity market can invest in country-specific funds.



• Buy European shares that trade in U.S. Active investors that want to make bets on specific-European companies can invest in ADR (American depositary receipt) shares, or foreign stocks that trade on U.S. stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Well-known ADR’s include telecom and wireless play Nokia (NDK), French drugmaker Sanofi S.A. (SNY), Italian eyewear maker Luxottica (LUX), Dutch food giant Unilever (UN) and Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NVS). Clemons cautions that investing in ADRs involves currency risk as the underlying assets you are investing in are in priced in euros. So, all things being equal, if the dollar strengthens vs. the euro, the value of your investment will fall; but if the euro gains vs. the dollar, your investment will rise in value.



• Buy U.S. stocks with strong sales in Europe. The broad S&P 500 index gets nearly 8% of total sales from Europe, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. But a handful of U.S. companies get a much larger share of their sales from Europe. Online travel site Priceline (PCLN) gets more than 70% of its sales from Europe and tobacco company Philip Morris does nearly 57% of sales there, according to data provided by Fundstrat Global Advisors. iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) gets more than 23% of sales from Europe while U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson gets nearly 22% of their sales there.

Investment dollars are expected to move back into Europe after Macron’s victory. Last year, European equity markets suffered $40 billion in outflows as investors tried to avoid political risk, Mateos y Lago says.

European stocks have a lot of potential to climb, as they have not enjoyed as big a rally as U.S. shares since the 2009 market low. The S&P 500, an index of large-company U.S. stocks, has rallied almost 255% since March 2009, vs. a gain of just 150% for the Stoxx Euro 600. Europe is also a little behind the U.S. when it comes to its economic recovery, which means “less positive news has priced into European markets, which gives them more room to run,” adds Chris Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets.

6,"The five fights Republicans will have on health care
The five fights Republican senators will have on health care","(CNN) Despite President Donald Trump's celebration in the White House Rose Garden last week, Republicans still have a long way to go before they can finally make good on their promise to dismantle Obamacare.

Passing a health care bill out of the House was the first step, but now the challenge of guiding a bill through the Senate -- where Republicans have an even slimmer majority -- begins. Republican senators have already said they will craft their own legislation and will use a process known as budget reconciliation to move it out of the upper chamber with 51 votes instead of 60, but that approach gives Majority Leader Mitch McConnell little room for error. Republicans can only afford two defections in their ranks.

Here are the five flash points you can expect as the Senate Republicans debate their way forward on health care:

Medicaid

Medicaid has long been in conservatives' crosshairs, but the benefit for states has been undeniable. Medicaid expansion has been a lifeline for constituents who suffer from mental illness or addiction and have been able to access treatment through the expansion.

Of the 52 Republicans in the Senate, 20 hail from states that expanded Medicaid in recent years.

Ohio's Rob Portman, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, West Virginia's Shelley Moore Capito and Colorado's Cory Gardner sent a letter to McConnell in March, when the House's bill was first released, expressing their concerns with the way the House bill handled Medicaid expansion.

The House's plan would end enhanced federal funding for Medicaid expansion in 2020. After that year, individuals on the program weren't kicked off, but once they cycled off the program, they weren't allowed to re-enroll. Essentially, the House's bill phased out Medicaid expansion over time.

The bill would also curtail federal support for the overall Medicaid program, giving states either a set amount of money per enrollee or a fixed block grant -- shifting the financial burden to the states.

JUST WATCHED Mulvaney: Health bill gives states control Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mulvaney: Health bill gives states control 00:49

Expect in the Senate that many of the lawmakers whose constituents have benefited from the Medicaid expansion will fight to keep the program intact longer. They will want to give individuals more time to transition off Medicaid and provide additional safety nets to ensure that people who may become ineligible for the program have another means to buy insurance. Meanwhile, expect Republicans who came from states that didn't expand Medicaid to argue that the program be phased out as soon as possible to save money.

Tax credits

One of the earliest controversies in the House's health care bill was the issue of tax credits. Conservatives argued the House's refundable tax credits were little more than a new entitlement program, a new name for the Obamacare subsidies Republicans had railed against for years. The similarities between the two -- Obamacare subsidies are also refundable tax credits -- prompted some lawmakers to dub the House plan ""Obamacare Lite.""

But more moderate Republicans argued that refundable tax credits in the House bill were inadequate -- largely because the tax credits were based on age, not income.

As CNN reported at the time when the Congressional Budget Office released its initial score of the House's bill, a 64-year-old making $26,500 would pay $1,700 for coverage in 2026 with Obamacare subsidies. But under House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan, that same person would pay $14,600 in premiums with the GOP tax credits.

In an attempt to lower the burden for low-income and older Americans, expect some GOP senators to push for some sort of means testing, which would take into consideration someone's income when calculating the size of their tax credit. In March, South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune, a member of leadership and a member of the health care working group, introduced a proposal along those lines targeted to boost the size of tax credits for lower income people.

Planned Parenthood

The House health care bill would defund Planned Parenthood for one year, a provision that could face increased scrutiny in the Senate where some moderate lawmakers like Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have already said they'd prefer to keep funding the women's health care provider.

""I, for one, do not believe that Planned Parenthood has any place in our deliberations on the Affordable Care Act,"" Murkowski told state lawmakers in Alaska in a speech earlier this year. ""Taxpayer dollars should never be used to pay for abortions, but I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health services that Planned Parenthood provides.""

Taking the provision out could alienate the Senate's conservatives who viewed the House's funding repeal as a major victory and are now feeling pressure from outside religious groups to keep the defund in the Senate's version of the bill.

Pre-existing conditions

One key Obamacare-era regulation that would be changed dramatically under the House's health care bill protects people with pre-existing conditions.

The promise of protecting people with pre-existing conditions was at the epicenter of Trump's own campaign stump speeches. But under the House's health care bill, states would be able to opt out of the community rating protection, which would allow insurers to base premiums based on a person's medical history. This would only apply to those who are not continuously insured.

Experts have argued that it could have major ramifications for people with pre-existing conditions.

Expect moderate Republicans to take a serious look at how to make sure that people with pre-existing conditions have additional safeguards as they craft their own bill. The messaging for Republicans has already been brutal as Democrats have very publicly argued that Republicans are gutting an overwhelmingly popular protection from the Affordable Care Act.

Essential Health Benefits

Under Obamacare, insurers are required to cover 10 key benefits for consumers. Those range from hospitalization to maternity care, but the House health care bill changes that. In an attempt to drive down premiums, the House's conservative Freedom Caucus insisted that states be able to opt out of the essential health benefits requirements.

Conservatives in the Senate are expected to push for even more robust insurance deregulation in an attempt to lower premiums. One idea being considered would give states an ""opt in"" rather than an ""opt out"" on key Obamacare-era regulations like requiring insurers cover the 10 essential health benefits.

But that could stir concerns from moderate senators who already fear that the GOP has gone too far to scale down insurance protections for consumers back home. Waiving the essential health benefits could hurt people with pre-existing conditions because insurers could opt not to cover their treatment. Also, it could make it harder for those dealing with substance abuse or mental health issues to get help.",cnn

""One week ago tonight, I made an emotional speech that was seen by millions, and as a result of my powerful words on that night, Republicans in Congress had second thoughts about repeal and replace, they realized that what is right is right, and I saved health insurance in the United States of America!"" Kimmel said at the start of his show. ""Oh, I didn't? I didn't save it? They voted against it anyway? I really need to pay more attention to the news.""

Last week on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" the host tearfully revealed that his son William Kimmel was born on April 21 with a serious heart issue. On Monday, Kimmel said his son was doing well.

""I want to tell you because so many people have asked, our son Billy is doing very well,"" Kimmel said. ""He's eating, He is getting bigger. He's sleeping well. He can read now, which they say is unusual.""

Last week's monologue prompted an outpouring of support but also some negative reactions on social networks and in the media. Kimmel fired back at outlets like the Washington Times, which ran the headline: ""Shut up Jimmy Kimmel, you elitist creep.""

""I can't even count the number of times I've been called an out of touch Hollywood elitist creep this week,"" Kimmel said. ""Which, I have to say, I kind of appreciate because when I was a kid, we had to drink powdered milk because we couldn't afford the liquid ... My dream was to become an out of touch Hollywood elitist, and I guess it came true.""

Kimmel then sarcastically apologized for suggesting that children in America should have health care: ""It was offensive, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.""

Following the updates on his son and reactions to his speech, Kimmel again touched on the politics of health care.

Kimmel also had Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy appear on Monday's show. Cassidy told CNN last week that he can only support a health care bill that passes the ""Jimmy Kimmel Test.""

(CNN) Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher said Monday that his fellow Republicans were ""irresponsible"" for celebrating the House's passage of the American Health Care Act at the White House.

""The Democrats were singing on the House floor, singing on the House floor after the vote,"" the GOP congressman said on ""The Jerry Bader Show ,"" a local Wisconsin radio program. ""They were celebrating the vote going forward because they feel like it allowed them to get an electoral advantage and, honestly, the Republicans who went to celebrate at the White House -- I disagree with that approach.""

6,GOP defends having no women in health care group,"Washington (CNN) Just hours after House Republicans managed to pass a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Senate is signaling it will write its own proposal -- announcing a group of 13 Republican members who will be responsible for crafting the Senate's plan.

All are male.

Senators in the group include Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, Health and Education Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander and conservatives Ted Cruz and Mike Lee.

A GOP aide defended the makeup of the group.

""We have no interest in playing the games of identity politics, that's not what this is about; it's about getting a job done,"" the aide said. ""We'll work with any member of any background who wants to pass a health reform bill that will reduce premiums and take away the burdens that Obamacare inflicted.

""To reduce this to gender, race or geography misses the more important point of the diverse segments of the conference the group represents on policy -- from members who support Medicaid expansion, to those opposed to it, to those who have called for long term full repeal,"" the aide added.

The announcement of the health care working group is yet another signal that the bill passed out of the House is merely a starting point for Senate Republicans, who have been saying for months that they had serious concerns about the House's efforts to repeal Obamacare ranging from how the House bill dealt with Medicaid to how it handled people with pre-existing conditions.

Even as the legislation was passing on the House floor, Senate Republicans were admonishing the House's efforts.

6,Trump sent 4 tweets on the Sally Yates hearing. Not one of them was entirely accurate.,"(CNN) Between 6:41 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. ET Monday night, President Donald Trump sent four tweets focused on the Senate subcommittee hearing on Russia's meddling into the 2016 election that featured testimony from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

The four-tweet barrage shows just how closely Trump is monitoring the ongoing congressional investigation into ties between members of his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian intelligence officials. The quartet of tweets is also a window into how Trump hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest . He creates his own reality for himself and his followers.

Let's break the tweets down one by one -- in the order that they were sent.

""Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is 'no evidence' of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.""

Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ""no evidence"" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

This is not entirely accurate. What Clapper said was not that he could definitively rule out collusion between elements of the Trump campaign and the Russians but rather that he was unaware of evidence suggesting there was any. In fact, Clapper noted that he had been unaware of the FBI investigation into the Russia ties with the Trump campaign -- driving home the point that he wasn't privy to every piece of information.

Trump is, broadly speaking, right that there is ""no evidence"" that has been released publicly of collusion between anyone on his campaign and the Russians. But that's not what Clapper said on Monday.

Tweet #2, 6:43 p.m.

""Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news!""

Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

This one is way off the mark. It is ""old news"" that Yates met with White House Counsel Don McGahn on January 26 to discuss Flynn's problem. But what's new is that she told McGahn on that day -- and in a follow-up meeting the next day -- that not only was Flynn lying to members of the presidential transition about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak but also that she had reason to believe he had been compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target. Yates also offered McGahn the chance to go through the evidence the Justice Department had that led them to that conclusion. (It's not clear if he actually did so.)

Tweet #3, 6:46 p.m.

""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?""

The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

Trump is, again, conflating two things. The ongoing investigations -- in Congress and by the FBI -- are aimed at understanding the extent to which (and how) Russia meddled in the US election. Whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia is certainly a possible strand in that investigation but it is not the entire investigation or even necessarily the center of it.

As for the idea of these investigations as a ""taxpayer-funded charade,"" consider this: A foreign power attempted to influence the outcome of a presidential election in the United States and, according to many in the national security world, will try to do so again (and again). Looking into how they did it -- and trying to prevent it from happening again -- doesn't feel like a ""charade"" to me.

Trump tweet #4, 6:50 p.m.

""Biggest story today between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report on this? #FakeNews!""

Biggest story today between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report on this? #FakeNews! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

Reasonable people can disagree about what the ""biggest"" story was coming out of the Yates/Clapper hearing. But, the idea that the surveillance story -- that the US government monitors foreign actors and could have swept up a conversation that person had with a Trump campaign official -- is a bigger deal than Russia having compromising information about the national security adviser doesn't pass the smell test for me.

I think it's absolutely worth trying to get to the bottom of how Yates came to know what she knew about Flynn and Russia and how that information got to The Washington Post. But, again, is that more important than finding out the depth of Russia's meddling in our presidential election and the extent of their contacts with Flynn and others within Trump's orbit? I think not.",cnn
6,Canadian journalist asked to leave 'Kushner family event' in China,"(CNN) After seeing advertisements for what was described as a ""Kushner event featuring Jared's sister,"" a Canadian reporter decided to attend. Then she was asked to leave.

At the event, Emily Rauhala , a Beijing-based correspondent for the Washington Post, was seated apart from her colleague, who faced similar resistance from the hosts.

""Some of her footage and audio was deleted by the event organizers on the Chinese side,"" she told Anderson Cooper on Monday evening.

""They actually deleted her recordings?"" Cooper asked his guest, who joined the program via Skype.

""That's right,"" Rauhala said, noting that while such a practice is ""inexcusable,"" it's ""also rather common in China when people get nervous about the press.""

During the event, Nicole Kushner Meyer, the sister of White House adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, mentioned her brother's new role in the administration while making a pitch to invest in her family's property. The New Jersey building makes use of an EB-5 visa program to draw in international investors, including the Chinese.

Kushner Companies later apologized for the name drop, and said it was not intended to be an 'attempt to lure investors' to one of its projects in New Jersey.

Though Kushner Meyer didn't directly connect the event to either her brother or the Trump administration while Rauhala was in the room, the Washington Post journalist told Cooper the message was clear.

""This was presented as a Kushner family event,"" she said. ""I later heard from another reporter -- who tweeted a picture -- that there was indeed a picture of President Trump ... on a slide that said 'key decision makers.'""

The event was meant to draw investors for 1 Journal Square, a $976.4 million residential and commercial project underway in New Jersey. The company says about 15% of it will be funded through the EB-5 program.

Who is Shirley Ballas?

Originally from Wallasey in the Wirral, she began dancing at the age of seven.

She won her first major Latin championship at 18 and had won all major titles worldwide by 23 with her partner Sammy Stopford.

Her dancing credentials

She moved to Houston, Texas, in 1983 and began to compete with new partner and husband, Corky.

They won their first professional Latin title in 1984 and continued undefeated for a further eight years in a row, making them the most successful Latin American Champions in USA history.

She moved back to the UK in 1990 to compete on the international circuit.

From 1995-96 Shirley and Corky were at their most successful, winning the Open British Professional Latin titles in both years - the most prestigious championship in the world of ballroom - plus all the major international events.

She retired from competitive dancing in 1996.

Her Dancing with the Stars connections

She became the guardian of Dancing with the Stars professional dancers Derek and Julianne Hough in 1998 when they moved to London to study at Italia Conti theatre school.

She trained Mark, Derek and Julianne, who all went on to win the Open British Championships in their age grades in Latin ballroom.

All three competed as professional dancers on Dancing with the Stars, with Julianne winning seasons four and five, Mark seasons six and eight, and Derek seasons seven, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 21. Julianne is now a permanent judge on the show.

3,South Korea presidency 'won by liberal Moon Jae-in',"Image copyright Reuters Image caption South Korea under Mr Moon is likely to overhaul its policy towards the North

South Korean voters have overwhelmingly chosen the liberal candidate Moon Jae-in as their next president, an exit poll suggests.

It put Mr Moon on 41.4%, with his nearest challenger, conservative Hong Joon-Pyo, on 23.3%.

Mr Moon favours greater dialogue with North Korea, in a change to current South Korean policy.

The early election was called after a corruption scandal led to the impeachment of the former president.

Park Geun-hye is accused of allowing a close friend to extort money from companies. She denies all wrongdoing.

If Mr Moon's victory is confirmed, he is likely to be sworn in on Wednesday.

The exit poll was conducted jointly by three network TV stations.

Change is coming: analysis by Stephen Evans, BBC News, Seoul

A Moon Jae-in presidency would represent a real shift in attitude towards North Korea. His policy is to increase contact with North Korea, in contrast to the tighter sanctions of the last ten years. He is unhappy about the deployment of a US anti-missile system on South Korean soil.

When Mr Moon was last in government, in the early 2000s, South Korea had a ""Sunshine Policy"" which meant co-operation with North Korea, a policy which was abandoned as North Korea tested nuclear weapons.

As policy in South Korea looks like shifting, many sceptics remain who think that no amount of talking to Kim Jong-un will persuade him to renounce either his despotic power or his nuclear ambitions.

For the last eight years, Seoul and Washington have been in lock-step over North Korea, with ever tighter sanctions and isolation. That is not Mr Moon's way. Is it Donald Trump's?

Who is Moon?

The son of refugees from North Korea, Mr Moon was jailed while a student in the 1970s for leading protests against military ruler Park Chung-hee - Ms Park's father.

Later, he served in South Korea's special forces before becoming a human rights lawyer.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Moon, pictured with his wife, has been there at key points in South Korea's history

Mr Moon, of the centre-left Democratic Party, unsuccessfully ran against Ms Park in 2012 elections.

He has positioned himself as the man who can move the country on from the scandals of Ms Park's era.

""I feel that not only my party and myself but also the people have been more desperate for a change of government,"" he said while casting his vote.

What are his policies?

Mr Moon has advocated greater dialogue with the North while maintaining pressure and sanctions, in contrast to Ms Park who cut almost all ties.

He has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Despite bad weather South Koreans gathered in Seoul to watch the results come in

But while tensions on the Korean peninsula ensured the election was closely watched, for South Koreans the priority has been corruption and the economy, with youth unemployment stubbornly high.

Mr Moon has talked of reforming South Korea's huge family-run conglomerates, known as chaebols, which dominate the domestic economy.",bbc-news
10,"iPhone 8 release date, news and rumors","Update: We've been hearing more good news about the iPhone 8 release date and fresh speculation that Apple will include AirPods in the box. Here's the latest iPhone 8 rumors.

Apple's iPhone 8 release date is expected to be less than five months from now, and we're already 3D Touch deep into new rumors about its 2017 smartphone.

It's the tenth anniversary of the iPhone and the design is due for big changes. We haven't seen a brand new look in three years, so prepare to be wowed.

The most immediate change may be to the name: iPhone 8, iPhone X or iPhone Edition, instead of just iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. This is a major refresh for Apple and its name deserves a giant leap.

Every iPhone 8 rumor really gives us a sense that Apple is overhauling its phone with at least one premium design – what we're calling the iPhone 8 – while also providing a basic specs bump for an iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus.

We're sorting through all of the rumors to deliver the facts and cut through the far-fetched speculation, from the always-changing release date theories to the all-important iPhone 8 price.

Slide down to unlock.

Read our in-depth reviews: iPhone 7 | iPhone 7 Plus

What is it? The 10th anniversary version of Apple's iPhone

The 10th anniversary version of Apple's iPhone When is it out? September 2017 or maybe a bit later this year

September 2017 or maybe a bit later this year What will it cost? More than the normal $649 (£599, AU$1,079)

iPhone 8 release date

Hottest leaks:

September 2017 launch for iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus

Slightly later October 2017 date the curved, all-screen iPhone 8

The iPhone 8 release date is the routine new iPhone rumor we expect to stay the same every year, but Apple may do something different here, too.

Apple has launched a new iPhone in September every year since the iPhone 5 in 2012. September iPhone launches have a pretty consistent track record.

iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus may still launch in September sporting a worthy, but ultimately predictable design and feature upgrade.

iPhone 8 may deviate from this plan by launching a little bit later (still before Christmas) with the biggest changes for Apple's smartphone in several years.

Why? iPhone 8 production is said to be running one to two months behind schedule – new tech takes time. This could mean delays or stock shortages.

We still expect Apple to have an iPhone launch event around September 8 and it could ship the 7S phones one week after CEO Tim Cook first holds them up in the air.

But it sounds like you'll have to wait – one or two extra months – for that snazzy iPhone 8's curved AMOLED display due to supply constraints, according to Bloomberg.

Can you wait until October or November? We're skeptical of all of the moving release dates, but we do keep hearing the disheartening rumor over and over, as there's evidence that Apple could be having issues with both the OLED display itself, and embedding a fingerprint scanner into it.

TechRadar's take: We keep hearing the disheartening rumor that Apple won't have the redesigned iPhone 8 ready at the same time as the still unconfirmed iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. You still expect a September launch event with all three phones present, but you may not be able to buy the the iPhone 8 (the phone you really want) until October.

iPhone 8 screen

Hottest leaks:

A curved AMOLED display

A 5.8-inch edge-to-edge screen

No home button and no bezel

The iPhone 8 screen may radically change in size and shape, and it's about time for something bigger and more stylish than the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus era display.

The big rumor is that the iPhone 8 is going to sport a curved AMOLED display instead of a the usual flat LCD panel, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

We've all seen curved AMOLED displays in the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the even bigger Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. iPhone 8's curve may be less dramatic, but still cooler looking than a completely flat phone.

There are other exciting benefits to an AMOLED display replacing the normal IPS LCD. It can deliver better contrast, more vibrant colors and include a battery-saving always-on display. It's also a better suited for VR and AR.

This has also more recently been rumored by sources, claiming that a curved AMOLED display is one of more than ten prototypes that Apple is considering - and that the phone could even have a higher-than-QHD resolution.

Who's going to help Apple push all of those extra pixels? Samsung is said to be supplying the OLED screens, beating out Sharp, which was once rumored for the job. Samsung may be able to deliver more curved screen in time, and Apple is said to have just put a curved screen order in with its long-time rival.

Just so it's clear: you might not see the fancy, new OLED display on every iPhone 2017 model due to supply issues. Thus, Apple may include it on just one iPhone 8 version.

Depending on how it all shakes out with Samsung, Apple is likely to reserve the AMOLED display for just the iPhone 8 Plus, or a separate higher-end 8 Plus Edition, luring you into buying the more phone instead of the smaller iPhone 8.

How big will the iPhone 8 screen size be? Rumors for this are all over the place, but everything says it'll be larger – around 5.8 inches, just like the Galaxy S8.

Don't worry. We expect a 4.7-inch iPhone 7S and 5.5-inch iPhone 7S Plus, but the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 is the hot new size with the curved AMOLED display.

It won't be too big. Apple can easily make the display size larger without actually making the phone dimensions any bigger. It's just a process of elimination.

There's been talk of axing the psychical home button and building the Touch ID fingerprint sensor into the screen itself, a rumor dates back almost two years.

Doing this would eliminate the otherwise useless bezel around the screen. ""The entire face will be the display,"" claims Apple blogger John Gruber.

""And the Touch ID sensor will be somehow embedded in the display. The front-facing camera will somehow be embedded in the display. The speaker, everything. All the sensors will somehow be behind the display.""

Credit: @VenyaGeskin1

We've seen how that might look in the leaked schematic above, apparently based on a prototype of the phone. Other leaked dummy models suggest that design is pretty close to being accurate.

An 'all-screen' display is the hot new trend launched by Chinese phone maker Xiaomi and its Mi Max, and came to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus.

An unearthed Apple patent also shows this idea in action, eliminating the phone's bezels in the process. Another patent has since emerged, showing a similar concept, so it's certainly something Apple's at least thinking about.

If Apple ditches the home button, it could replace it with a 'function area,' with virtual keys, similar to the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar, according to one report.

It's not far-fetched. Apple tweaked the home button with the iPhone 7, making it no longer physically click when pressed, so this could be the next step.

Apple's one hurdle is: can it reliably put the iPhone 8 fingerprint sensor behind glass? Samsung reportedly tried and failed to do this in time for the Galaxy S8. The alternative is to give the iPhone 8 a rear fingerprint sensor, a rumor that keeps popping up that nobody particularly cares for.

Apple currently uses Japan Display for many of its screens, and while Japan Display is planning to start building OLED panels they're not expected to arrive before 2018.

Probably not this year, but these patents suggest it'll come eventually

It's possible that just a higher-end model will have these new screen features, according to the latest supply chain sources.

This third, premium model is currently dubbed ""Ferrari"", and this model alone may have an embedded fingerprint scanner and an edge-to-edge OLED display.

Looking even further ahead we might see a flexible or even foldable iPhone, as Patently Apple has found a patent for just such a device, and more recently another similar patent has turned up, but this is likely a long way out yet – as in iPhone 10 or iPhone X territory.

TechRadar's take: The premium iPhone 8 is heavily favored to get a stunning, new 5.8-inch OLED display – if it can't source curved screens and glass. If it can build Touch ID right into the screen, that's ambitious and something Samsung couldn't pull off in time for the recent Galaxy S8 launch. Nobody wants a rear fingerprint sensor on the iPhone. Just don't expect these huge feats for the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus.

iPhone 8 design

Hottest leaks:

A curved glass back instead of aluminum

Smaller models may not change as much

Just when Apple has nearly perfected the aluminum unibody phone with the iPhone 7, it's now expected to be moving onto an all-glass design.

Yes, the tenth anniversary iPhone 8 is heavily rumored to debut a a curved glass back (echoing the front curved display), according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

The glass iPhone 8 rumor has since been given more weight, with the CEO of the company behind the iPhone's metal casing claiming one model of the phone ""will adopt glass casing next year.""

It would still require a metal frame apparently, which makes it sound a lot like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, especially if both panels are curved. That lines up with a claim from a source that's proved reliable in the past that Apple is experimenting with a ""glass sandwich design."" Delicious, right?

And yet another source also points to a glass back, with a stainless steel frame in place of the aluminum Apple currently uses in its phones.

That exact design can be seen in the images of a dummy device below, mocked up based on the supposed design of the handset.

Here's where the iPhone 8 rumors conflict: Right now, we're unsure if the design is being readied exclusively for the higher-end 5.8-inch iPhone 8 Plus, or if the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are also due for the glass upgrade, like Ming-Chi Kuo suggests.

It could be that the smaller iPhones designs will remain relatively unchanged other a new color.

The last major iPhone 8 design rumor is that the new phone could get a little more waterproof. It may jump from an IP67 to IP68 rating, notes The Investor.

TechRadar's take: Expect a big change to the design of the phone. It's too early to say if every new iPhone size will sport the curved glass look and extra waterproof features, but we think the days of an aluminum iPhone are numbered.

iPhone 8 camera and AR features

Hottest leaks:

A vertically-oriented dual-camera lens

Augmented reality features

3D cameras

The iPhone 8 camera ""can do extraordinary things,"" we fully expect Tim Cook to say on stage come September. ""We never thought it possible before today.""

Cook's ambitiously sounding words are almost inevitable. In his quarterly investor calls, he has become captivated with the idea of augmented reality (AR), or what Microsoft calls ""mixed reality,"" (so you should fully expect Apple to call it augmented reality instead).

What can Apple do with AR? You may be able to point your iPhone 8 at an object and have it recognized, claims one source “familiar with the matter.” The camera app may be able to recognize and manipulate faces in the future, too.

Let's give you a more concrete example (and source). Veteran Apple analyst Gene Munster thinks you'll be able to find your seats in a crowded stadium or the groceries you need among all of the aisles by looking at your phone.

AR is supposed to map out where you want to go, and combined with Apple Pay, it could be a big winner for the iPhone 8 on forward, according to Munster.

""Your phone slowly going away and being replaced by AR,"" he said in an interview with Cheddar. ""This is beyond Pokemon.""

AR may be the reason why we've seen allegedly leaked iPhone 8 schematics with a vertically aligned dual-lens camera on back. That may be AR's big change, and right now we're not quite sure why that is.

There's also talk from Korea that Apple is working with LG on a ""3D photographing"" module for the iPhone 8, which could be used to add three-dimensional effects and work with the rumored augmented reality features.

What about your everyday photography? That could be upgraded, too, with the second lens on the dual-lens iPhone 8 gaining optical image stabilization.

But don't expect a bump beyond the 12MP sweet spot that Apple and other phone manufacturers have found, and don't look for the dual-lens snapper to the standard iPhone 7S, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo . It's likely to once again be limited to this premium iPhone 8 Edition.

We don't expect much change from the front-facing camera resolution, as Apple just upped to 7MP iSight camera for the iPhone 7. But as selfie photos become increasingly important, it could include extra camera focusing tricks to make each and every pixel count.

TechRadar's take: Apple is giddy with excitement about the prospects of AR, and that may be the hot new camera feature going forward. We already got a big dual-lens camera upgrade last year. It may get better this year, but not be as dramatic of a change. Instead expect Apple to tout the benefits of augmented reality.

iPhone 8 battery

Hottest leaks:

Wireless charging – finally

Fast charging

Two batteries

Anyone with a smartphone knows one battery just isn't enough, which could be why Apple is rumored to be sticking two in the iPhone 8 for extended life.

Though that sounds a bit unlikely. What's more likely is that Apple might take on a stacked mainboard internal design for the iPhone 8, according to one analyst.

It may fill all of the saved space with additional battery capacity and also finally support wireless charging without that aluminum design blocking the transfer of energy (that's why glass and plastic phones can do wireless charging and metal phones do not).

Foxconn is reportedly looking into the tech for Apple and, after all, without the headphone jack, Apple is one step closer to being free of cables completely. This is surely the next step, even if there are some doubters about these plans.

Photo Credit: 9to5Mac.com

Apple might go beyond rivals and offer a truly wireless charger that works at up to 15ft, with no contact required between the device and the power source.

There's evidence that Apple has been looking into this tech, with Energous, the company behind it, supposedly working with a ""tier 1"" smartphone maker. It added that it's ""working with one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world"" and it will be shipping a product by the end of 2017.

Energous has also received a $10 million investment from Dialog Semiconductor, according to BGR, and Dialog just so happens to be a company that works primarily with Apple.

We've also heard from an analyst note, obtained by 9to5Mac, that all models of the iPhone 8 will have wireless charging - but it sounds like this will be standard rather than long-distance charging. Apple may also not include a wireless charger in the box.

Credit: Benjamin Geskin

A leaked schematic also shows a circle on the back of the iPhone 8, which is likely a wireless charging pad.

And when you plug the iPhone 8 in, you might not do so via a Lightning connector, with a report suggesting that Apple could swap that for a USB-C connection - though what's more likely is that Apple will simply use USB-C Power Delivery technology within a Lightning connector for faster charging.

TechRadar's take: Wireless charging and improved battery life are likely – but don't count on being able to charge from a distance, at least not on the iPhone 8. Apple may save this truly revolutionary for the iPhone 9 or iPhone 10, aka the iPhone X.

iPhone 8 internal specs and iOS 11

Hottest leaks:

3GB of RAM

A tiny 10nm A11 Fusion chipset

iPhone 8 is almost certainly going to transition us from iOS 10 to iOS 11, and undergo three months of beta testing following WWDC 2017 on June 5.

The internal iPhone 8 specs are also undoubtedly going to take another step forward with the Apple A11 chipset that's more powerful than the current A10.

What do iOS 11 and the A11 System on a Chip mean for iPhone 8? We may see finally Control Center customizations and Today menu widgets become refined.

iPhone 8 running iOS 11 is also likely to debut always-on screen settings (what will be displayed?) and an improved Mail app (hyperlinking text, finally?).

The new chipset, either called Apple A11 or Apple A11 Fusion, may stick with a quad-core processor since the iPhone 7 just launched with that.

Yes, octa-core processors is all the rage, but Apple has shied away from touting big numbers and instead focused on boosting performance. It's done just fine.

The same goes for RAM. It may stick with 2GB for the iPhone 8 and 3GB for the dual-camera iPhone 8 Plus. Of Apple's products, only the iPad Pro 12.9 has 4GB. Though an analyst rumor suggests all iPhone 8 models will have 3GB.

Perhaps the most convincing RAM claims come from another analyst, who argues that due to rising RAM costs the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7S Plus will have 3GB of RAM, while the iPhone 7S will have 2GB.

But the iPhone 8 may go for one smaller number: 10 nanometer. The move from the 16nm A10 Fusion to a 10nm A11 Fusion would make significant gains.

Qualcomm's 10nm Snapdragon 835 chip, for example, requires less energy and exhibits a performance boost on 16nm chips. Apple will want to rival this chip.

While Apple doesn't use Qualcomm's processor, it has used the San Diego firm's modem. But, as of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, it has dual sourced the modem: some from Intel (GSM-only models [AT&T, T-Mobile and almost every other carrier]) and others from Qualcomm (GSM+CDMA [Verizon and Sprint]).

There's an ongoing lawsuit between Apple and Qualcomm for overcharging of standard issue patents, so there's a chance iPhone 8 could ditch Qualcomm altogether.

Couple this with the fact that Intel just announced a CDMA-capable modem that makes it compatible with Verizon and Sprint in the US, and Qualcomm may have just exiled itself from the new iPhone for 2017.

Graphic chip partner Imagination Technologies is in the same boat soon. Apple informed the British GPU supplier – an Apple partner since the iPhone 1 – that it'll drop the firm's graphics chip from the iPhone and iPad in the next two years. So, it'll still be in the iPhone 8 and iPhone 9, but maybe not the iPhone X.

TechRadar's take: The iPhone 8 is naturally going to be faster, but its speed boost may be wrapped in another quad-core processor and coupled with 3GB or 2GB of RAM. A lot of the specs depend on whether or not Apple is ready to show us the power of VR and AR. iOS 11 is almost a given, and we fully expect Apple to continue to harness the power of developers for tools like Siri and menu customizations.

iPhone 8 other features

Hottest leaks:

An iris scanner

A Smart Connector

New sensing technology

Free AirPods?

It might not just be the screen you'll be interacting with on the iPhone 8, as Apple is also rumored to be working on a ""new sensing technology,"" which would allow the phone to respond when you touch any side of it. Theoretically that could be used for example to change the screen brightness by swiping along the edge, or take a picture by tapping it.

One other rumored feature of the iPhone 8 is an iris scanner, which wouldn't be much of a surprise given that the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 had one and Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus has the same.

Facial recognition of some kind is looking ever more likely, as it's been rumored again, and Apple's even acquired a company which works in that area.

One analyst has suggested Apple will bundle some free AirPods in with the premium iPhone 8 - that would be nice, but we'd recommend you don't hold your breath on that one.

The iPhone 8 might tighten up security in other ways too, as an Apple patent details a system that could get a thief's fingerprints and photo, as well as recording audio, video and their location.

We might also see a Smart Connector on the iPhone 8. This was rumored for inclusion on the iPhone 7 Pro – a phone which never launched, but with numerous pictures of a phone sporting the Connector it seems likely that Apple really was considering it, so the feature might be ready by next year.

We've already seen a Smart Connector on the iPad Pro, where it's primarily used to attach accessories, like keyboards.

Finally, there's some wishful thinking going on out there, with reports that say Apple is going to include free AirPods with the iPhone 8 – right in the box.

AirPods instead of wired EarPods using a Lightning or USB-C cable would be a huge perk for the premium iPhone 8 and help everyone get over the need to use an adapter.

TechRadar's take: The iPhone 8 might have an iris scanner, but only if Apple can make it fast to use. A Smart Connector is also a possibility, but seems a less useful fit than on an iPad Pro. Free AirPods seem like a longshot, but one we're hoping for after liking them so much as a standalone product.

iPhone 8 price

The iPhone 8 price may throw us for a curve ball come September since Apple is planning an all-new smartphone design. Here are the price rumors.

The smaller iPhone 7S could cost just as much as the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, running $649 in the US, £599 in the UK and AU$1,079 in Australia. That price really hasn't changed in the US, and it just recently went up in the UK (last year) and Australia (two years ago).

The iPhone 7S Plus price is also not expected to change based on the fact that the iPhone 7 Plus just saw a price hike (even in the US) to $769, £719 and AU$1,269. We don't need another price increase there.

Instead, Apple may launch an iPhone 8 Edition with a fancy curved display and an OLED panel (instead of LCD). That could send the bill of sale (for the parts) up 67%, and that expense may get passed onto you, the consumer.

The iPhone 8 price really depends on three things. Which version of the phone do you want? Is Apple releasing a third, more expensive edition with a fancy OLED display? And which storage capacities remain in 2017?

We've heard that the OLED model might come in just 64GB and 256GB varieties, but that 32GB isn't being killed off – the less desirable versions may get 32GB, 128GB and 256GB configurations.",techradar
10,Here's what the OS that could replace* Android and Chrome OS looks like,"Fuchsia, the mysterious new operating system from Google, has taken another step forward, lifting the veil on its user interface.

Screenshots have surfaced showing Fuchsia's UI so far, giving users and programmers alike their first real glance at Google's new OS, as reported by Ars Technica.

Unlike Chrome OS and Android, which are built on Linux kernel, Fuchsia is based on a Google-made microkernel called Magenta. According to Google programmers, Magenta's focus is on ""modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors.""

Though it's currently just speculation, it's possible that Fuchsia could be the beginning of a new software standard for Google-made products. The search giant is rumored to be trimming the edges on its operating systems, as seen by it bridging some apps between Android and Chrome OS last year.

As for Fuchsia, the new OS uses a current default system UI called Armadillo to build its layout and manage widgets. You can see how it compares visually to its Google-made kin in the images below:

From first glance, Fuchsia maintains similar notes to Chrome OS and Android, such as clear-cut widgets and a colorful palette for windows on apps and notifications. Also noticeable are entire sections of the interface dedicated to Google's search functions and suggested content.

However, you can get a better idea what sets Fuchsia apart when it's in motion, a such as in the video below, courtesy of Kyle Bradshaw of Hotfix.net:

To be clear, Google hasn't stated any plans to actively replace Android or Chrome OS at this time, nor has it given a timeframe for when we might see its experimental new OS make its way to consumer products (if at all.)

That said, as we near ever closer to the Google IO 2017 conference next week, we might be lucky enough to learn more about what the tech giant has planned for its latest creation. In the meantime, the open-source files are available via GitHub for any crafty coders looking to dive into Fuchsia for themselves.

10,Amazon Echo Show launched: everything you need to know,"Amazon has finally announced the Amazon Echo Show, the first Echo device equipped with a screen.

The Show follows in the footsteps of the recently announced Amazon Echo Look, which combined Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with a camera that can take pictures and make style recommendations.

The Show is a radical departure from previous Echo devices as it can provide you with information visually (via its screen) as well as through sound. Previous speakers were limited to using voice to communicate.

Cut to the chase

What is it? The newest entry in Amazon's voice activated line of Echo products

The newest entry in Amazon's voice activated line of Echo products How much will it cost? $230 (£220 / AU price tba)

$230 (£220 / AU price tba) When is it out? June 28

Amazon Echo Show release date

Confirming what was rumored earlier today due to a leak, Amazon has announced that the Amazon Echo Show will be released on June 28 in both the US and UK, with pre-orders open now.

That means you'll have to wait a month and a half to get your hands on the new speaker if you order it today, although it's nice to see it come simultaneously to both the US and UK, after the original Amazon Echo took over a year to arrive in the latter territory.

Amazon Echo Show features

As well as the Alexa voice assistant that we've grown familiar to thanks to its inclusion in existing Amazon Echo speakers and Amazon Fire TV devices, the Amazon Echo Show is equipped with both a screen and a webcam, which will allow it to both show, as well as tell, you information.

The screen is 7-inches in size, and is touchscreen enabled. It's capable of showing notifications, playing internet video, showing lyrics on Amazon Music, and it can also allow conversations between different devices in the same house.

It will be interesting to see whether this functionality is increased in the future to allow it to make voice calls outside of the home, as a pre-announcement leak from the WSJ suggested.

The screen can also be configured to show a live video feed from elsewhere in the house through compatible security cameras.

In addition to the screen, the Show is also equipped with a camera like the recently announced Amazon Echo Look. This is a device that Amazon is pitching as being a style-accessory, and which will analyse your clothes in order to make intelligent outfit suggestions.

This functionality will presumably also be making its way to the new Amazon Echo Show.

The Show is available in both Black and White colors.

As well as this new screen and camera-equipped functionality, the Show is compatible with Amazon's existing library of skills which ranges from ordering cabs with Uber, to controlling smart lightbulbs and thermostats, although existing skills will be audio-only until they are specifically made Show compatible.

The device is equipped with a total of eight microphones, which is one more than the existing Amazon Echo speaker. Given than the existing Echo is already pretty good at picking up our voice we're unsure why an extra microphone is needed, but it's a nice inclusion all the same.

Finally, the new device is equipped with Bluetooth, so even if your music app of choice isn't supported natively (such as Apple Music), you can still stream it to the Echo Show.

Pre-announcement leaks

We first heard rumors of the Amazon Echo Show a couple of months ago when Cnet reported that Amazon was planning on announcing a screen-equipped Echo device.

Allegedly the device, which we now know to be called the Amazon Echo Show, was planned for later in the year, but its release was pushed forward after fears that Google Home was progressing more quickly than expected.

Then, just a few days ago, AFTVnews discovered a low-resolution of the new device, codenamed the Echo 'Knight', on Amazon's servers. When they posted the discovery on Twitter, journalist Evan Blass responded with a much higher-resolution version of the same image.

@AFTVnews Here, let me help you with that. pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5, 2017

This week saw the leak of an announcement date of May 9, followed by a further leak of the price, release date, and name.

Between all these leaks, we've built up a pretty good idea of what the new device should be capable of, and most of them have now been confirmed by the official announcement.",techradar
10,12 top portable chargers: the best ways to charge your gear on the go,"Do you find your phone battery often dies before the end of the day? Then you should buy a portable charger so you can keep it pumped up with battery while on the go.

We've put together a selection of great portable power banks that you can get right now and we've listed them down below.

Whether you’re looking for a high capacity battery, slim design, lots of ports or something that can charge up both your phone and your laptop, we’ve got the great portable chargers you need to see.

Just want to charge your laptop? Check out the best portable laptop chargers

Best portable chargers for capacity

Anker PowerCore

A whole 20,100mAh to play with

HUGE battery size

High speed charging

Heavy

Doesn't support Qualcomm Quick Charge

You've likely heard of Anker, and this is one of the company's best portable chargers. It comes with a huge 20,100mAh battery inside, meaning this will be able to charge up your phone or tablet multiple times before it needs a recharge.

It also comes with high-speed charging for your devices if they use PowerIQ or VoltageBoost. It won't be able to use Qualcomm's QuickCharge technology, but it'll still boost your device when you're on the go.





AUKEY Power Bank

Charge two at a time

Large battery capacity

Two USB ports

Blocky design

No quick charging

If the Anker isn't right for you, our next choice is the Aukey 20,000mAh battery pack. It features two ports so you can charge both your phone and your tablet at the same time and also has a light to show you how much battery charge is leftover.

The blocky design may not be for everyone, but this portable charger should be able to charge your phone and other gadgets a few times over with such a high capacity cell inside.

RAVPower Portable charger

Bright with a large capacity

Bright color options

Compact design

Could be smaller

This is the cheapest option for a portable charger we have on the list, but this option from RAVPower should suit you for recharging your mobile phone while on the go.

It has a capacity of 6,700mAh, which should recharge your average smartphone at least once and maybe even twice. There are three color options here with the choices of either pink, bright blue or silver.

The LEDs on the side of the device also show you how much charge is left and there's fast-charging tech built-in too.

Best slim portable chargers

Iceworks 5000mAh Portable Charger

For those looking for something slimmer

Slim design

No need to bring cables

Short charging cables

Not suitable for USB-C

If you're looking for a slim charger you can slide into your bag's front pocket, this option from Iceworks is going to suit you nicely. There's no need to carry around a cable with this version, as the charging cables are built directly into the body.

Be warned, the Iceworks 5,000mAh charger will only work with micro USB (older Android devices) and Lightning (newer iPhone models) as there's no USB-C cable on here.

Poweradd Pilot 2GS

Metal and sleek

High capacity

Quick recharge

Still quite heavy

Poweradd also offers a great slim portable charger, and it's one of the cheapest options on this list yet boasts a substantial 10,000mAh cell inside.

It may be quite heavy, but this is only 1.3cm thick, making it a great device to slip into your back pocket when you're out and about. You'll want to grab a cable to go with it though as unlike the Iceworks choice above it doesn't come with one built in.

Lepow Portable External Battery Charger

A better design than the rest

Interesting design

Super portable

Takes a while to charge

The best looking device we've chosen is the Lepow portable charger. It comes in a variety of colors and can be easily slipped into your pocket, as it's much smaller than many options on this list.

You will need to make sure you have a cable with you to connect it up to your device, but it comes with a 5,000mAh battery inside, which is enough to charge up almost any smartphone at least once.

Best portable chargers with lots of ports

MAXOAK 50000mAh

A whole six ports

Six ports

Huge battery

Large design

This may not be the most portable charger on our list, but it features a lot of ports, so you can charge multiple devices at the same time. It'll even charge laptops as well as your phone and tablet.

You can charge six devices at once, and with a 50,000mAh capacity it has the juice to do that, so if you're usually surrounded by a lot of tech this is possibly one of the best chargers to buy.

Qi-infinity Upgraded 35,000mAh Powerbank

Huge in battery and size

Four ports

35,000mAh size

Large design

Doesn't work with all laptops

Looking for a another option with lots of ports on it? This may be a good choice for you, as there are four ports and you can charge up your MacBook as well as USB devices such as your phone.

There's a quick charge port too, which will fast charge compatible devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7.

ZeroLemon ToughJuice Rugged Portable Charger

One you can throw around

Four ports

Surprisingly portable

Not a huge capacity for the price

After a rugged charger that won't break if it takes a beating? The ZeroLemon ToughJuice pack could be a great choice for you, as it comes with a solid design that isn't too large to slip into your bag or even your back pocket.

It also features four USB ports, so you're able to charge a number of devices all at the same time.

Best portable chargers for laptops and phones

RAVPower Universal Power Bank Travel Charger

One for your laptop

AC output

20,100mAh capacity

Big design

RAVPower's portable charger is a great choice if you need a device that can charge both your laptop and your phone. It features USB-C and normal USB outputs as well as an AC output, so you can plug your laptop charger directly in.

There's also a 20,100mAh capacity battery inside, so this will be able to juice up your phone or tablet multiple times before you need to put it back on charge.

Poweradd Pilot Pro2

The white option

23,000mAh capacity

Easy to see display

Not particularly portable

The picture above may be deceptive, as this isn't a small charger and is capable of charging up your laptop or tablet as well as your phone simultaneously.

You can charge up to three devices at the same time and it comes with a 23,000mAh capacity, so it should last long enough between recharges.

Bestek Car Jump Starter

Something different

Huge capacity

Can jump start a car

Not very portable

The largest charger in this category (in terms of size, though not capacity) is also one of the most innovative, as this one can even jump start your car.

It features a huge 13,600mAh battery that can give your car that much needed jolt whenever you need it to, but also comes with various ports for your phone or laptop to charge as well.",techradar
16,Kimmel 'apologizes' for saying all children deserve health care,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel is firing back at critics who slammed his recent emotional health care plea about pre-existing conditions after he revealed his newborn son was born with a heart defect. Buzz60

Returning to the helm of his late-night show after taking time off to be with his newborn son, Jimmy Kimmel spoke about the viral speech he made a week ago that has racked up more than 10,000,000 views on YouTube.

The late night host explained to his audience last Monday that his son with his wife, Molly McNearney, who pens punchlines for his show, had open-heart surgery after being diagnosed with a congenital heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. At the time, Kimmel made a plea to maintain health insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.

""If your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make,"" he said last week. ""I think that's something, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that.""

Last night, Kimmel thanked viewers for their donations and messages of support. He said the influx of ""so much kindness (and) so much compassion"" was difficult to process but acknowledged ""there were also some not-so-nice things that people said online about me, including members of the media.”

He shared some examples with his audience. One biting headline read, ""Jimmy Kimmel’s obscene lies about kids and medical care."" Another: ""Shut up, Jimmy Kimmel, you elitist creep.""

Matt Damon's faux nemesis was able to make a joke out of the latter.

“I cannot count the number of times I’ve been called an ‘out of touch Hollywood elitist creep’ this week, which I have to say I kind of appreciate,"" Kimmel cracked, ""because when I was a kid, we had to drink the powdered milk because we couldn’t afford the liquid. Our orange juice came frozen out of a can. It would squeeze out.”

To his opposers, he offered a sarcastic mea culpa.

""I would like to apologize for saying that children in America should have health care,"" he stated. ""It was insensitive. It was offensive, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

""There are some very sick and sad people out there,"" Kimmel continued before calling out Newt Gingrich specifically. In a clip Kimmel showed, the former speaker of the house said, ""If you show up at a hospital with a brand new baby and the brand new baby has a heart problem, the doctors at that hospital will do everything they can to save the baby. They don't say, 'We'll take care of the baby right after you write a check.' They try to save the baby's life, and that's true across the board in this country.""

Kimmel said his statement was circumstantially factual.

""Yes, it is true that if you have an emergency, they will do an operation,"" he said. ""And that’s terrific if your baby’s health problems are all solved during that one visit. The only problem is that never, ever happens. We’ve had a dozen doctors appointments since our son had surgery. You’ve got a cardiologist, the pediatrician, surgeon, some kids need an ambulance to transport them. That doesn’t even count the parents who have to miss work for all this stuff. Those details, Newt forgot to mention. I don’t know if the double layers of Spanx are restricting the blood flow to his brain.”

The show host also addressed Gingrich's opinion that late night comedians “ain't funny ‘cause they’re too angry (at President Trump) to be funny.”

“Gee, I wonder why we’re so angry,"" Kimmel began. ""Maybe it has something to do with, I don’t know, you? Listen, Newt Gingrich does know a lot about comedy. This is the guy who helped lead the impeachment effort against Bill Clinton for trying to cover his up his affair while he was having an affair. That’s hilarious. Come on. Whatever you want to say about him. Thank you, Newt. There’s a reason he’s named after a lizard, and that was it.”

16,'American Idol' to return after 2-year break ... on ABC,"Original 'American Idol' judges Randy Jackson, left, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell returned for the series finale on Fox in 2016. (Photo: Matt Sayles, AP)

This ... is American Idol, on a new network.

The singing competition, which set ratings records over a storied 15-year run on Fox but was canceled last spring, is being resurrected on ABC.

The Disney-owned network confirmed the news early Tuesday, providing no details about judges, a host, timing or the duration of the series, though it's been speculated that a shortened season will begin next spring on Sunday nights. The show's previous seasons, about 20 weeks each, stretched from mid-January to mid-May.

TMZ first reported Idol producers FremantleMedia and 19 Entertainment's talks with ABC after earlier discussions with NBC ended.

As for who might be back?

TMZ says Ryan Seacrest, who joined the Disney family only last week as the new co-host of Live with Kelly!, ""seems interested"" in returning as host, though Seacrest Monday played coy on Live!, saying, ""I don't know if I can host it.""

If the show remains in Los Angeles, as expected, Seacrest would have to jet back and forth each week during live Idol episodes. But Live!'s previous co-host, Michael Strahan, did the same thing each week during NFL season, when he moonlighted as a host of Fox NFL Sunday in Los Angeles, though the weekend gig didn't pose as direct a conflict.

Simon Cowell, the judge who vaulted the show to fame, is now executive producer and a judge on NBC's America's Got Talent. NBC is also the new network home of fellow judge Jennifer Lopez, who has a major deal to produce and star in a new reality-competition series, World of Dance (premiering May 30) in addition to her current detective drama Shades of Blue.

Idol was the top-rated show for eight seasons of its run, peaking in its fifth with an average of more than 30 million viewers (and 36 million for its May performance finale). But by the end of its run, Idol drew only about one-third of that audience, even as the show's expenses — some judges were paid $15 million a season — skyrocketed. Fox announced a planned final season in 2015, and the show ended its run only last May, after NBC's The Voice had eclipsed it.

While ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey, in a statement, called Idol ""a pop-culture staple that left the air too soon,"" former executive producer Nigel Lythgoe expressed skepticism about the speedy return, telling Variety, ""it feels a little too soon to bring it back."" But ABC has been struggling on Sundays with dramas, ranks fourth among the major networks and with no NFL contract, can sorely use another reality hit. And all of the networks have struggled in recent attempts to launch new unscripted hits; NBC's Little Big Shots,which started strongly, already has faded in its second season.

Although ABC found success adapting two other British reality hits, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and Dancing with the Stars, it has failed in several attempts to clone Idol. Among the notorious bombs were The One: Making a Music Star, a costly summer series that opened with 3 million viewers and was canceled after two weeks in 2006; and Rising Star,which aired in 2014 and featured contestants singing behind partitions. But Idol has a built-in (if faded) fan base, and the reboot will likely be heavily promoted during ABC's Oscar telecast, typically the highest-rated entertainment program each year. Except for that time Idol beat it.

6,"Pentagon wants more troops, bombs for Afghanistan to counter Taliban","U.S. Marines salute during a handover ceremony at Leatherneck Camp in Lashkar Gah in the Afghan province of Helmand on April 29. US Marines returned to Afghanistan's volatile Helmand April 29, where American troops faced heated fighting until NATO's combat mission ended in 2014, as embattled Afghan security forces struggle to beat back the resurgent Taliban. The deployment of some 300 Marines to the poppy-growing southern province came one day after the militants announced the launch of their ""spring offensive"", and as the Trump administration seeks to craft a new strategy in Afghanistan. / AFP PHOTO / WAKIL KOHSARWAKIL KOHSAR/AFP/Getty Images ORIG FILE ID: AFP_NZ1SO (Photo: Wakil Kohsar, AFP/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is proposing to counter the resilient Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan by adding thousands more U.S. troops, putting them closer to combat and pounding militants with more airstrikes, according to a senior Defense official.

There are about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, down from the peak of 100,000 in 2010-'11. The request for at least 3,000 more American combat forces to bolster battered Afghan security forces was signaled earlier this year when the top U.S. commander there, Army Gen. John Nicholson, told the Senate the security situation had deteriorated.

The military's proposal, which requires White House approval, would allow U.S. troops to partner with Afghan forces closer to the fight, said the Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plan. U.S. troops in Afghanistan have dual responsibilities: advising Afghan security forces and a counter-terrorism mission against al Qaeda and Islamic State terrorists.

Late last month, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Kabul to hear directly from Nicholson. Mattis' visit came days after an attack by a Taliban-affiliated militant killed 140 Afghan troops, most of whom were unarmed in a mosque praying at their base.

Under the Obama administration, the Pentagon had been moving to end its presence in Afghanistan dating to 2001. Then, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, U.S. forces helped topple the Taliban government that had given shelter to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda terrorist organization.

But pleas from U.S. commanders about the tenuous security situation prompted President Barack Obama to reverse course and leave the current force in place. However, there have been restrictions on how close Americans could accompany Afghan forces in combat and on bombing Taliban targets. Those rules were eased last year, and the Pentagon's proposal would grant added authority for air strikes.

Watch the MOAB blast:

Mattis also learned on his trip from U.S. intelligence officials that the Taliban have been receiving increased munitions shipments, including machine guns, and funding from Russia. Nicholson also acknowledged reports of Russian assistance to the Taliban.

An added complication in Afghanistan is the presence of Islamic State fighters, known as ISIS-Khorasan, or ISIS-K. Nicholson attacked the insurgents with one of the largest conventional munitions in the U.S. arsenal, the Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or MOAB, also referred to as the Mother of All Bombs.

The U.S.-led coalition has killed more 538 Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan since March. The strikes have reduced ISIS strength from about 3,000 militants in 2015 to about 800 today, according to the military official.

The fight with ISIS-K claimed the lives of two U.S. Army Rangers late last month.

For those who think the original Oreo is too dull, Nabisco is offering $500,000 to the winner of its next Oreo flavor. (Photo: Nabisco)

For those who think original Oreos are too boring, Nabisco has announced the chocolate sandwich cookie's newest flavor: the Firework Oreo.

Cosmopolitan magazine describes it as “an Oreo with Pop Rocks in the creme."" It's not the real Pop Rocks carbonated candy that baby boomers grew up with — Pop Rocks were invented in 1956 — but red and blue sprinkles that the packaging describes as a popping candy.

Food & Wine magazine received an advance package of the cookies and had staffers try them.

""As it turns out, much like actual fireworks, they’re relatively enjoyable and kind of fun for while,"" writer Adam Campbell-Schmitt wrote. ""The Firework Oreos are basically your classic cream-filled cookie. There’s no real taste difference, just a slight gritty texture from the popping candies in the frosting although not as grainy as the sugar-laced Peeps Oreos from this Easter.""

The delayed reaction of the popping candy is a nice surprise, he wrote.

► February: Yup, Peeps-flavored Oreos are here

► 2015: Indiana woman's biscuit chip tastes like a million bucks

► 2014: Lay's brings back its create-a-flavor contest

But officials at the subsidiary of Mondelez International (MDLZ) also are taking a page from Lay's succession of Do Us a Flavor contests for limited-edition potato chips, announcing a $500,000 prize for its next Oreo flavor. The Oreo contest runs through July 14.

They'll be taking submissions through Twitter and Instagram using #MyOreoCreation and #Contest hashtags.

Some people couldn't wait to get started:

16,"'Dancing with the Stars': Bonner bows out, Normani dominates the night","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Everyone’s favorite cowboy Bonner Bolton saw his last ride. USA TODAY

Welcome back to Dancing with the Why Is Bonner Bolton Still Here?

Okay, that’s harsh, but guys. Here we are in this strange Dancing with the Stars final five that should probably have Nancy Kerrigan in it and definitely should have had Heather Morris, but we’re left with a seemingly predictable final three in Normani, Rashad and Simone. But for Bonner Bolton it was the final night of dancing. He tried, but his deficit stood out too much. As we hurl ourselves toward a new mirror ball champ, let’s review:

Normani Kordei and Valentin Chmerkovskiy (with Alan Bernstein)

Contemporary/Jive Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 40/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 39/40

Val chooses a song called Freedom for Normani because of past abuse she's experienced online — whatever pain she had to dip into paid off because her contemporary was as emotionally succinct as it was technically flawless. And it seemed everyone took note — Normani solidified a well-deserved perfect score for her Contemporary, and her Jive offered nothing less. If Normani loses this season, it’s a crime.

Saved you two weeks: @NormaniKordei is your #DWTS winner. No contest. pic.twitter.com/foeaOnqyCa — Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) May 9, 2017

Rashad Jennings and Emma Slater (with Witney Carson)

Jive/Argentine Tango Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 36/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 39/40

With this we get some insight into their connection, and it appears that Rashad is a real life angel! But as nice as he is, that jive wasn’t his best. Of course, there were staple kicks and flicks, and the first jump-over-and nearly-land-on-a dancer’s-head move, but it’s not his prime. However his Argentine Tango trio was FIRE with Emma and Witney. The footwork was nearly perfect, but the chemistry? It needs no comment.

Simone Biles and Sasha Farber (with Brittany Cherry)

Foxtrot/Paso Doble Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 36/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 36/40

To quote what my dad texted at me in all caps last week, “SIMONE WAS ROBED.” We assume that means “robbed,” but America agrees, and so does Sasha who chose What Makes You Beautiful for their Foxtrot this week. She continues to be technically perfect, however that Olympian emotional breakthrough? It doesn’t feel like it’s quite yet happened. But on that Paso Doble? Simone looks like a true champion, but the judges still say she’s too perfect.

David Ross and Lindsay Arnold (with Hayley Erbert)

Waltz/Paso Doble Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 36/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 29/40

So, God love Lindsay for choosing Humble and Kind for David because he’s, wait for it, humble and kind. But the moment of the season so far is Lindsay dancing on David’s actual feet. You see—David and Bonner’s main difference is that David has progressed. Does he deserve Simone’s score? Probably not. But he’s earned it. Does that make sense? Neither does this dance floor. On the final dance of the night, David’s gladiator inspired Paso to Gangsta’s Paraside, is surprisingly epic, yet adorably amateur. To quote David, “That stinks.”

Bonner Bolton and Sharna Burgess (with Britt Stewart)

Argentine Tango/Jazz Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 30/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 28/40

Sharna chose an Imagine Dragons song for Bonner because why should his run on DWTS start making sense now? On dance night, Bonner doesn’t particularly miss any steps, but there’s a fluidity that’s missing from his dancing that isn’t lining up with the other contestants. And Len even comments that he’s gone a week too far. DANG, LEN. On trio night, their CEO/sexual secretary gimmick feels weird... just a lot of money and side-butt and grinding.

Basically if Bonner stays this week he'd have to make up a margin almost double the biggest margin ever made up on #dwts — Claire Charness (@clairecharness) May 9, 2017

USA TODAY Sparkle Points Podium

David Ross: 5/5

We see you, David! Your muted lavender suit with rhinestones. Your sleeveless gladiator-dad realness.

9,The NBA playoffs are boring. That's not necessarily a bad thing. | FOX Sports,"It’s been 24 days since the start of the NBA playoffs and it’s 24 days until the NBA Finals begin on June 1, meaning we’re somehow only in the middle of the inexorable slog to the NBA Finals showdown. You know, the one everybody has been expecting and anticipating since the end of the last year’s postseason – Golden State vs. Cleveland.

That perceived inevitability of a Finals rematch has essentially spoiled any drama from the first three rounds. Highlights like Isaiah Thomas’s 53-point explosion are entirely isolated, standing almost no chance of having any greater meaning beyond that specific game on that specific night. It might as well be the regular season. There’s no future that doesn’t have LeBron facing off against the Warriors on the first night of June and because of that the NBA playoffs have nothing at stake, rendering the great moments irrelevant and creating a vacuum of hype that’ll continue for the rest of the month.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports

This is a common refrain – up there with “the playoffs are too long,” “the regular season is too long” and “how is that not a travel?” In both 2015 and 2016 the identical topic was discussed with some regularity. But this year, with two equally dominant teams relative to their conference, it’s on another level. Players are even weighing in, with Golden State’s Draymond Green complaining (for some reason) about the level of competition the Cavs have faced through their “boring” eight-for-eight playoff start.

“I thought [Cleveland opponents] would compete a little harder. […] I like to watch good basketball. When you watch them play, you only watching one side of good basketball. That’s kind of weak.”

Says the guy whose team just completed its own double sweep of the first and second rounds.

That doesn’t mean he’s wrong. Neither the Cavs nor Warriors have played an interesting game yet. The former is a -600 favorite to win the East while the latter is a staggering -1000 to win the West. Those are insane numbers. To put them into context, when the Patriots played the Browns last October, the money line was -550. It’s a sure thing.

It’s true that even without predetermined finals, the playoffs have been, by any measure, a snooze. Rockets-Thunder was far more fun to anticipate and theorize about than it was to watch. Celtics-Bulls had the makings of a classic until Rajon Rondo got hurt. Clippers-Jazz went seven but the finale was a complete dud for a series that lost everything off its fastball when Blake Griffin went down. Raptors-Bucks gave us a Giannis game or two … but to be honest I’ve all but forgotten it.

Not that there’s anything wrong with that. A boring first 48 days for a stellar Finals is a trade-off anyone would make. Excitement and upsets early lead to lower quality later. Consider the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament: On the first weekend, we love the surprises and Cinderella dancing her way to the Sweet 16. Bracket chaos is wanted and welcome. But then you get to the Sweet 16 and it’s Kansas vs. Middle Tennessee State and all of a sudden you’re retroactively wishing the first two rounds had been more chalk.

If the seemingly endless playoffs are setting the stage for the classic NBA Finals series we all expect, why risk the potential greatness of that series for the greatness of another one with far lower stakes? Who cares if Rockets-Spurs ends in an anticlimactic fashion as long as it doesn’t get in the way of Warriors-Cavs?

The ideal, I suppose, is getting high drama without affecting the endgame. If this were a script, you’d write the Warriors struggling early in the Western Conference Finals, playing shorthanded after Draymond Green makes history by simultaneously hitting two opponents in their respective groins at the same exact time and and, for a moment anyway, allowing for the dream of a monumental upset late in the series. In the East, the Wizards and Cavs could throw down like they did back from 2006-08, complete with battle raps, LeBron beefs and the reemergence of Gilbert Arenas. We’d still get Warriors-Cavs but at least there’d be some potholes and memories made along the way.

But this isn’t a movie and the reality is that the Warriors are going to win the West in four or five and either the Wizards or Celtics will be rewarded a moral victory if they can push LeBron to six. That’s fine. It’d be nicer to have some more excitement along the way or to have the ability to fast-forward through the beginning and middle to get to the end, yes, but playoff basketball is playoff basketball. It’s like pizza; even when it’s bad it’s not that bad. Instant gratification is overrated anyway.

The NBA Finals begin June 1. It’ll be worth the wait.",fox-sports

9,Ranking the best baseball towns in (North) America | FOX Sports,"This is not an easy list. How do you determine a great baseball town?

With attendance? Too simplistic.

By atmosphere? It's hard to get rowdy when your team isn't any good.

By scarcity? A one-sport town is going to have an advantage, but that doesn't mean it'll take it.

By jersey sales? You don't have to live in Chicago to have a Kris Bryant jersey.

It's an amalgamation of all of it, and it's an inexact science at best. But as someone who has been to all but a small handful of Major League parks (the two Pennsylvania yards, Citi Field, and the new Braves' suburban home) I feel marginally qualified (which is about as good as you can get) to amalgamate those things into an overall ranking.

It wasn't easy — not by a long shot — and it will probably offend the easily offended.

But this is the list.

So with apologies to Pittsburgh (a football town, first and foremost, then hockey), Seattle (a great place to see a game, but ultimately a Seahawks and outdoors town), Milwaukee (it's all about the Packers, even in the summer), Washington (not enough of a track record, but it's getting there), Minneapolis (great park, but it's clearly a Vikings' town), and Philadelphia (it's all about the Eagles, baby), here are the top 13 baseball towns in North America.",fox-sports

9,Sidney Crosby's post-concussion return is only getting more uncomfortable | FOX Sports,"Whether or not Sidney Crosby suffered another head injury during Monday night’s Game 6 in Pittsburgh remains up in the air.

What’s maybe more mysterious, though, is the way that the situation was handled.

During the first period, Crosby took a brutal headfirst spill into the boards and was slow to get up. He looked dazed when he finally got to his feet. Still, he finished his shift and played the rest of the game.

That’s not a credit to him being “a warrior” or glorifying his ability to play through it, something that’s often done in hockey. This…this was uncomfortable. Uncomfortable to watch, uncomfortable to follow, uncomfortable to think about.

At 29 years old, Crosby is already one of the best and most accomplished hockey players of this generation. He has two Stanley Cups, a Conn Smythe, two Hart Trophies, two Art Ross trophies, two Rocket Richard trophies, six NHL All-Star nods, two Olympic gold medals and a slew of other honors.

He also already has an unsettlingly long history of head injuries.",fox-sports
9,Why this summer's trade market could be even more intriguing than usual | FOX Sports,"So, what if the Blue Jays, Rangers and Giants really do stink and end up sellers at the non-waiver deadline?

A buyer’s market could emerge, one that could even include some of the rebuilding clubs as sneaky players.

The Braves already plan to act as buyers and sellers, and the Reds also would consider adding controllable pieces, according to major-league sources.

The Phillies, Brewers, Twins and Padres conceivably might take similar approaches, but an executive from one of those clubs says that July is not the best time for such teams to make significant upgrades.

“The July market tends to be more emotional than the offseason market,” the exec said. “So, it seems unlikely that an out-of-contention team would be the most motivated to swing a trade like that. Not impossible, but unlikely.”

Obviously, the performances of each club will help determine their strategies. The Reds, for example, probably would be more compelled to act if they remained in contention – unlikely, considering their 5.29 rotation ERA is the highest in the majors.

In any case, this will be a different market, if only because of the new rules regarding draft-pick compensation for free agents who reject qualifying offers and sign with new clubs.

Unlike in the past, only a revenue-sharing recipient will receive a pick immediately following the first round for such a player – and only if the free agent signs a contract for a total guarantee of $50 million or more.

All other circumstances will yield lower picks, reducing the incentive for teams that are out of contention to carry players to free agency; the better returns would come in trades.

The non-waiver deadline is nearly three months away. Teams will not get serious about trades until after the amateur draft, which runs from June 12 to 14. But things will be interesting. Things always are interesting.

The dynamics are different every year.

YANKEES FOR REAL?

Well, yeah, but offensive regression seems inevitable.

The Yankees rank first in the American League with a .317 batting average on balls in play; the major-league average is .292. Starlin Castro (.400 BABIP), Matt Holliday (.345) and Chase Headley (.342) are hitting into particularly good luck, while Aaron Judge, Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner also are a good bit above the league average.

Judge’s average exit velocity, which ranks fourth in the majors, helps produce a high BABIP, but as one rival exec puts it, “Every Yankee right now looks like his best self.”

I wouldn’t go that far – we’ve yet to see the best of Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius, both of whom missed significant time with injuries. But only six teams have outperformed their weighted on-base average to a greater extent than the Yankees, according to exit velocity/launch angle data on Statcast.

One also could argue that the Yankees’ rotation also is bound to regress, whether through injury, inconsistency or both. The team boasts numerous alternatives at Double-A and Triple-A, but Jordan Montgomery likely will face an innings restriction of some kind.

A trade for another starter almost certainly will be a consideration if the Yankees remain in contention.

HERE COME … THE MARINERS?

The Mariners, who have gone 13-9 since opening the season 2-8, might actually be in position to challenge the Astros once four significant players return from injuries.

Reliever Steve Cishek could be back this weekend, while right-hander Felix Hernandez, left-hander James Paxton and right fielder Mitch Haniger could return on the next homestand, which runs from May 15 to 21, general manager Jerry Dipoto said.

That’s the most optimistic scenario, assuming no setbacks. But the Mariners, despite their multitude of injuries, rank third in the AL in runs per game and fourth in rotation ERA. Their bullpen numbers are far less attractive, but part of that is due to poor performances by journeymen and youngsters who were pressed into unexpected duty.

The M’s, believe it or not, already have used 12 rookies, matching the Reds for the most in the majors. Two others, closer Edwin Diaz and left-hander Ariel Miranda, have less than one year of service.

“That is why I always refuted the idea that we had blown up the farm system,” said Dipoto, who made 13 trades involving 36 players during the offseason. “What we did is take the lower levels and turn it into the upper levels. Right now, it’s really benefiting us.”

Still, the Mariners’ start has been jarring, to say the least. In addition to the injuries, they’ve demoted two Opening Day starters, center fielder Leonys Martin and catcher Mike Zunino, and gone from Danny Valencia to Dan Vogelbach back to Valencia at first base.

Can the Mariners threaten the Astros?

I’ll believe it when I see it, but it’s not out of the question that the M’s will turn their season around.

Dipoto, while highly complimentary of the Astros, said, “If you lined up all the worst-case scenarios for us, they all hit … this guy’s hurt, that guy’s hurt, this guy under-performed.

“For the Astros, the opposite happened. They got the Cy Young version of Dallas Keuchel. Lance McCullers is really good. Their bullpen is terrific,” Dipoto continued, overlooking the Astros’ one significant injury, to righty Collin McHugh. “If their pitching is as good as we think it is – and I think it is excellent, particularly once they get into the middle of the game and can launch (Chris) Devenski and shorten the game up – it is particularly ominous.

“We’ve also seen Cleveland – they’ve got that dynamic bullpen. Those two teams are exceptional, we understand they are that good. But we can’t focus on anybody else in the situation we’re in. We’ve got to play day by day and hopefully hold our ground while these guys heal up. So far, we’ve been able to do that.”

THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE CUBS …

A team’s record in one-run games is not necessarily a reflection of its overall strength; most executives believe that luck plays a significant role in one-run decisions, with outcomes often dictated by a pitch here or a hit there.

A better measure of a team’s quality is how often it blows out an opponent, which brings us to the 2017 Cubs, who are 16-15 after 31 games as opposed to 25-6 a year ago.

The Cubs last season were an astonishing 42-13 in games decided by five or more runs. They finished the season with a run differential of plus-252, the highest in the majors since the 2001 Mariners were plus-300.

This season? Different story so far.

The Cubs’ run differential is only plus-10, and they’re 3-3 in games decided by five or more runs. The improvement of the Reds and Brewers also is tightening the NL Central. The Cubs, after going 50-25 against the Central last season, are 10-8 within the division thus far.

LET’S DREAM ABOUT THE REDS …

After all, it might be the last chance we get.

Seriously, what happens if this team patches together a rotation? It’s not out of the question – left-hander Brandon Finnegan and right-hander Homer Bailey could return in late June, righty Anthony DeSclafani in July.

The Reds, second in the NL only to the Nationals in runs per game, are proving they can hit, even though first baseman Joey Votto is their only regular with a lengthy track record.

Their bullpen – thanks to the dominance of righty Raisel Iglesias, emergence of lefty Wandy Peralta and creative usage by manager Bryan Price, among other reasons – has gone from the worst in the game to, at least thus far, one of the best in the NL.

Perhaps the most interesting development, though, is the performance of the Reds’ defense.

The Reds actually were quite good defensively last season, ranking seventh in the majors in converting balls in play into outs. This year, though, they are first, with shortstop Zack Cozart and third baseman Eugenio Suarez ranking among the leaders at their positions in defensive runs saved. (Suarez currently rates as the top third baseman, and second only to Cubs shortstop Addison Russell among all infielders).

Cozart, earning $5.325 million in his walk year, remains a prime candidate to be traded no matter where the Reds are in the standings. Second baseman Jose Peraza can move to short, enabling the Reds to promote second baseman Dilson Herrera from Triple-A.

AROUND THE HORN

*Infield defense remains a concern for the Diamondbacks, who rank 24th in the majors in converting balls in play into outs. Second baseman Brandon Drury, shortstop Chris Owings and third baseman Jake Lamb all rate as negatives in defensive runs saved.

All of those players, though, are 26-and-under, so it’s not as if improvement is out of the question. Drury, in particular, is relatively new to his position, and one club official compares his intensity and work ethic to that of an NHL captain.

Nick Ahmed is Gold Glove-caliber when he starts at short (he actually has played more innings at the position than Owings, who also has filled in at second while producing an .833 OPS). And Ketel Marte, who is playing well at Triple-A, could enter the middle-infield equation at some point this season.

*Good to see Rays shortstop Tim Beckham, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2008 draft, finally gain some traction in the majors while replacing the injured Matt Duffy.

Beckham’s on-base percentage is just .284, but his OPS is .766 in part due to his six home runs. He also has rated as a plus defensively.

Duffy is expected to return from left-heel surgery in late May. He almost certainly will not be ready to assume a full load immediately, and Beckham’s versatility should help him get continued playing time – he can play all four infield positions and left field.

*Cody Bellinger has electrified the Dodgers with his power and athleticism, raising questions about where he will play once first baseman Adrian Gonzalez returns from right elbow soreness – good questions for the club, obviously.

Right fielder Yasiel Puig remains his usual intriguing self – excellent defensively, inconsistent offensively. Puig’s groundball percentage is the highest of his career, and he has grounded into a major-league high 11 double plays.

9,"Exclusive: Hendrick engineer shares journey to NASCAR, working with Dale Earnhardt Jr. | FOX Sports","If you put in the work and put yourself in the right position, you can make your dreams a reality.

That’s exactly what Travis Peterson did. He went from being a young kid in Wisconsin who rooted for Dale Earnhardt Sr. to one of the main people in charge of setting up the No. 88 Chevrolet as a race engineer for Dale Earnhardt Jr. at Hendrick Motorsports.

After graduating from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Peterson made a connection with Greg Ives and became his race engineer on the No. 7 JR Motorsports Chevrolet driven by Regan Smith in 2013.

That was the first time he met his new boss, Dale Jr.

“It was really funny (the first time meeting Dale Jr.),” Peterson told FOXSports.com. “I was at JR Motorsports, a few days into working there and I was in the shop. He walked up to talk to someone I was working with and he goes ‘hey man, I don’t know you yet.’ I introduced myself and he says, ‘well, I’m Dale.’ And I thought, ‘I appreciate you giving me a full-blown introduction, but I know who you are. Your name is on the door.’”

Since entering the sport in 2013, Peterson has worked with Ives and Earnhardt, winning the XFINITY Series championship with Chase Elliott in 2014 and then moving up to the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series in 2015.

Through that time, Peterson has learned what it is that makes Earnhardt such a fan favorite.

“He’s just so normal. I think that’s what people see in him and why he’s a fan favorite and so many people like him,” Peterson told FOXSports.com “He’s a normal every day you and me type of guy. That’s the way he lives his life. He walks around the shop in a t-shirt every day and talks to people and sees how they are. That’s the way it still is. We cut up in the lounge and have a good time and he’s a fun guy to be around.”

Peterson always had aspirations to work in NASCAR but has to pinch himself sometimes when he’s working at Hendrick Motorsports with Dale Earnhardt Jr. and so many of NASCAR’s most well-respected people.

“It’s funny because my dad was a Dale Earnhardt fan and watching races with dad, I grew up a Dale Sr. fan,” Peterson told FOXSports.com. “It’s funny now to sit back and look at it in perspective. It’s kind of comical in a ‘how far we’ve come’ from a small town in Wisconsin to working with Dale Earnhardt Jr.”

Travis’ dad, Tom, works at Joe Gibbs Racing as a manual machinist and is a driving force behind Travis working in the sport.

“My dad was trying to get into the sport for a long time,” Peterson told FOXSports.com “He knew people at Richard Childress Racing and was trying to get a job there. That never panned out. We would travel to the races at least twice a year and go to the race and hang out. He was meeting people and trying to get in the door. When I was going into 8th grade, he got a job with Joe Gibbs Racing and moved to Charlotte.”

Peterson cheered when he got the news that his family was moving because his dad got a job in NASCAR and realized he had the chance to make his dream a reality, too.

At age 26, Peterson has accomplished a lot at a young age but feels like he belongs after slowly working his way into the industry with his dad.

“I slowly trickled into doing it all,” Peterson told FOXSports.com “I went from being a fan as a kid, then I went with my dad when I turned 18 and went to Darlington with him into the garage. He was on the No. 18 car (Kyle Busch) at the time and they won Darlington in the Indiana Jones paint scheme (2008) and I got to be in the pits and experience Victory Lane and go with him as often as I could. Then, doing internships and it slowly progressed to where it is now and it all seems so natural.”

9,Kevin Garnett explains why Ray Allen wasn’t invited on the Celtics’ reunion tour | FOX Sports,"It’s been known for some time now that Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and the rest of the NBA champion 2008 Celtics team aren’t crazy about Ray Allen. The rift began in 2012, when Allen left Boston to join LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade with the Heat, leaving one star-laden team for another.

The fact that the Heat knocked the Celtics out of the playoffs in back-to-back years before Allen left didn’t help.

Now, with several former Celtics players from the championship squad reuniting, everyone is asking about Allen’s whereabouts. The fact of the matter is he wasn’t invited to join his former teammates on a “reunion tour,” of sorts, and Kevin Garnett explained Monday night why that is.

“Everybody’s asking us, ‘Where’s Ray?’” Garnett said on his TNT segment, “Area 21.” “People don’t understand that this is real life for us, and the situation with Ray is very sensitive. I think when we all talked about doing this reunion tour, we talked about guys we consider loyal and part of this group. Just being honest, my two cents, man, when Ray decided to go to the Heat, I felt like he moved on. And he went to pursue another ring, and he got another ring. Shout out to him. And that’s it. It wasn’t no other Wizards, it wasn’t no other Spurs, it wasn’t no other Heat … it was all Celtics invited to this.”

“It was more than basketball for us… It felt like a sour breakup.” Pierce, KG, Rondo, Big Baby & Perk share their thoughts on Ray Allen. pic.twitter.com/8JYRWmxm0i — KG's Area 21 (@KGArea21) May 9, 2017

Is that a reasonable explanation? People will have different opinions, but it seems a bit unfair for the Celtics to completely exclude Allen, considering what happened in the years after he left.

Garnett and Paul Pierce were traded to the Nets one year after Allen joined the Heat, hoping to recreate what they had with the Celtics in Brooklyn. That lasted only a year before Pierce signed with the Wizards and Garnett was traded to the Timberwolves during the 2014-15 season.

So the “band” could have stuck together longer if Allen had stayed, but the Celtics were disassembled one year after his departure anyway.

“I was initially hurt by the whole way everything went down,” Pierce said. “Like, I don’t have no beef with none of my teammates or nothing. I was just hurt [by] how it went down.

“We all came together, we talked about it, we talked every day, we hung out all the time. And then when it was time for free agency – and to each his own in free agency – but I thought we formed a brotherhood here in Boston and just how we carried ourselves not only on the court but off it. … That’s what I was hurt by, when Ray didn’t just at least give us a heads up about it.”

AP

Pierce continued by saying “now it’s uncomfortable” and that he hasn’t talked to Allen in years. And don’t expect Garnett, Pierce or Kendrick Perkins to be the first to try to mend fences.

“At this point in time, I don’t think it’s on nobody on here to break the ice. I actually think it’s on Ray to break the ice,” Perkins said. “If Ray want to make amends with anybody up here, or whatever the case, I think it’s on him to reach out and say, ‘Hey, P, I handled this wrong. We better than this.’ ‘Hey, Ticket, I handled this wrong.’ ‘Hey, Big Baby, I handled this wrong.’ ‘Hey Rondo, I handled this wrong.’ And just get it past us. We won games together.”

We may never see the trio of Garnett, Pierce and Allen together again, which is a bit disappointing because they were so much fun to watch when they brought the Celtics their last championship.",fox-sports

NBC’s Jeremy Roenick was one of the few to address it bluntly, saying: “It’s a big demotion. If I’m him … if I’m going down to the third line, I’m going to be out of my mind — irate and mad.”

To me, at least, it’s the most fascinating story of the postseason. Alex Ovechkin, a true superstar, one of the most important NHL figures over the last decade and a half, was told to put on a white shirt at practice, the shirt designated for the third liners, and to do so for the lead-up to two do-or-die games for the franchise which he is the face of … and he didn’t quit.

9,Does Ryan Howard's Triple-A release signal the end for the former MVP? | FOX Sports,"Ryan Howard is a free agent once again after having been released from his minor-league contract with the Atlanta Braves.

Howard was hitting .184/238/.263 with a homer, five RBI and 11 strikeouts in 42 plate appearances for the Braves’ Triple-A affiliate in Gwinnett. He had hoped to hit well enough to earn a spot as a left-handed bat on the bench for Atlanta, but now the 37-year-old slugger must contemplate his options, which could include retirement.

After spending his entire career with the Phillies – 13 seasons in the majors after being drafted in the fifth round by Philadelphia in 2001 – Howard didn’t attract much attention on the free-agent market this past offseason. He eventually settled for a minor-league deal with the Braves in early April.

The 2005 NL Rookie of the Year and 2006 NL MVP is a career .258/.343/.515 hitter with 382 homers and 1,194 RBI. In his final season in Philly in 2016, he hit just .196/.257/.453 with 25 homers and 59 RBI in 112 games.

6,Watch: Sally Yates and Ted Cruz go head-to-head on Trump's travel ban,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share When Ted Cruz questioned former acting Attorney General Sally Yates for not supporting Donald Trump's temporary travel ban, she was ready to defend her position. USA TODAY

Former acting attorney general Sally Yates and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went head-to-head into a heated exchanged over the President’s travel ban Monday.

Yates was fired as acting attorney general for refusing to carry out the President’s first iteration of a travel ban in January. During a Senate hearing on Monday, Cruz questioned Yates over her refusal to carry out the president’s travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Cruz read a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president the power to bar immigrants from the country if it’s in the best interest of the country.

“Would you agree that is broad statutory authorization,” Cruz asked.

Yates fired back that she was familiar with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and spouted out another statue.

“I am also familiar with an additional provision of the INA, that says no person shall receive preference or be discriminated against in issuance of a visa because of race, nationality or place of birth,” she said. “That I believe was promulgated after the statue you just quoted and that’s been part of the discussion with the courts, with respect to the INA, was whether this more specific statue trumps the first one you just described.”

Yates said her original concern was not over the Immigration and Nationality Act, but whether the president’s executive order violated the Constitution.

“But my concern was not an INA concern here; it rather was a constitutional concern whether or not ... the executive order here violated the Constitution specifically with the establishment clause and equal protection and due process,"" she said.

More coverage:

Yates also claimed that the Office of Legal Counsel, the Justice Department office that advises the president on legal matters and had previously approved Trump’s order, was specifically instructed not share its deliberations with Yates and other interim Justice leadership before the travel ban was made public.

She did not detail who instructed the OLC not to share its views with her and other top Justice officials.

""Not only were we not consulted, we weren't even told about it,'' Yates told Cruz.

Yates said she was “not convinced that [the travel ban] was lawful.”

It's taken two solid weeks for Shepard Smith's comments about his homosexuality at the University of Mississippi to get national pickup, but in a way, that's fitting for a man who, for the last decade, never really saw himself as being in the closet.

Smith addressed the elephant in the Fox newsroom during an April 21 speech at Ole Miss' Meek School of Journalism, where he was once a student. Sitting in the audience: his father, stepfather and his partner.

The Holly Springs, Miss., native said that for his college years and the first two decades of his career, he didn't hide his sexuality so much as he just steered clear of the issue entirely. He poured himself into his work because he was unprepared to deal with the consequences.

“A. You’re going to hell for it,” he said, listing the reasons he avoided the subject. “B. You’ll never have any friends again. C. What are you going to tell your family? And by the way, you’re on television on the craziest conservative network on Earth,” he joked.”That will probably put you in front of a brick wall. Of course, none of that was true, but that’s how it felt.”

That, he explained, was ""why it wasn’t until seven, or eight, or nine years ago, I started living my truth ... And when I told the truth, I guess it was considered that I outed myself. I didn’t even think about it because I didn’t think I was in.”

Things did get better after that point.

""Once I figured it all out, I wasn’t hiding anything,"" he told the audience. ""I was always as true to me as I knew how to be. If I was fibbing to you, it’s because I was fibbing to me. And I didn’t realize I was fibbing to you because I didn’t know I was fibbing to me. And I know that sounds like such a load of (expletive), but it really is my truth. And I don’t have to fib about anything ever again as long as I live and that really makes everything so much easier.”

For Smith, his sexuality is both important and a non-issue.

“I don’t think about it,” he said. “It’s not a thing. I go to work. I manage a lot of people. I cover the news. I deal with holy hell around me. I go home to the man I’m in love with.""

But don't go assigning any gay stereotypes to him, warns the Ole Miss fans.

""On a Saturday, I don't (care) about brunch,"" he laughed. ""I respect you and your brunch. You should enjoy the brunch. The drag queens will be great. I'll be at (Ole Miss') Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. Because that's where I need to be. And later, I need to watch ESPN for the rest of the day ... But it's harder when you like boys to find other people to roll like this. Until you put them on a private jet and bring them here.""

6,Comey's claim to Congress about Clinton aide's emails wasn't true,"Story highlights The emails were forwarded to Anthony Weiner's computer via a backup system for Abedin's phone

The discovery of the emails last October prompted Comey to alert Congress

Washington (CNN) FBI Director James Comey erroneously told Congress last week that former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails to her husband's laptop -- and the bureau is looking for a way to clean up the error, according to officials familiar with the matter.

The emails were forwarded to Anthony Weiner's computer via a backup system for her phone, US officials told CNN last fall. Some, though far fewer than the ""hundreds and thousands"" Comey described, may have been sent in order to be printed, the officials say.

The emails weren't marked as classified, though the FBI later found classified information contained in some emails recovered from Weiner's laptop. The discovery of the emails last October prompted Comey to alert Congress, days before the presidential election, that the FBI had reopened its probe of Clinton's private email server.

Some Democrats and Clinton herself have blamed her election loss at least partly on Comey's decision to update Congress about the newly found emails. The FBI ended its investigation of the emails without changing its conclusion that no charges should be brought against Clinton or anyone else.

Nick Merrill, a spokesman for the former secretary of state, compared Comey's statements to Clinton's marathon testimony at a 2015 hearing over the Benghazi terrorist attacks.

6,Comey hearing: FBI chief questioned on Russia,"(CNN) FBI Director James Comey strongly defended Wednesday his decision to alert Congress just days before the 2016 election about his agency's investigation into emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton's personal server, telling senators while the idea of impacting the election made him ""mildly nauseous,"" he would not change what he did.

""It was a hard choice, I still believe in retrospect the right choice,"" Comey told senators at a judiciary committee hearing on oversight of his agency . ""I can't consider for a second whose political fortunes will be affected.""

Comey faced sharp questions from both sides of the aisle and is testifying the day after both the sitting US President and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee sharply criticized him for his role in the outcome of last year's presidential election.

He also said Russia to this day is actively involved in trying to influence US politics, emboldened after the outcome of last year's election.

""I think one of the lessons that the Russians may have drawn from this is: this works,"" Comey said.

Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley originally called the Wednesday oversight hearing of the FBI to examine what the agency knows about a 2015 terrorist attack in Garland, Texas . But the broad oversight hearing almost immediately shifted to the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the US elections, a subject on which there are four congressional probes in progress that have led to a steady stream of revelations since President Donald Trump was elected.

Comey has become an almost equally divisive figure for Republicans and Democrats for his impact on the 2016 elections.

""A cloud of doubt hangs over the FBI's objectivity,"" Grassley said in his opening remarks, which listed a series of issues he took with the agency. The Iowa Republican added later, ""The public's faith in the FBI, Congress, and our democratic process has been tested lately.""

Comey cited the meeting on the tarmac between former President Bill Clinton and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch last year as a sign he was worried about leadership at the Justice Department's handling of its investigation.

""I'm not picking on the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, who I like very much, but her meeting with President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for me and I then said, you know what, the department cannot, by itself, credibly end this,"" Comey told the committee.

Comey's revelation that the FBI was examining additional emails from Hillary Clinton that were discovered on disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner's computer, has led Democrats -- including Clinton herself -- to say it cost them the White House.

""I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off,"" the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said Tuesday in an interview conducted by CNN's Christiane Amanpour at the Women for Women International summit in New York.

Ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein used her first remarks to question the agency's timing and handling the Clinton investigation.

""Why didn't you just do the investigation as you would normally, with no public announcement?"" the California Democrat asked.

""Having repeatedly told this Congress we're done and there's nothing there, there's no case there, there's no case there, to restart in a hugely significant way, potentially finding the emails that would reflect on her intent from the beginning and not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view,"" Comey responded as part of his lengthy answer explaining his letter to Congress.

Most recently, CNN reported Tuesday that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is prepared to testify before a Senate panel next week that she gave a forceful warning to the White House regarding then-national security adviser Michael Flynn and his conversations with the Russians nearly three weeks before he was fired, contradicting the administration's version of events. Comey, responding to a question Wednesday from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, confirmed Yates discussed her assessment that Flynn may be vulnerable with him.

Following those remarks, Trump criticized Comey the night before the hearing.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony......Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?"" Trump said in a pair of tweets Tuesday.

Senate Democrats grilled the FBI chief about his decisions in the final days of the US election last year and his timing for releasing that information.

""The most important investigation the FBI is currently conducting is into Russia's interference in our last presidential election,"" Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, told CNN Tuesday. ""This isn't just about understanding Russian interference and potential coordination of some kind with the Trump campaign. This is about defending our next election as well.""

Meanwhile, Graham, who is leading his own investigation into Russia's interference in the election, said he still wants Comey to answer whether the FBI issued any warrants against the Trump campaign -- a question he asked months ago.

""I just want an answer. I just want to know what is going on here,"" Graham said Tuesday. ""You had (former Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper say there was no surveillance of the Trump campaign or Trump Tower. You've got press reports a FISA warrant was issued for Carter Page because of his ties to Russia. I just want to know what happened. And if we can't do it in an open session, let's do it in a closed session.""",cnn
6,Senator: FBI Director Comey 'as popular as cholera',"(CNN) In his typical colorful language, Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy described FBI Director James Comey's social standing in Washington as ""about as popular as cholera.""

""It's no secret Comey doesn't get invited to many parties on Capitol Hill,"" the Republican senator said on CNN's ""New Day"" Thursday morning, a day after Comey testified on Capitol Hill about his agency's probe into alleged links between the Trump campaign and the Russians. ""He's about as popular as cholera. I respect that about him. The impression I get of Comey is he's going to do his job and he doesn't care who gets mad at him.""

Comey is set to appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday for a second round of testimony, this time behind closed doors -- after weeks of wrangling that almost knocked the House Russia investigation off-track.

""I appreciated Comey's candor,"" said Kennedy. ""He was forthcoming. He wasn't apologetic.""

Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers will brief the panel Thursday in a closed hearing that both Republicans and Democrats hope will result in more answers.

They responded to Clinton's comments throughout the day

(CNN) President Donald Trump, in a series of late night tweets on Tuesday, both revisited his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton and seemingly slammed the judgment of his own FBI director.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign,"" Trump wrote in a series of messages.

...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2017

The tweets come after Clinton blamed her flawed candidacy, Russia's intervention in the election via WikiLeaks and a letter released by FBI Director James Comey for her 2016 election loss during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a Women for Women International event in New York.

Comey will appear before a Senate committee Wednesday, where he'll face questions on Russian interference in the US election and why he decided to announce that the FBI was looking again at Clinton's emails just days before the election.

Hours before Trump tweeted, Clinton welcomed the President's ire after Amanpour predicted that the Twitter-focused President would respond to his former opponent.

3,Moon Jae-in: South Korean liberal claims presidency win,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption South Korea under Mr Moon is likely to overhaul its policy towards the North

Liberal candidate Moon Jae-in has claimed victory in South Korea's presidential election.

Mr Moon favours greater dialogue with North Korea, in a change to current South Korean policy.

""I will be president for all South Koreans,"" he told cheering supporters in Gwanghwamun Square in the capital Seoul.

The early election was called after a corruption scandal led to the impeachment of the former president.

Official results have yet to be released.

An exit poll conducted jointly by three network TV stations had put him on course to get 41.4% of the vote, with his nearest challenger, conservative Hong Joon-Pyo, on 23.3%.

Park Geun-hye is accused of allowing a close friend to extort money from companies. She denies all wrongdoing.

Mr Moon is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday.

Change is coming: analysis by Stephen Evans, BBC News, Seoul

A Moon Jae-in presidency would represent a real shift in attitude towards North Korea. His policy is to increase contact with North Korea, in contrast to the tighter sanctions of the last ten years. He is unhappy about the deployment of a US anti-missile system on South Korean soil.

When Mr Moon was last in government, in the early 2000s, South Korea had a ""Sunshine Policy"" which meant co-operation with North Korea, a policy which was abandoned as North Korea tested nuclear weapons.

As policy in South Korea looks like shifting, many sceptics remain who think that no amount of talking to Kim Jong-un will persuade him to renounce either his despotic power or his nuclear ambitions.

For the last eight years, Seoul and Washington have been in lock-step over North Korea, with ever tighter sanctions and isolation. That is not Mr Moon's way. Is it Donald Trump's?

Who is Moon?

The son of refugees from North Korea, Mr Moon was jailed while a student in the 1970s for leading protests against military ruler Park Chung-hee - Ms Park's father.

Later, he served in South Korea's special forces before becoming a human rights lawyer.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Moon, pictured with his wife, has been there at key points in South Korea's history

He served as a senior aide to liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, who committed suicide in 2009 after leaving office amid bribery allegations.

Mr Moon, of the centre-left Democratic Party, unsuccessfully ran against Ms Park in 2012 elections.

He has positioned himself as the man who can move the country on from the scandals of Ms Park's era.

""I feel that not only my party and myself but also the people have been more desperate for a change of government,"" he said while casting his vote.

What are his policies?

Mr Moon has advocated greater dialogue with the North while maintaining pressure and sanctions, in contrast to Ms Park who cut almost all ties.

He has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.

But while tensions on the Korean peninsula ensured the election was closely watched, for South Koreans the priority has been corruption and the economy, with youth unemployment stubbornly high.

Mr Moon has talked of reforming South Korea's huge family-run conglomerates, known as chaebols, which dominate the domestic economy.",bbc-news
9,Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe react to Draymond Green's shot at the 'weak' Eastern Conference | FOX Sports,"Golden State has barely been tested in the playoffs

“Cleveland in the first round, their first two games, they won by a margin of 3.5 [points per game]. The Portland Trail Blazers and the Golden State Warriors, their first two games Golden State won my a margin of 20. But that was ‘competitive?’

Then he really ramps it up. Toronto and Utah, both 51 wins. Utah, ‘oh they’re fighting through the entire ballgame. We’re just playing great ball. They’re a good team…’

Did he see the final score?

I read a quote where ‘we’re not worried about trying to go 8-0 because Cleveland went 8-0.’ Exactly. Why are you worrying about who they’re playing? You handle your business on your side, in the Western Conference. Let Cleveland do what they do and hopefully we can all get the fight that we want to see - which is the King vs. the Warriors.”",fox-sports
9,'I feel lost. I feel like a child': The complicated decline of Nick Buoniconti | FOX Sports,"A legend, searching for answers When former Dolphins Nick Buoniconti started falling, he knew something was wrong. What he and his family didn’t know was that they’d take a winding path to figuring out what.

This story appears in the May 15, 2017, issue of Sports Illustrated. To subscribe, go here.

They owned the lobby back then. Heads always turned. Men tried not to stare. Kids edged close. The women smiled wider, spoke a bit louder, and maybe their interest was innocent but they sure took the story back home with them, the one about—You won’t believe!—the big name they saw checking into the hotel.

Because in their prime they weren’t like the rest of us. They were larger, better looking—or maybe they just seemed that way because, come September, you saw their faces popping off the TV and in shiny magazines and newspapers. They were pro football players, weekend gods, loud and sure that they owned every room.

That feeling never fully dies. “Teddy!” Nick Buoniconti yells across the lobby of The Inn at Spanish Bay, near Pebble Beach.

It is a November Sunday in 2016, past twilight. The Hall of Fame linebacker, 75 but only slightly bent, is sitting with his wife, Lynn, at a polished table. The fresh faces behind the front desk don’t know Buoniconti; it has been 44 years since he co-captained the Dolphins to three straight Super Bowl seasons, including the league’s only perfect campaign, 17-0 in 1972. He’s not alone: Nearly two dozen greats from the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s are here, wandering through the lobby toward the Grand Ballroom for the 26th annual Legends Invitational dinner. The oldest pass through mostly unnoticed.

But not by everyone. Not by anyone who grew up in the time when we knew little of players besides their names. Starr. Staubach. Tatum. Franco. Say just those words and an entire graying generation will transport back to the primordial highlight show, This Week in Pro Football, all operatic slo-mos and mythic narration.

In the next few hours a roster of venerables—Paul Warfield, Jan Stenerud, Jim Hart—will each utter a small shock at being remembered at all. This will at first seem odd, but it makes sense once they speak of how they missed out on free agency, or spent years fighting the league for better pensions, or are scrambling now to hack through the thicket of the NFL’s $1 billion concussion lawsuit settlement.

“Teddy!” Buoniconti yells again, and over comes Ted Hendricks, 69, along with his longtime partner, Linda Babl. Hendricks, the 6’7” linebacker dubbed “the Mad Stork” and “Kick ’Em in the Head Ted” for his loopy intensity on and off the field, played 15 years in the NFL, partied epically and never missed a game. Nick and Lynn stand.

“How are you doing, Teddy?” Lynn asks.

“Good,” says Ted, grinning. At that, Buoniconti unleashes a deep sigh, one so operatic that at first it seems involuntary; but later, after spending hours with him, one comes to know it as his fallback signal of dismay and, quite often, a looming explosion. Linda’s head pivots.

“How’ve you been?” she says.

Buoniconti doesn’t explain that he can’t figure out how to knot a tie or towel his back. He doesn’t speak of his increasingly useless left hand, the increasingly frequent trips to the emergency room or how, just a few days earlier at his home on Long Island, he hurtled backward down a staircase and sprayed blood all over the hardwood, screaming afterward at Lynn, “I should just kill myself! It doesn’t matter!” He doesn’t mention the three staples subsequently crimped into his scalp, doesn’t explain that just yesterday—in a fit of unexplainable pique, and against his own doctor’s orders—he had another physician come to his hotel room and yank those staples out.

“You know,” Buoniconti says.

And he’s right. Like most everyone who’s close to a former NFL player, Linda is living some variation of the same story. They’ve all seen the big-budget concussion movie and the news clips; they’ve read about the deaths of Junior Seau and Dave Duerson; they’re comparing notes on Facebook about the damage caused by repeated head trauma. They study their men. They accompany them to brain studies and name-drop superstar CTE researchers like Julian Bailes, Bennet Omalu, Robert Cantu, Ann McKee.

“We went to see Dr. Bailes last month, because he’s in Chicago now,” Linda says. “He’s really impressive, as far as one-to-one. Ted’s been in his study in North Carolina, the neuro-feedback . . . .”

Buoniconti releases another sigh.

It’s so random. Hendricks has only minor memory lapses. Some of Buoniconti’s Dolphins teammates, meanwhile, are crumbling. Quarterback Earl Morrall, the supersub so key to the Perfect Season, died at 79, in 2014, with Stage 4 CTE. Running back Jim Kiick, 70, lived in squalor until he was placed in an assisted living facility last summer with dementia/early onset Alzheimer’s. Bill Stanfill, a defensive end who long suffered from dementia, died in November at 69. His brain and spine were sent to the CTE center at Boston University, where the disease has been found in 96% of players’ brains studied. (Granted, that’s 96% of a group whose medical or playing history already suggests some sort of brain disease.)

“Everybody’s searching,” Buoniconti says in an aside, dropping his voice. “Some go to North Carolina, some to BU, some to UCLA. And it’s all related. That’s why it’s so unnecessary, what the NFL is putting the players through by making us document the neurological deficiencies. Not everybody can afford to go through that. And they say they’ll pay for it—but do you know what that’s like, actually getting the money?”

Ted and Linda leave for the ballroom. Nick and Lynn sit. Hall of Fame Vikings defensive end Chris Doleman stops by. He talks about how even the most familiar routines have become confounding, how he wakes up in his own bed wondering, Am I in a hotel? “And I’m 55,” he says. “I don’t know what I’ll be like at 59 or 65.”

“At 55 I was very normal,” Buoniconti says. “I’m not normal anymore.”

This is hard, at times, to believe. Everyone tells Nick he looks “great.” Indeed, he’ll soon get up before a packed ballroom and emcee the night’s program, tick off the names of every co-host, sponsor and speaker, tell war stories. He’ll even fire off a snappy rejoinder to a heckler in the crowd.

But few saw Buoniconti teeter as he walked off the stage, perhaps because of the atrophy to his right frontal cortex seen in 2015. Fewer noticed Nick motioning for Lynn as he bolted from the ballroom, perhaps because of the neurodegenerative dementia diagnosis just a month ago—or the yet-unspoken opinion that his condition could actually be corticobasal syndrome, complicated by an atypical Parkinsonian Syndrome or CTE or Alzheimer’s. He had to pee. And Lynn had to stand by to unbutton and unzip him and ensure that he’d emerge from the men’s room dry and unexposed.

And no one here saw him before all that, when Buoniconti stood up in the hotel lobby and headed toward the ballroom. “I feel lost,” he said. “I feel like a child.”

It’s forever easy to think that Miami’s top industry, after tourism, boils down to the cliché of political chicanery, petty vanities and believe-it-or-not news stories (“Florida Man Arrested with Alligator in His Backpack”) that continue to make Carl Hiaasen and Dave Barry very rich. Few fly into MIA expecting gravitas. Yet, of course, serious work goes on here. After a helmet-first tackle in 1985 made a quadriplegic of Buoniconti’s son Marc, a linebacker at The Citadel, Nick teamed up with University of Miami neurosurgeon Barth Green to co-found the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, leveraging every angle of Buoniconti’s celebrity to raise $2 million in year one. By 1990 the Project was well on its way to becoming the world’s largest center for spinal cord-injury and paralysis research, one of South Florida’s few civic anchors.

Much of that was due to Nick’s irresistible backstory. The Dolphins’ 1972 and ’73 championships command unique reverence as the fractured region’s first pro sports title winners. And Marc’s paralysis, widely covered in the media, lent Nick’s fame horrific depth; he became an unwilling model for life after the cheering stops and was accorded universal respect, even awe, for enduring what seemed an unending penance.

For though Marc became the Miami Project’s face, it was Nick who provided the indefatigable fuel for a money engine—the Buoniconti Fund—that has now raised more than $450 million, pays the salaries of 300 scientists and staff, and provides hope and comfort to thousands. Year after year, it was always Nick recruiting doctors, cajoling athletes to attend the Project’s annual New York City gala, making call after call on a mission that, on a personal level at least, seemed doomed.

“I would trade this [Super Bowl] ring in, and all my individual accomplishments, if one thing could happen in my lifetime,” Nick said to conclude his Pro Football Hall of Fame induction speech, in 2001. “My son Marc dreams that he walks. And as a father, I would like nothing more than to walk by his side.”

The ironic tragedy—that the very game which made Nick’s name also destroyed his son—became South Florida lore: How his first wife, Terry (Marc’s mother), pleaded with Marc’s older brother, Nick III, to cut short his career at Duke rather than risk facing another devastating blow. How, consumed by guilt, Nick once threatened to wrench off his Perfect Season ring and never wear it again. When Terry divorced Nick in 1997 after 35 years together, the news went notably uncovered; no one, it seemed, had the stomach for what seemed the last casualty of Marc’s collision, even if Nick didn’t publicly indulge any narrative connecting the events or guilt. “I never blamed myself,” Buoniconti told me when we first met in 2009, ring still on his hand. “I never blamed football.”

No, Nick saw Marc’s fate as a lightning-bolt rarity, a freak event compounded by The Citadel’s allegedly negligent medical staff. (A jury dismissed the Buoniconti’s $22.5 million lawsuit against a team doctor in 1988; the school and trainer settled with the family for $800,000.) Conceding the irony of his family’s relationship with the game is one thing—“Our greatest joy and greatest sadness, right”—but condemning football as inherently destructive was always something else. Wasn’t he himself proof otherwise?

Few longtime players—much less linebackers—emerged from the NFL fray more spectacularly intact. After retirement in 1976 Buoniconti went on to hit a pinnacle in three more careers: attorney and agent for 30 pro athletes; millionaire president of U.S. Tobacco; co-host for 23 years on HBO’s Inside the NFL. In 2009, when I met him to write a Sports Illustrated piece on Marc, Nick was humming along with No. 4, the Miami Project. He was 68, looked 15 years younger, played golf daily; he and Lynn lived in a $1.98 million home in Coral Gables. He sat on the terrace of his nearby country club, dynamic and bluntly eloquent. People kept stopping to say hello.

The family liked the story, but I didn’t speak to Nick again. Then, last October, he left a phone message. Nick, his words slightly halting, asked me to call him back and recited his number. “Okay,” he said. “Goodbye.”

Then came a long pause. You could hear him turn away from the phone. Finally Buoniconti asked, “How do you hang up, Lynn?”

Her voice, quavering, rose in disbelief. “ ‘How do you hang up?’ ” Lynn called from the background.

“Yeah.”

Then the line went dead.

Was there ever a more American life? Was there ever more reason for a man to be happy? Nick Buoniconti, born in 1940 the grandson of Italian immigrants, was raised in the south end of Springfield, Mass., by loving parents, surrounded by countless relatives, enveloped in the scent of fresh-baked bread. He came of age in a U.S. rising to world dominance and lived out its favorite narrative: Forever underestimated, time and again he proved all doubters wrong.

But Buoniconti wasn’t light of heart. Even at his warmest he possessed a hard, judgmental eye, wary of depending on anyone. Maybe that came from being a baker’s boy, ambitious in a home with no money for college. Or maybe it went deeper; his mother, Patsy, was a Mercolino, the Neapolitan family line streaked with a dark certitude: Life is out to get you. And wasn’t it? Nick nearly drowned at two, fell out of a moving car at three and survived scarlet fever at eight. At 12, when the school year ended, he went into the tobacco fields, weeding, picking, suckering and stringing leaves in draining heat for $6 a day.

Sure, for a six-year altar boy, the pride of the nuns at Cathedral High, Buoniconti’s ascension to play football at Notre Dame in 1958 seemed the apex of Catholic dreams. But disillusion came fast. An all-state outfielder, Nick loved baseball like his dad, Big Nick, who’d pitched semi-pro ball all over New England. Notre Dame, beacon of virtue, lured young Nick with the promise that—Sure, son—he could play baseball, too. But upon arrival, Buoniconti found that he was there for football, period. “Notre Dame lied to me,” he says.

No wonder that, compared to headhunting peers like Dick Butkus, Buoniconti always came off as strictly business. When Dolphins coach Don Shula learned, decades later, of Buoniconti’s childhood nickname, he nearly choked. “You mean to tell me,” he said, “that I coached a mean son of a bitch named Skippy?!’”

Tough, mulish—any variant will do. Buoniconti was the only player to survive telling Shula, in front of the team, to “shut the f--- up.” Shula bristled, but he respected it: Buoniconti was rushing to a teammate’s defense. He didn’t do anything for effect. He couldn’t afford to. This was an All-America who, after Notre Dame coach Joe Kuharich dubbed him too small to play pro ball—“He’ll run through a brick wall for you,” Kuharich quipped, “but he’ll leave a small hole”—had been humiliatingly ignored by the NFL and passed over in the first 12 rounds of the upstart AFL’s draft.

Buoniconti, at 215 pounds, played guard and linebacker during one of Notre Dame’s worst eras and seemed a Fighting Irish epitome—pious, macho, consumed by football. But he wasn’t. Irked freshman year by his boring quarterback roommate, Buoniconti kicked him out and moved in with newfound pal Richie Catenacci, a 5'4"" civilian. Told by the Dean of Men, a priest, that he was breaking Notre Dame’s long tradition of housing athletes together, Nick dug in. “The rule is stupid,” he said.

The two young men roomed together for four years, had the usual alcohol-fueled escapades, became best friends. Buoniconti convinced his roommate there was nothing unmanly about singing in the glee club, and it changed Catenacci’s life. Richie insisted that Nick improve a weak vocabulary, so they created a “word of the day” to learn and use. “He wanted to be educated, well-spoken,” Catenacci says.

Yet Buoniconti also played each snap with life-or-death fervor. He led the Irish with 74 tackles his senior year and then, minutes into his first day of Boston Patriots camp, in 1962, brawled with veteran tight end—and ordained Baptist minister—Tony Romeo, who Nick says infringed on “my territory, my land.” It wasn’t a matter of manhood. Buoniconti held no romantic notions about the game. Football was a vehicle, a means, and championships made it move faster. That year he married his high school sweetheart, Terry Salamano, a nurse. He wanted to be rich.

“He worked so hard,” Terry says, “but I always felt it was to better our lives, our children’s lives. The naiveté: We went to somebody’s house and they had all this shrimp in a bowl and we were like, ‘Look at all that shrimp!’ We didn’t even know what caviar was. It was beautiful. I felt that we grew together.”

Opponents, meanwhile, sniffed at Buoniconti’s size, compared him to a fire hydrant, even if he did lead the Patriots in tackles and interceptions over his seven seasons. Nick didn’t care. “When Butkus hits you, you fall the way he wants,” he said. “When I hit you, you fall the way you want. But you still fall.”

Such satisfactions went only so far. The $15,000 he earned as a rookie was never going to be enough. In 1963, Terry had Gina, the first of three quick babies, and Nick enrolled at Boston’s Suffolk Law School, racing to courses at night, briefing cases on road trips, studying while teammates partied. He finished in four years. “I didn’t particularly care for football,” he says. “I was tired of it.”

Buoniconti didn’t know it then, but such is the secret of all good negotiators: He could walk away. He had just signed a lease to open a law office in Chestnut Hill when the Patriots traded him to the hapless Dolphins before the 1969 season. Miami owner Joe Robbie was a famous skinflint; Nick, acting as his own agent, demanded double his pay, guaranteed. “We don’t give guaranteed contracts,” Robbie said.

Buoniconti sent his retirement papers to the NFL. Robbie tried holding firm, but—even with the law practice stalled and his only alternative a $10,000 job at the U.S. attorney’s office—Nick wouldn’t budge. “It really didn’t matter to me if I retired,” Buoniconti says. “I didn’t care.”

Robbie folded. Buoniconti was named the Dolphins’ MVP his first season and, after Shula took over, again when they improved from three to 10 wins in 1970. In ’71, with Buoniconti the hub of coordinator Bill Arnsparger’s ever-stunting defenses, the Dolphins surrendered just 12.4 points a game and blanked the defending champ Colts in the AFC championship. By then the assault on Buoniconti’s body and brain was well underway. He says he was knocked unconscious four or five times over his 14-year career, the worst during the Cowboys’ 24–3 rout of Miami in Super Bowl VI that January. Buoniconti smashed into a player in the third quarter and blacked out—but stayed on his feet and on the field until game’s end. “I was gone,” he says. “That was the worst one. I don’t remember playing.”

The subsequent Perfect Season in ’72—the undefeated, untied campaign culminating in a 14–7 win over Washington in Super Bowl VI—remains the team’s monument, but in ’73, on the way to another Super Bowl title, the Dolphins allowed even fewer points, just five touchdown passes all season, and Buoniconti set a team record with 162 tackles.

Buoniconti has estimated that he absorbed 520,000 hits to the head. “My last game, I got on my hands and knees and kissed the ground and thanked God that I’d never gotten seriously hurt.”

Of those, 91 came unassisted, and over time it would become clear which flank he favored. Buoniconti’s right wrist, knee and ankle would become arthritic; his right hip would need to be replaced; range of motion in his right shoulder was limited. Buoniconti has publicly estimated that over his 14-year pro career (not to mention 13 more years in boyhood, high school and college football) he has absorbed some 520,000 hits to the head. That MRIs in 2015 and ’16 would reveal brain shrinkage—surfacing first in the right frontal and temporal regions—seemed almost logical.

At the time Buoniconti noticed none of it. A broken right thumb forced him to miss the 1975 season, and he gladly began working as a CBS analyst. A spate of injuries prompted the Dolphins to ask him back in ’76, twice; Buoniconti demanded $125,000 and got it. He started just four games that season, then said goodbye for good. He was 36, certain he’d gotten out clean.

“My last game, at the end I got on my hands and knees and kissed the ground and thanked God that I’d never gotten seriously hurt,” Buoniconti says. “Fourteen-year career? I could’ve been maimed.”

Instead, he looked great. Wavy hair just starting to gray, hawkish nose: From the neck up Nick looked like Michelangelo’s David, done slinging rocks and ready to be anointed king. He radiated authority, though that on-field ferocity needed softening, first in the courtroom, and later as the agent for Yankees shortstop Bucky Dent, Expos outfielder Andre Dawson and others.

Loaded with leverage after Dent’s epic playoff home run over the Red Sox in 1978, Buoniconti nearly laughed when New York owner George Steinbrenner threatened to trade Dent the following winter. “Go ahead!” Buoniconti told him over lunch. “There’ll be a lot of takers.”

Steinbrenner stonewalled through the 1979 season, and Dent walked out of Yankee Stadium after the final game certain his time in the Bronx was over. Buoniconti, unfazed, mused to reporters about the team’s hardships, told the Yankees’ GM that Dent was signing with the Angels and booked their flight to L.A. Steinbrenner signed Dent to a five-year extension. “Good luck with your prenup, honey,” Steinbrenner later told Lynn, when Nick introduced her as his fiancée at a New York benefit. “That’s the meanest guy I ever negotiated with.”

Because he could walk away—from just about anyone. Buoniconti loved corporate work, pushing paper, because, he says, “I didn’t have to deal with clients.” In 1980 he landed Dawson’s first $1 million-a-year salary; four years later, after Dawson hadn’t heard from Buoniconti for 14 months, Dawson fired him. “When I got traded, I didn’t hear from him, either,” Dent says of his midseason departure from the Yankees in ’82. “I was like, What’s going on here? Nick wasn’t one of those warm-and-fuzzy guys . . . but he did a good job for me.”

To be fair, Buoniconti’s plate was piled high. People kept tapping him for leadership, for connections to his old buddies from his days in Boston and the AFL, guys like congressmen Jack Kemp and Tip O’Neill. In 1982 the Dade County Democratic party named Nick chairman; he quickly organized a $250-a-plate dinner, induced the governor to come, and raised $80,000. Meanwhile, his long association with U.S. Tobacco, the nation’s largest purveyor of smokeless products, like Skoal and Copenhagen, was beginning to pay off.

UST’s president, Louis Bantle, first asked Buoniconti and some other Dolphins to mingle at a client cocktail party in the early 1970s. Then he hired Nick for legal work. In ’83 Nick was named executive VP in charge of legal and federal affairs and public relations. Sales had spiked fivefold over the previous decade, but clouds loomed; the business was becoming viewed as a health menace. In ’88, the U.S. surgeon general declared nicotine goods such as chewing tobacco to be as addictive as heroin.

But even as Buoniconti lobbied over the years for the tobacco industry, his image as an athlete—and a perfect one, at that—prevailed. Indeed, he proved so valuable a spokesman that in ’85, Bantle made him UST’s president and COO. The one-time tobacco picker—who had never smoked or dipped himself—became the industry’s most famous, and ardent, defender.

In one typical interview that fall, with the Chicago Tribune, Buoniconti railed against “anti-tobacco forces” and touted scientists who, he said, maintained “there’s absolutely nothing wrong with your product.” He went on: “We’ll survive. We were the first packaged-good product in the United States. We helped fund the Revolutionary War!”

It wasn’t the last time Buoniconti’s mind, shrewd and curious, would dodge a discomfiting truth. He’s not incapable of irony—“I thought 1985 would be a great year because 85 was my jersey number and so great to me, and actually it was the worst year of my life”—but Buoniconti sprang out of an era when guilt didn’t travel over generations. He liked to believe that the world came at a man head on, laid out choices and left him free to choose. Use tobacco or don’t. Play football or don’t.

It’s not in Buoniconti to admit the sheer weirdness of the fact that in ’85 he became a human fulcrum—at once seller and sufferer, perpetrator and victim—of public health crises involving two titanic American pastimes. “I’m not getting into that, O.K.?” he yells. “One has nothing to do with the other!”

A day after Marc’s injury, Terry found her husband sitting on the floor outside intensive care, tears streaming, saying, “God is punishing me, God is punishing me.”

The first blow came in the summer when Big Nick, a lifetime smoker, died at 75 of lung cancer, just as his son was taking over UST. Of his four-year stint on top of the company, Buoniconti says, “I loved it. I loved being in charge; it was like being a middle linebacker and calling the defenses.” Asked if he ever felt conflicted, considering tobacco’s now-confirmed harmful effects, he says, “Yeah, we were under fire a lot, mostly taxes. But in my mind, we never marketed it to kids. It was a good job. I enjoyed it.”

The second blow came 12 days after he invoked the American Revolution in the Tribune. Nick and Terry were at the New Jersey spread of his old roomie, Richie Catenacci. It was a perfect Saturday, the kind where you can’t help but think, Yes, we made it: 72 degrees, sitting in the gazebo, sipping champagne. Nick asked Catenacci’s nephew to check the football scores; both games featuring his linebacker sons—Marc at The Citadel, Nick III at Duke—had been going for an hour. The phone rang.

It was Bantle. Marc had been hurt; no one knew how bad. Bantle gave Nick a number to call. He dialed thinking, Shoulder, maybe a knee. . . . A doctor answered. His first words were, “Mr. Buoniconti, your son dislocated his neck and he’s going to be paralyzed for the rest of his life.”

Nick fell to his knees. Richie reached down to grab him but, for the first time in their 27-year friendship, Nick looked lost. “How am I going to tell his mother?” he begged. But he did it; he went outside and blasted a hole in Terry’s world. She’ll never forget that day, how beautiful it was, Nick’s face coming closer, his mouth saying that Marc would never walk again. She’ll never forget, too, how a day later, outside of intensive care, she found her husband sitting on the floor, tears streaming, saying, “God is punishing me, God is punishing me.”

And right then, amid a mother’s worst nightmare and a scuttling fear, Terry had this one moment of clarity. She leaned over to her husband. “God doesn’t work that way,” she said.

Before she became Nick’s wife, in 2000, Lynn could well imagine the black-hole enormity that paralysis becomes to anyone within its orbit. But it still took years of fundraisers and medical crises for her to realize this: “I say that Nick is married to Marc, because the No. 1 priority in Nick Buoniconti’s life is Marc Buoniconti,” Lynn says.

But she didn’t understand that fully until 2008, when Justin, her then-21-year-old son by her first marriage, was assaulted outside a Cambridge, Mass., bar and nearly died of a traumatic brain injury. “I know now: It’s as if Nick carries Marc’s weight on his shoulders,” Lynn says. “You move heaven and earth to help your child, especially when they go through a life-or-death experience.”

Once Marc was stabilized and placed into Barth Green’s care in October 1985, Nick moved fast. He landed a $100,000 pledge from UST immediately and within a month organized a fundraiser at a Dolphins game that raised another $300,000. The Miami Project was underway. “Nick is extraordinary,” Green says. “I’ve taken care of thousands of patients with brain and spinal cord injuries and paralysis, but I’ve never had a person stay so committed so long. Everybody’s gung-ho for a year or two, then they disappear. Nick has raised several hundred million dollars, and I attribute almost all of it to his charisma, his national presence, his intelligence and ability to articulate the importance of curing paralysis.”

Some believe the accident changed Nick. How could it not? Before, he was ensconced at UST headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., hardly a presence as Marc smoked pot, vandalized cars and homes, and bombed grades at South Miami’s Columbus High. Before, he’d see someone in a wheelchair, think Too bad, and keep walking. Marc’s paralysis humbled Nick, grounded him in a way that fame and fortune never could. His focus shifted south, to Miami and Marc and the Project and home.

“To the degree that he got fired from UST,” Green says. “The CEO said, ‘Look, we need a full-time president. You’ve got to give this your all. Otherwise . . . .’ And that’s when Nick left.”

The fact that UST health insurance, as part of his separation agreement, would continue to cover most of Marc’s estimated $500,000 in annual expenses made the move easier. And hustling for the Miami Project filled the void of attention and purpose felt by many retired athletes. But Nick also found himself more tolerant. A squeamish Nick held Marc during each of Marc’s ensuing health scares. In 2014, when a near-fatal respiratory infection had his son saying, for the first time, “Just let it end,” Nick spent eight hours a day, for six weeks, by Marc’s side.

“Every day in the hospital—and he hates a hospital—he sat there with me,” Marc says. Then, after a deep breath, his eyes widen and he adds, “And with my mom!”

Such emphasis assumes a knowledge of how tough that might be. After all, his parents’ spiky relationship was hardly a secret in Miami after their bitter split in 1997—and basic chronology made it easy to figure. In the fall of ’95 the 54-year-old Nick met Lynn Weiss at Dakota, a bar on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Monday Night Football was on the TV, she was 12 years his junior and vivacious, the owner of a successful travel business. “The smartest person I’ve ever met,” Nick says. He was entranced; Lynn wasn’t. But soon they were an item.

Nick and Terry, together since Cathedral High, were still married. She was furious when she found out about Lynn. At least once Buoniconti wondered, to Catenacci, why they couldn’t carry on: Growing up, a mistress—a goumad—wasn’t unheard of in some Italian households.

“There’s a side of Nick that wants to have it all and a side that recognizes you can’t,” says Catenacci. “I said, ‘The world has changed and you can’t have a wife and a goumad anymore. That’s original sin, and you know Terry’s not going to put up with that. You know the right thing—do it.’ And he did.”

That may sound like the morality of a man cornered, but Buoniconti resists glib pigeonholing. A former Democratic leader once horrified by cannabis, he supports Donald Trump and now entertains the idea of using medical marijuana. Appalled by the racist welcome doled out to black players upon their arrival for the 1965 AFL All-Star Game in New Orleans, Buoniconti joined—and fully backed—a boycott that forced the game’s move to Houston.

After decades of dating women, in the early 1990s Catenacci fell in love with a man, but he didn’t tell Nick. Years passed. Finally, on an Aspen ski lift, Buoniconti confronted his old roommate. “So when are you going to tell me?”

“What do you want to know?” Catenacci asked.

“Does he love you? Because you know I love you, and I would never want anybody to hurt you.”

Lynn’s first real scare came with Nick behind the wheel. This was in 2013. During a drive in Fort Lauderdale, all the stimuli absorbed without thinking—lights, pedestrians, directions, chitchat, radio—came confusingly alive for Nick. A simple turn across oncoming traffic became a mess, and his car jumped a curb. But he was also 72, had been forgetting things: a phone number here, a social commitment there. Lynn chalked it up to age. Then he started falling. Yet even to his doctors, it was hard to see anything out of the ordinary.

His falling had become commonplace—taking out the garbage, walking the dog. With each spill, Nick got angrier, resenting his body—the instrument that gave him everything—for betraying him.

Because unlike Mike Webster or Duerson or Seau, who suffered dramatic depression in their 30s and 40s and were dead at 50, Buoniconti’s brain trouble only surfaced in his early 70s, when even non-football playing brains present signs of shrinkage and decay. And even then, he was still speaking and flying and golfing; a February 2014 MRI at the University of Miami attributed the “mild asymmetric volume loss” in Nick’s right anterior temporal lobe—and his balance and memory issues—as “compatible with age-appropriate involutional changes.”

But then food became an obsession. Dinner out with friends would start off well—wine flowing, fun couple—then they’d notice Nick hadn’t spoken for a bit. Ordering took on urgency. He spent long minutes staring down at his plate. Lynn tried alerting his children, Gina and Nick III and Marc, but they didn’t see Nick daily. And besides, he’d always been a handful. That’s just Dad: Intense, likes to be waited on . . . .

His handwriting slowed, and became spidery. On a freezing day he came home distressed from the gym; he couldn’t figure out how to put on his coat. By then his falling had become commonplace—taking out the garbage, walking the dog, standing up from a chair. He’d drop like a sack of cement, face-first, and bleed plenty but feel no pain; by the end of 2014 he was averaging nearly one serious spill a month. And with each fall he got angrier, resenting his body—the instrument that gave him everything—for betraying him.

Doctors at the University of Miami seemed less alarmed, recommending close observation. A December 2014 exam noted that Buoniconti “does seem to be altered in his mental status,” but attributed that to, among other things, a recent fever. Lynn felt otherwise. In January ’15 she arranged a summit meeting at the Miami Project offices attended by Barth Green; scientific director Dalton Dietrich; Nick’s personal physician, Eugene Sayfie; Lynn; Nick and Gina. Marc attended via conference call.

* * *

Lynn, Nick and Gina recall that the medical staff in the meeting seemed settled on the idea that Buoniconti’s balance and mental issues were typical markers of aging, probably compounded by his football history. Green insists that he and the rest of the UM doctors were hardly that casual, that they told the family “that Nick had a post-traumatic syndrome,” Green says, “that some of the things that were happening to him were definitely related to his multiple head injuries, but he also had other stuff going on and it wasn’t classical for anything—for Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s.”

At one point Marc, by phone, speculated that, by harping on Nick’s difficulties, Lynn was creating a “self-fulfilling prophecy”—and only making matters worse. “I still don’t know what that means. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” Nick says. “If I didn’t have this issue, I wouldn’t be talking about it.”

Finally, Gina cut in. “No: You have to listen to Lynn,” she said. “She lives with him.”

A subsequent round of neuropsychological tests found that, though Buoniconti did not “meet criteria for dementia or mild cognitive impairment,” he had mild decrements; another brain MRI that same month, however, again revealed only “age-appropriate involutional changes.” But if the medical picture was foggy, other proof seemed clear. On April 13, 2015, an ambulance rushed Buoniconti to the ER after he gashed his nose and eye in another fall. A month later, Lynn filmed Nick’s tortuous, nearly two-minute process of figuring out how to put on a T-shirt and ball cap. And both were losing patience with Buoniconti’s longtime colleagues at the Miami Project.

“I felt let down, that they didn’t understand what I’m going through—or they didn’t seem interested in finding out what I’m going through,” Buoniconti says.

In fact, Green says, the UM team had long been concerned by Buoniconti’s “cascade of sequelae”—physical and mental symptoms—and suspected CTE and its precipitating brain-clogging protein, tau, as one possible cause. But “I think all of us were in denial,” Green says. “And then once we saw what was going on, we faced a dilemma : As Nick’s friends and family here at the Miami Project, are we going to tell him, ‘Nick, you’re going downhill, and you’ve got a disease’—when there’s really no treatment or any of the symptoms? Or should we say, ‘Nick, you look great and you’re doing well and I wouldn’t worry about this’?

The video Nick Buoniconti's family wants you to see For 14 years, Nick Buoniconti decimated offenses. Then, the erosion set in.

“So we decided, as a group, that we weren’t going to shove it down his throat unless we have something that could stop this cascade of neurological events and reverse it. As his symptoms grew, we tried to reinforce the positive—the fact he still was a kick-ass guy, he could get in front of these people and empty their pockets of millions of dollars to help research, and he could play in a golf tournament.

“Lynn was never ignored,” Green continues. “She loves Nick a lot, but in her zealousness to get help for him she’s constantly—publicly and in private—telling him that he’s going to hell. So: different philosophy. We didn’t think that was the way to go. And I still don’t think so. I don’t think it does any damn good to tell him, ‘Your whole brain is going to be full of tau. You’re dying and people aren’t caring about you, and you’re just going to keep getting worse and you need to be taken care of.’ What did that accomplish then, and what does it accomplish now? That’s not the way I fly, and it’s not because I’m stupid. It’s not because I don’t love him. It’s just a different strategy.”

At the same time, Green did recommend the testing regimen that led University of Miami doctors to a more specific diagnosis. In the spring of 2015, the head of UM’s Neuropsychology Department, Bonnie Levin, became the first to cite CTE as a possible cause of Buoniconti’s mental decline. Another UM neurologist, Carlos Singer, declared in a May ’15 summary that Buoniconti’s physical and mental symptoms were most compatible with senile dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, CTE and frontotemporal dementia.

A definitive CTE diagnosis is possible only by autopsy. But experimental testing (involving PET scans after the injection of radioactive dye that highlights the protein tau, which can be an indicator of the disease) has increasingly showed evidence of CTE in small samples of living patients. In November 2013, Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett—the most famous of a cadre of 14 NFL veterans who underwent that testing—revealed to ESPN that his exam at UCLA confirmed the presence of tau and other signs of CTE. A year and a half later, in May 2015, at Lynn’s suggestion, Singer agreed to refer Buoniconti for an experimental PET scan at the Feinstein Institute in Manhasset, N.Y., on Long Island.

But Nick was tired of the prodding. They flew to their Long Island home, and summer and fall passed there with him refusing to go. Lynn issued a winter ultimatum: Do the scans or I’m not going back to Miami. Now he knew how Robbie and Steinbrenner felt.

Though they did not measure specifically for tau, the two Feinstein scans indicated damage that went beyond “involutional”—consistent with Parkinsonian syndrome and CTE. The Feinstein neurologist, Andrew Feigin, confirmed to Nick that atrophy had set in on the right side of his brain and believed it was due to abnormal amounts of tau. He said the protein would soon spread to the left side, and that it could never be reversed.

“It was like a car accident,” Lynn says. “The point of impact.”

The couple stopped at a diner on the way home. Nick said “yeah” when she asked if he understood, and then they sat there crying.

* * *

It felt like a death sentence. There was no word, no possible treatment, offering any hope. And Buoniconti wasn’t a glass-half-full guy to begin with. Even when his life had seemed a testament to optimism, his disposition had folks calling him Negative Nick. Now, with neither work nor golf to distract him, Buoniconti’s lifelong terror of dying had room to run. The Mercolino darkness kicked in hard.

“We’re the players who built the game, but have been forgotten,” Nick says. “The settlement is a joke. They are waiting for us to die.”

“He’s frustrated and depressed,” Marc said in November. “He’s lost in his own physical disability and there’s no break from it. He’s sitting at his house; he has no outlets. He falls down, and that conversation only exacerbates it. That’s his life, man-—a vicious cycle.”

Marc calls it “heartbreaking” to watch his rock crumble, but he didn’t doubt the reason. For decades he had pushed back against those who cited his paralysis as Exhibit A in the case against the game, celebrating it as a vehicle for character building and teamwork. No more.

“If someone asked if their child should play organized contact football, I could not in good conscience recommend it,” Marc says. “I don’t think it’s safe. It’s pretty evident that something significant is happening to the brain as far as disrupted development over time. I cannot recommend football for, really, anybody. I was 50-50 on this already but, then, watching my dad—that sealed it for me.”

Though he knows this admission cements the Buonicontis as the first family of football tragedy, Marc won’t play the victim. Early predictions had him living 20 years, tops, as a quadriplegic, and he’s survived at least four near-death scares in the 31 years since. He calls his existence “gravy.” And in his 32nd year inside a lifeless body, something has changed; for the first time, father and son’s roles have reversed. Now Marc’s the one urging Nick to stop with the self-pity. There’s always someone worse off than you..

Says Marc: “I’ve told him, ‘You’ve got to get your s--- together. Look at me. My life sucks, but I make the best of it.’ And he’s like, ‘I know, I know.’ But it hasn’t changed his approach to life.”

Though he knows Lynn’s lot is thankless—“God bless her for taking care of him; my dad’s a pain in the ass”—Marc still wonders if her focus on Nick’s deficits makes them worse. Nick and Lynn scoff at this; it remains a touchy issue. But drained of family drama, Marc’s theory on positive reinforcement seems less a potshot than one more desperate response to an epidemic without cure. Everybody’s searching.

And the fact is, one reason Nick decided to make public his decline was to mine some good of it. No ailing ex-player, after all, has had more resources—a blue-ribbon health care plan, money for the travel and costs of experimental tests that insurance won’t cover, instant access to an innovative and grateful medical staff, a partner with patience enough to research studies and sift medical files and schedule appointments—with which to navigate his condition. Yet even he is a confused mess.

“So if I’m having this problem and Lynn is hovering over me making sure things get done, can you imagine someone in the same situation who can’t figure it out?” Nick asks. “I feel for these guys. They have no direction. It’s not fair that you make the league all this money, and they don’t care about you anymore. You think they care about a player who no longer can contribute to their financial success? Come on.”

The NFL, the Players Association and the Hall of Fame Players Foundation do have various outreach programs for former players; NFL Player Care, set up in 2007, has provided more than $12 million to 980 former players in financial need and contributed $6.6 million to medical research studies. (In late April Nick hired three medical aides for round-the-clock assistance, tapping into the NFL and NFLPA’s jointly-run 88 Plan, which provides up to $118,000 per year for in-home care.) In 2010 the NFL added a neurological care program to evaluate and treat “possible” conditions for vested retirees. But the outreach for all of the above has hardly been ideal, and the $1 billion concussion settlement has added a huge new layer of bureaucracy—and resentment.

Few of the estimated 20,000 players covered by the settlement would seem better equipped to understand its legal issues and jargon than Buoniconti. The older the former player, the less likely that diseases like Alzheimer’s, ALS or dementia can be attributed solely to football; CTE remains undiagnosable in the living. That means that virtually all those who played before 1993, when NFL free agency took effect, will again miss out on the big money. For example: Nick’s dementia diagnosis, combined with his age and 14-year career, make him eligible for a settlement of just $132,000.

He doesn’t need that money to finance his evaluations and travel costs and treatments, but others of his era do. “The NFL should be volunteering to pay for this,” Buoniconti screamed abruptly in a UCLA examination room last November. “I’m so f------ pissed off at them!

“We’re the players who built the game, but have been forgotten. The settlement is a joke; the way it was structured is a joke. They are waiting for us to die. They’re going to play the clock out until everybody dies.”

So Buoniconti has one last fight on his hands. It’s not simple, like his rookie scuffle with the Reverend Romeo. It’s not clear, like his mission to cure paralysis. No, this battle lies within, between warring impulses. There are days he wants to know exactly what’s wrong with his brain, if only because naming an enemy gives you a better chance of defeating it. And there are days when he doesn’t. What difference will it make? He’s not looking to end football. The game was his steel mill, his coal mine—a way up and out.

“I didn’t have any idea the price would be this debilitating,” Buoniconti says. “Had I known, would I have played? I had no alternative; there was no other way for me to get a college education. Football kept rewarding me—I can’t deny that. But I’m paying the price.” He shrugs, grins. “Everybody pays the piper.”

He’s hardly so resigned day to day. Buoniconti’s temper ignites over the smallest frustrations—a ringing phone, bed blankets, a hand proffered to help him stand. In January 2016 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and Lynn with breast cancer, and the treatment has been draining. Just before the family gathered for the annual Miami Project gala in New York City last September, Nick tumbled over a chair and gashed up his forehead and nose again.

“When you marry your best friend and now he’s not your best friend anymore because there’s someone else in there, it’s very difficult,” Lynn says. “He looks like the person I married. But he really isn’t there.”

In September 2016, Gina, Marc and Nick III urged their dad to hire a driver and live-in aide, and stick to his prescribed therapies, if for nothing else than to save his marriage. “She was ready to leave him,” Marc says. “I don’t blame her.”

“Had I known, would I have played?” Buoniconti says. “I had no alternative. Football kept rewarding me—I can’t deny that.”

The night Buoniconti was to emcee the gala in New York, an HBO makeup artist slathered pancake on the fresh gashes on his face. A New York Times videographer tried interviewing him, but his mind derailed 46 seconds in. “I’m not ready for this,” Nick said, wandering abruptly off camera. It took 20 minutes of sitting alone in the Waldorf ballroom before Lynn could calm him down. (Terry, who is remarried and goes months without seeing Nick, was there and struck by his vacant stare. “I thought, ‘Is he going to be able to even get through speaking?’” she says. “But he got up there and did great.”)

Still, it was to placate Lynn, as much as anything, that Buoniconti agreed to ride from Pebble Beach to Westwood last November for a preliminary workup at UCLA’s groundbreaking BrainSPORT Program. But that set off another roller coaster. First, a lift: Initial exams there seemed to rule out Alzheimer’s disease and CTE. Then, six weeks later, a drop: Buoniconti’s UCLA MRI revealed significant atrophy in his frontal lobes, and the resulting diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome was what Green had been wrestling with all along. Not only is CBS a catchall that could indicate Alzheimer’s and CTE, but it’s often paired with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), a disease with a sharply defined prognosis. With no treatment or cure, “we didn’t want to pin that diagnosis on Nick because he could Google it,” Green says, “and see that the average life expectancy is six or seven years.”

The UCLA team thus recommended a cerebrospinal tap and an experimental PET scan to test for Alzheimer’s-type amyloid and the tau prominent in CTE. Nick wanted nothing to do with either. For months Lynn pushed, and he dug in. She wanted confirmation of what they were facing; he wanted only reversal.

Then, in early February, the thinnest straw presented itself: One of Nick’s brothers emailed about a newspaper story in which Joe Namath controversially claimed marked brain improvement following 120 sessions of breathing pure oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber. Despite being claustrophobic, Nick lunged for it.

He called Namath, who described a complete cure. He called Green, who was skeptical. Four University of Miami doctors weighed in, calling the procedure—which is highly effective for wound care—“relatively safe” but utterly unproven to render long-term brain improvement. Nick didn’t care. He stopped physical therapy and insisted instead on going to UM Hospital for a 140-minute, five-day-a-week experimental course of inhaling pure oxygen at high pressure in what looks like a giant transparent tanning bed.

At first he came home exhausted but “mentally brighter,” says Magaly Rodriguez, the UM surgeon in charge of Nick’s hyperbaric course. “By the end of the first week I was very encouraged. He was lighter on his feet, more focused, sharper.”

But on March 11 Buoniconti fell again while walking his dog, cutting and bruising his head, hand and elbow and requiring five stitches in one leg. His temper flared again, and the dizzy spells hit; he began to dread going inside the chamber. All signs of progress faded. On the night of March 26 Rodriguez was at home. She watched the movie Concussion, again, and prayed for Nick Buoniconti.

“We have to find a way to stop the progression of this ailment,” she says. “I remember watching him as a child, growing up [in Miami]. It’s a labor of love.”

The next morning, Buoniconti phoned four times to say that he would meet me at the chamber at 10:30 a.m. “Did I already call you?” he said after the third. After having viewed his stagnant results and rising anxiety, Rodriguez decided that, after 25 sessions, it was time to hit pause. She recommended Buoniconti undergo a new round of cognitive tests. He was relieved, really, but still sighed: another dead end.

Waiting for Nick's car outside the hospital, the building that holds Buoniconti's monument—the Miami Project—loomed tall and white across the street. Later, at a nearby Starbucks, Lynn mulled a rushed retrofit of their bathroom, the mechanics of arranging 24-hour in-home care. Nick ate cheese and crackers and said his dizziness had passed. At one point he stood, one of the great names of a generation, and asked for help slipping his phone into his front-left pocket. The table went quiet, and he sat again.

“I really would like to know what the hell is going on,” Buoniconti said. Outside a breeze pushed the palms just enough so you could hear them. “But I’m going to deteriorate anyway, so do we go back to UCLA? I’m up in the air.”

6,Rep ends interview when pressed on IDs for town halls,"Story highlights Rod Blum represents a competitive district in eastern Iowa

He required attendees to ""verify residency"" at his Monday event by showing that they live in his district

Washington (CNN) An Iowa congressman abruptly ended an interview moments after it started when pressed why he was requiring town hall attendees to prove they are his constituents.

""This is ridiculous,"" said Rod Blum, an Iowa Republican as he removed the microphone attached to his shirt, stood up and exited the room. ""This is ridiculous.""

Blum, who represents a competitive district in eastern Iowa, was seated in a classroom surrounded by grade-school children as he spoke in Dubuque with KCRG reporter Josh Scheinblum. As town halls grow chaotic across the country due to divisions over whether to replace Obamacare, Blum required attendees to ""verify residency"" at his Monday event by showing that they live in his district, according to a town hall Eventbrite page.

""Some would make the case that you represent all Iowans. The decisions that you make impact all Iowans. So shouldn't all Iowans have a voice at the table?"" Scheinblum asked.

""I don't represent all Iowans,"" Blum said with a laugh. ""I represent the 1st District of Iowa. That'd be like saying: 'Shouldn't I be able to -- even though I live in Dubuque -- go vote in Iowa City during the election because I'd like to vote in that district instead?'""

1. Pooping during childbirth is pretty common. Yeah, it happens. It's a shitty deal. 2. Functioning on literally no sleep every day is actually possible. Not just functioning, but keeping another another human alive. NBD. 3. Doing things with one hand is one of your best skills. You become a master at holding a baby, making a bottle, unloading the dishwasher, and talking on the phone all at the same time. 4. The baby isn't the only thing you deliver during childbirth. After you deliver the baby, you deliver the placenta. ""Here's your beautiful baby and here's your beautiful placenta!"" But the placenta is not beautiful. It looks like an uncooked pot roast. 5. Being puked on is a daily occurrence. Being shit on is also a frequent occurrence. 6. Your vagina isn't forever ruined after vaginal childbirth. IT SHRINKS BACK. This is not a ""hotdog down a hallway"" type of situation, people!

7. Silence is always, ALWAYS suspicious. 8. Your baby ""bump"" doesn't automatically shrink up after the baby comes out. You don't SUDDENLY have a flat stomach after birth! 9.

Jeter, whose No. 2 will be retired and enshrined in Monument Park before Sunday’s game at Yankee Stadium, has just one regret. From the New York Post:

“I really haven’t [reflected on my career]. I really haven’t sat back and reflected. Someone asked me recently, do I have any regrets in my career? My last season, I kept a journal; every day I’d write something in there,’’ Jeter told YES Network in a sit-down interview with Jack Curry that aired after Monday’s game against the Reds.

“The one regret I do have is that I wish I would’ve done that my entire career, because there are so many things that you forget. Still to this day I haven’t looked at it. It’s locked up and I haven’t looked. I’m going to be a father soon, so I’m sure one day when I sit down with my kid — or kids, if there’s multiple — I’ll get a chance to reflect and maybe brag like my dad used to do when I was younger.”

Jeter retired after the 2014 season with five World Series rings, a .310/.377/.440 slash line and 3,465 hits – but only one journal.

3,Irish police drop Stephen Fry blasphemy probe,"Image copyright PA

Police in the Republic of Ireland are no longer investigating a claim that British comedian Stephen Fry uttered blasphemous remarks on a TV show.

Irish media say the Garda dropped the case as there was no injured party.

A viewer had complained about comments made by Fry on a TV show in 2015.

Fry had asked why he should ""respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world.... full of injustice"". He later said he was not ""offensive towards any particular religion"".

News of the Irish investigation on Saturday caused a big stir on social media. The clip of Fry's interview was watched more than seven million times on YouTube.

A controversial law against blasphemy was introduced in 2009. It carries a maximum penalty of a fine of €25,000 (£22,000).

Viewer 'now satisfied'

Speaking to the Irish Independent newspaper, the man who had accused Fry said: ""I did my civic duty in reporting it.

""The guards did their duty in investigating it. I am satisfied with the result.""

The paper says no publicised cases of blasphemy have been brought before the courts since the law was introduced.

In a TV show called The Meaning of Life, hosted by Gay Byrne, Fry had been asked what he might say to God at the gates of heaven.

Fry said: ""How dare you create a world in which there is such misery? It's not our fault? It's not right. It's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?""

In 2009 the then government said the law was needed because the republic's 1937 constitution gave only Christians legal protection of their beliefs.",bbc-news

9,Michael Vick says kids can learn from Joe Mixon’s situation | FOX Sports,"The Cincinnati Bengals took a big risk in the second round of the draft, selecting Joe Mixon out of Oklahoma. The pick was met with plenty of criticism due to Mixon’s character concerns, stemming from an incident in which he punched a woman, breaking four bones in her face.

The Bengals are giving him a second chance, as they often do with troubled players. Someone who’s familiar with getting a second opportunity in the NFL is Michael Vick. He served 18 months in prison for dogfighting, only to return to the field in 2009 with the Eagles, and later with the Jets and Steelers.

He shared his thoughts on the Mixon situation, saying kids can learn from what happened to the new Bengals running back.

“Kids can use this as an example,” Vick told NJ Advance Media recently. “Joe got an opportunity because he’s an exceptional talent. Others don’t get that opportunity.”

AP

Vick would obviously never condone what Mixon did, but hopes he can learn from his situation and his mistake to take advantage of the second chance he’s received.

“Joe’s young, man, and he made a mistake. Let’s be honest, you rarely see guys having encounters like that. It should never happen. I would never condone it. I don’t think it’s right at all,” Vick said. “But in terms of his football career, if he could go back and think about it before he actually made that gesture towards that girl, he wouldn’t have done it. Not if he knew what he would be dealing with now. … I think he has learned from it. Hopefully, he’s humbled by what happened to him.”

The Bengals openly admitted that they took a risk on Mixon in the second round, knowing the criticism that would come along with the selection. Mixon himself has showed remorse for his wrongdoing, saying he’s changed since the incident occurred in 2014.

He was suspended from the football team for all of 2015 and saw his draft stock plummet as a result. Mixon is a first-round talent, but he needs to prove he can be a good member of the community and change his image.",fox-sports

And seeing as his entire career has been at the highest level, against the best teams in the world, he’s made jersey swaps with most of the best players of his era. None of this is surprising.

What we didn’t know is that Messi has an entire room in his home dedicated to displaying all those jerseys he’s gotten (and a few of his own).

A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) on May 9, 2017 at 12:26am PDT

Some of these jerseys are pretty obvious. Of course he has Francesco Totti, Diego Milito, Philipp Lahm, Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero jerseys. It is a little bit surprising that he crossed rivalry lines for Iker Casillas, Raul and Angel D Maria jerseys, though. Of course, there’s no Cristiano Ronaldo jersey to be found.

It looks like the ceiling might be where he keeps his most treasured jerseys, too. Up there he has Thierry Henry, Petr Nedved, Cesc Fabregas and Deco. Not bad.

Being Lionel Messi has its perks. Like unreal jersey collections, and a room to display them.

6,This congressman had a worse Monday than you,"(CNN) Rod Blum held a master class Monday on how not to handle yourself during a Congressional recess.

It all started with an interview with a local TV station. Blum, an Iowa Republican, was surrounded by kids at a youth center when KCRG-TV9's Josh Scheinblum started asking questions -- beginning with one about why Blum was limiting attendees of his town hall Monday night to residents of his 1st district. Things rapidly went downhill

Blum's hair trigger is totally baffling here. Scheinblum isn't even being confrontational! He's simply (lightly) pressing Blum on not allowing certain Iowa residents into a town hall meeting. His follow-up question -- would you accept contributions from people outside the district? -- is totally fair.

Blum's contention that Scheinblum was ""going to sit here and just badger me"" suggests to me that the congressman doesn't know what badgering actually entails -- since that ain't it.

9,Judge throws out Aaron Hernandez's conviction in 2013 murder | FOX Sports,"FALL RIVER, Mass. — Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez’s conviction in a 2013 murder can be erased because he died before his appeal was heard, a judge ruled Tuesday.

Judge E. Susan Garsh said a legal doctrine that calls for vacating convictions when a defendant dies before an appeal can be heard was binding precedent. She said she was compelled to follow it.

The former New England Patriots tight end hanged himself in his prison cell last month while serving a life sentence in the killing of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd.

Prosecutor Patrick Bomberg had argued that Hernandez “should not be able to accomplish in death what he could not accomplish in life.”

Hernandez’s appellate attorney told the judge that the state’s highest court has applied the legal doctrine “without exception,” even in cases of suicide.

In a court filing last week, Bristol District Attorney Thomas Quinn III argued that a defendant’s death while an appeal is pending does not always require what is known as “abatement,” including when “a defendant’s death is a result of his own conscious, deliberate and voluntary act.”

Hernandez’s appellate lawyers say his conviction in the Lloyd case is not considered final because the automatic appeal he was entitled to had not been heard at the time of his death.

Hernandez, who grew up in Bristol, Connecticut, and played football at the University of Florida, was considered an up-and-coming star during his three seasons with the Patriots. He was cut from the team hours after his arrest in the killing of Lloyd.",fox-sports
6,Trump fires FBI director James Comey,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election.

The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.

The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.

In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal there would be no backlash.

What was not thought through apparently was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe.

In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was re-opening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency.

Comey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation.

The letters

In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,"" Trump told Comey in the letter. ""I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.""

At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.

JUST WATCHED Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' 01:03

Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to ""usurp the attorney general's authority"" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution.

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein argued in his memo.

""We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),"" Rosenstein said. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

Congressional reaction

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President?"" Schumer asked

And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading an Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a ""loss for the bureau and the nation.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,"" Burr said.

As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed.

""I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general is competent to lead that effort,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership.

But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would ""raise questions.""

Sen. John McCain added: ""While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.""

The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations.

'Absurd'

CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was ""absurd.""

Toobin branded the move a ""grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.""

""This is not something that is within the American political tradition,"" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.

""This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,"" Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director.

The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25.

A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.

Team Clinton reaction

Former Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation.

""I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called ""charade"" only 24 hours ago,"" said Clinton's former campaign manager Robby Mook.

""It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,"" he said.

One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Scuitto.

""I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,"" the person said.

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials say they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they are shocked by the development.

Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President.

Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin ""forwarded hundreds and thousands"" of emails to her husband's laptop.

The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the ""hundreds and thousands of emails"" that Comey said were 'forwarded"" from Abedin to her husband's email ""included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.""

The White House said it will immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions.

Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world.

In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did.

But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election, put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight.

Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being ""extremely careless"" with sensitive information.

Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the ""political"" decision.

Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had re-opened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges.

After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part.

Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: ""I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.""

After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.

He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief.

""Oh, here's Jim,"" Trump said in January. ""He's become more famous than me.""",cnn

6,"Clinton aides react to Comey firing with concern, not joy","Washington (CNN) There were few people who despised James Comey more than those political operatives working for Hillary Clinton in Brooklyn during the 2016 campaign. But word of the FBI director's firing was met with fear, not joy, on Tuesday.

Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton's running mate, Robby Mook, the former secretary of state's campaign manager and Brian Fallon, her press secretary, all expressed skepticism at why Comey was fired now -- in the midst of the bureau's investigation into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.

""Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation,"" Kaine tweeted in response to the news. ""Comey firing part of a growing pattern by White House to cover-up the truth.""

Mook, who has been markedly critical of Comey since the 2016 election, tweeted that he was ""surprised"" by the fact that he can't see ""how this bodes well for the Russia investigation.""

""I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called 'charade' only 24 hours ago,"" Mook said in a statement. ""It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing.""

6,Comey firing troubles top Republicans lawmakers,"(CNN) Top Republicans, including the senator directing the Senate's Russia investigation, said Tuesday they were ""troubled"" by President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey , while other GOP lawmakers tried to stay out of the growing political storm.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said in a statement.

While Democrats slammed Trump's decision on Comey as ""Nixonian,"" some members of the President's own party expressed concerns and divided traditional GOP alliances.

Arizona Sen. John McCain said he was ""disappointed"" by the incident. Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and occasionally advised the Trump campaign last year, said he also had concerns.

Rep. Justin Amash, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said in a tweet that he would introduce legislation supporting the creation of an independent commission to investigate Russia's interference in the election.

Amash is one of four Republicans who have signed on to legislation that would force Trump to release his tax returns.

""While the case for removal of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions,"" Corker said in a statement. ""It is essential that ongoing investigations are fulsome and free of political interference until their completion, and it is imperative that President Trump nominate a well-respected and qualified individual to lead the bureau at this critical time.""

Other Republicans came to Trump's defense or placed the blame for Comey's firing squarely on the shoulders of the former FBI director.

""Today's announcement is likely the inevitable conclusion of Director Comey's decision last July to bypass the longstanding protocols of the Justice Department and publicly announce the reasons he had decided not to recommend an indictment of Hillary Clinton and to offer his personal views of Mrs. Clinton's actions,"" Republican Sen. Susan Collins said in a statement.

""Any suggestion that today's announcement is somehow an effort to stop the FBI's investigation of Russia's attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced,"" Collins said. ""The President did not fire the entire FBI; he fired the director.""

The decision also had two traditional Republican allies apparently at odds. While McCain said Comey is ""a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" one of his closest friends -- Sen. Lindsey Graham -- said that he disagreed.

The South Carolina Republican, who is leading one of four investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, said Tuesday he supports Trump's decision.

""Given the recent controversies surrounding the director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well,"" Graham said in a statement Tuesday. ""I encourage the President to select the most qualified professional available who will serve our nation's interests.""

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he was not commenting on the firing specifically but expected the Justice Department's investigation to continue largely unchanged.

""I would expect the FBI to continue to function along the lines that we have come to expect it to function,"" the Florida Republican told CNN.",cnn

(CNN) Democratic senators sharply criticized President Donald Trump's decision to fire FBI director James Comey on Tuesday, with some calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian meddling into the 2016 US election and any connection to Trump's aides.

""Mr. President, with all due respect, you are making a big mistake,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters he told Trump when the President called him earlier.

Schumer added that it's time for a special prosecutor to lead an investigation and that ""this investigation must be run as far away as possible from this White House.""

Prominent Democrats across Washington cited former President Richard Nixon's behavior more than 40 years ago to describe Trump's decision to sack Comey following the recommendation of the attorney general and deputy attorney general.

""This is Nixonian,"" Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey said in a statement. ""Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein must immediately appoint a special counsel to continue the Trump/Russia investigation.""

3,FBI chief James Comey fired by Trump,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Trump previously praised Comey as brave

President Donald Trump has fired the director of the FBI over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails, the administration says.

The White House shocked Washington by announcing that James Comey ""has been terminated and removed from office"".

But Democrats said he was fired because the FBI was investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The move came as it emerged Mr Comey gave inaccurate information about Mrs Clinton's emails to Congress last week.

Live coverage of FBI chief's firing

Decoding Comey's testimony

President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that ""you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau"".

Mr Sessions said the Department of Justice was ""committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law"", and ""a fresh start is needed"".

The White House said the search for a successor would begin immediately.

Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when he was handed a note by one of his team informing him he had just been fired.

The 56-year-old - who was four years into his 10-year term as FBI director - broke the news to his staff.

Why does the administration say Comey was fired?

Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the Clinton emails investigation, given that Mr Trump formerly praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.

In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump told a rally it ""took guts"" for Mr Comey to reopen the inquiry. ""What he did brought back his reputation,"" Mr Trump said.

But on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he ""cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken"".

""Almost everyone agrees the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives"".

He said Mr Comey had been wrong to ""usurp"" the previous attorney general in July 2016 to announce the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution.

The deputy attorney general said Mr Comey compounded his error by ""gratuitously"" releasing ""derogatory information"" about Mrs Clinton.

What about the Russia investigation?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer: ""Mr President, with all due respect, you're making a big mistake""

Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into Russian whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.

The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are investigating the same allegations.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference.

""This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" he added.

And it is not just Democrats who expressed concern.

Richard Burr, the Republican head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Jim Comey's termination.""

The development is drawing comparisons with President Richard Nixon's firing of his attorney general, which plunged his presidency deeper into turmoil.

But President Trump has repeatedly insisted the Russian allegations are ""fake news"".

A cover-up? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump and senior Justice Department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support.

Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree. The president didn't help his cause by specifically asserting that he was ""not under investigation"" in his letter to Mr Comey.

Already Democrats are clamouring for the ex-director to testify before Congress about the state of the FBI's Russia investigation at the time of his dismissal.

Just days after becoming president, Mr Trump shook Mr Comey's hand at a White House event and said ""he's become more famous than me"". That may have been an exaggeration at the time.

It seems less like one now.

How did Comey handle the email inquiry?

Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.

The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.

He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.

He told the Senate last week it made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again.

Mrs Clinton blames Mr Comey for her shock election defeat last November to Donald Trump.

Mr Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails, ""some of which contain classified information"", to her then-husband.

But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had only sent two email chains containing classified information to her husband for printing.

The clarification was made in a letter from the FBI's assistant director of congressional affairs, Gregory Brower, to the congressional committee.

The majority of the 49,000 emails investigators uncovered on the computer of Ms Abedin's husband Anthony Weiner were transferred via backup of her work Blackberry device, Mr Brower wrote.

Ultimately, all 12 classified email chains found on Mr Weiner's device were determined to have been duplicates previously reviewed by investigators.",bbc-news
6,Conservative election expenses charging decision due,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The way the Conservatives' ""battle bus"" spending was recorded is being investigated

Prosecutors are expected to announce on Wednesday whether Conservative politicians or officials will face charges for breaches of expenses rules.

The CPS is considering files sent by police following investigations in up to 27 constituencies.

It relates to claims some campaigning costs in the 2015 general election were wrongly recorded.

The Conservative Party has insisted administrative errors were to blame rather than any intention to deceive.

And it has said some of the spending was correctly declared.

Complex rules

It is alleged the Conservatives spent tens of thousands of pounds on local campaigns - including on ""battle bus"" visits by activists - which were either not declared or were wrongly registered as national spending.

The allegations came to light following an investigation by Channel 4 News.

Under complex election spending rules, parties must disclose national spending separately from money used to promote each candidate, and separate national and local limits apply.

Up to 16 police forces across England have submitted files to be considered by prosecutors.

The CPS will consider whether there is sufficient evidence of a breach in the law, and whether a prosecution is ""in the public interest"".

If general election candidates are prosecuted the Conservative Party will have to decide whether to suspend them and replace them as nominees.

The last date for candidates to register for the election is 11 May.

6,General election 2017: Labour and Lib Dems pledge school cash,"Image copyright PA

Labour and the Lib Dems are both making multibillion pound funding pledges to tackle school cash shortages in England.

Labour says it would raise corporation tax to spend £4.8bn on keeping up with rising costs, and £335m so no schools lost out from a funding reorganisation.

The Lib Dems are promising £7bn to protect per-pupil funding levels.

The Conservatives said school spending had reached record levels and attacked the two parties' spending plans.

Headteachers have been warning about job losses caused by cash shortages, with the National Audit Office estimating schools will have to cut £3bn from budgets by 2019-20 to meet rising cost pressures.

A new funding formula will also see some schools lose money, although others will gain.

On Monday, the Institute of Fiscal Studies said protecting schools from real-terms cuts in England would mean spending the equivalent of an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner are promising a real-terms funding increase in schools and ""free lifelong education"" in colleges, including restoring the Educational Maintenance Allowance.

This would be paid for by increasing corporation tax from the current 19% to 26% by 2021, Labour said.

""We will invest in schools and in our young people, ensuring no primary pupils go hungry during the day, reducing class sizes so children can learn and teachers can teach, and restoring the maintenance allowance and grants for students in both further and higher education,"" Ms Rayner said.

The Lib Dems claimed their plans went further than Labour's and said details of how they would funded would be provided ""in due course"" in the party's manifesto.

The party said it would also protect further education per-pupil funding in real terms.

'Made-up promises'

Lib Dem education spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: ""While funding per pupil is set to see the biggest cuts in a generation, billions of pounds are being spent on divisive plans to expand grammars and free schools.

""This extra £7bn of funding would ensure no school and no child loses out.""

The Conservatives said Labour had already committed the corporation tax rise to other projects.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said Labour's announcement was ""just made-up promises on the back of nonsensical spending plans"".

He added: ""The Lib Dems are no better and won't even tell people about the tax rises they would bring in.""

As education is a devolved matter, the pledges relate to England only, and the amount Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receives would be determined by the funding formula.",bbc-news

9,Juventus 2-1 Monaco (4-1 agg),"Dani Alves has been involved in seven Champions League goals this season, more than any other defender

Juventus reached their second Champions League final in three seasons with a comfortable aggregate victory over Monaco.

Already leading 2-0 from the first leg, the Italian side extended their advantage when Mario Mandzukic stabbed in after his initial header was saved.

Dani Alves doubled their lead on the night with an instinctive volley from goalkeeper Danijel Subasic's punched clearance.

Kylian Mbappe turned in Joao Moutinho's low cross to pull one back in the second half, but the Ligue 1 side could not pull off an unlikely comeback.

Juventus, who have not won this competition since 1996 and lost 3-1 to Barcelona in the 2015 final, will face either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid in Cardiff on 3 June.

Atletico host Real on Wednesday looking to overturn a 3-0 first-leg deficit.

Is this Juventus' year?

Juventus beat Ajax on penalties to win the Champions League in 1996

Juventus have endured a turbulent time since beating Ajax in the Champions League final 21 years ago.

They were demoted to Serie B in 2006 for their part in a match-fixing scandal, and were stripped of two of their Serie A titles.

But they have risen to become the most dominant team in Italy, winning the league for each of the past five seasons.

Their focus now is Champions League success - and they look well placed to achieve it.

No side has scored more than a single goal against them in a Champions League game this season, while Mbappe's goal was the first they have conceded in the knockout stage.

That is down to the excellent form of goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and defensive trio Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli.

Against a free-scoring Monaco side intent on attacking, lesser sides may have relented, but Juve stood firm.

Chiellini, in particular, was outstanding - in the right place to clear a dangerous Benjamin Mendy cross at 0-0 before hooking away from Radamel Falcao at 1-0.

They were two key moments, allowing Juve's forward players to attack with patience and potency.

Kylian Mbappe's goal was the first Juventus had conceded in 689 minutes of Champions League football

Alves excellent again

When Barcelona dismantled Juventus in the Champions League final two years ago, Alves was a key part of the Spanish side.

The full-back, who won six La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues with Barcelona, left under acrimonious circumstances last summer and joined Juventus on a free transfer.

There is no doubt Barca's loss has been Juve's gain.

After a slow start, the Brazilian has developed into one of the club's most influential players, and his Champions League experience has been pivotal to Juventus' run to the final.

Having assisted both of Gonzalo Higuain's goals in the first leg he produced a brilliant strike here, calmly guiding Subasic's looped clearance through a crowded box and into the net.

Alves, whose cross also led to Mandzukic's opener, has now been involved in every goal Juve have scored in their last two Champions League games.

Man of the match - Dani Alves

Alves was excellent in the first half, scoring one goal and assisting the other to effectively put the tie beyond Monaco

Unrivalled Juve - the stats

No team has reached the Champions League final on more occasions than Juventus (six - level with AC Milan).

Juve have scored 30 goals in the Champions League semi-finals; no team has scored more (level with Bayern and Real Madrid).

The Turin club are unbeaten in 12 Champions League/European Cup games for the first time in their history (W9 D3).

Mandzukic ended his longest run without a Champions League goal (six games) and is now on 15 in 45 appearances.

Mbappe's goal was Monaco's 150th this season in all competitions; only Real Madrid (158) and Barcelona (160) have scored more from the big five European leagues.

Mbappe became the youngest player to score in a Champions League semi-final (18 years & 140 days).

Thierry Henry (five games) is the only French player to have reached six Champions League goals quicker than Kylian Mbappe (nine).

What next?

Juventus have three games remaining in Serie A, starting with a trip to Roma on Sunday, 14 May. A draw will seal a sixth consecutive league title.

Monaco, meanwhile, switch their focus to domestic matters as they look to win Ligue 1. They are three points clear of Paris St-Germain with three games left and host Lille on Sunday.",bbc-news
3,Syria war: US to arm Kurds in battle for Raqqa,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption US special forces have been supporting SDF units on the ground

US President Donald Trump has approved supplying weapons to Kurdish forces fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria, the Pentagon says.

Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would be equipped to help drive IS from its stronghold, Raqqa, a spokeswoman said.

The US was ""keenly aware"" of Turkey's concerns about such a move, she added.

Turkey views the Kurdish rebels as terrorists and wants to stop them taking more territory in Syria.

The Pentagon later said US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had spoken by phone to his Turkish counterpart, Fikri Isik, but gave no details of the conversation. Turkish officials have not yet responded publicly.

SDF forces, which comprise Kurdish and Arab militias, are already being supported by elite US forces and air strikes from a US-led coalition.

The US has previously supplied light weapons and armoured vehicles to the Arab element of the SDF, known as the Syrian Arab Coalition.

The SDF is currently battling IS for control of the city of Tabqa, an IS command centre just 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa.

The Kurdish fighters are from the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades.

Last month, Turkey carried out air strikes on YPG positions in Syria which it described as ""terrorist havens"".

Analysis: Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington

The US believes the Kurdish fighters will be essential to Raqqa's downfall.

The Pentagon sees them as the most disciplined and organised of the anti-IS groups but Turkish opposition has meant Washington has had to tread a fine line.

The imminence of the fight for the city means delay is no longer an option and the Kurds will be getting a range of equipment.

US sources say they have received assurances from the Kurds that they will leave Raqqa to be governed by Syrian Arabs after the battle.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is due in Washington next week - he will not be a happy visitor.

A Pentagon source told the BBC the equipment would include ammunition, small arms, machine guns, heavy machine guns, construction equipment such as bulldozers and armoured vehicles.

The source added that the US would ""seek to recover"" the equipment afterwards.

No timeline has been given for when the weapons would start to be supplied.

""We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey,"" said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, who is travelling with Mr Mattis in Lithuania.

""We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the US is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our Nato ally.""

10,Microsoft Build 2017: what to expect in major Windows 10 news,"Moved temporarily a few months back and physically a few hundred miles north compared to last year, Microsoft’s Build 2017 developer conference is nearly underway.

With the first keynote set to start on May 10 at 8am PT (11am ET / 4pm BST / 1am May 11 AEST) from Seattle, Washington, Microsoft has plenty to chat about this year despite holding a major media event just last week to tout Windows 10 S and the Surface Laptop.

The most notable topics we expect to see detailed are Redstone 3, the codename for Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update, Project Neon, Microsoft’s visual makeover-in-progress for the operating system (OS), Cortana and even more mixed reality advancements.

With that, here is everything we can bank on seeing during the Build 2017 keynotes starting May 10.

Redstone 3 gets unearthed

Microsoft’s Windows Insider Program members are, technically, already testing out Redstone 3 as you read this. We know this because features that were originally slated for Redstone 2, i.e. the Creators Update, but missed the deadline are now in testing through the latest Insider Preview build of Windows 10 (as of this writing): Build 16188.

Chief among those features left on the Creators Update cutting room floor is My People, a feature that brings your favorite contacts directly into the Windows 10 taskbar for easier file sharing and messaging. Expect to see more of this discussed on stage this week.

Other major expected features to be detailed are PDF editing features in Microsoft Edge (already in the latest Insider Preview build), Power Throttling to reduce apps’ power draw on laptops and tablet PCs and further improvements to more transparent automated OS updates.

We also wouldn’t be surprised to see Redstone 3 get its official name and, at the very least, a release window (if not a hard date) since Microsoft has promised two major updates annually.

Cortana branches out

That Harman Kardon unveiled its Invoke speaker powered by Microsoft’s Cortana just days before Build 2017 is no coincidence. With the long-rumored rival to Amazon Echo and Google Home now out in the open, expect Microsoft to spend some considerable time on this initiative.

In fact, controls for Cortana-powered speakers were already found within the earliest Insider Preview builds for Redstone 3. On that note, expect to hear a lot more about how far the Amazon Alexa-like Cortana Skills and device software developer kits have come since their announcement last year.

However, we find it hard to believe that Microsoft will sit on these tools until Redstone 3 becomes a fancy-named update that hits every Windows 10 device. After all, don’t expect Amazon and Google – or even the rumored Apple Siri Speaker – to slow down over the next five months.

Project Neon ... or Aero Glass 2.0

Microsoft’s fateful fall update should see the oft-teased visual overhaul to the Windows 10 interface known currently as Project Neon.

In short, the new visuals bring back a lot of the translucent design elements found in the Aero Glass design ID that started in Windows Vista and were found throughout Windows 7 before being dropped for Windows 8.

Furthermore, Project Neon markedly changes how Windows 10 animations in transitioning between apps look and feel. That said, early previews have stated that Neon is aiming for a simple aesthetic, so we’ll see how Microsoft achieves that balance with new animations in the mix.

Mixed reality gets a huge push

Unless Microsoft plans to give them a spotlight during its May 23 Surface event, Build 2017 would be the place to show even more of its partners’ head-mounted displays (HMDs).

Having already shown off Acer’s HMD at length during the Taiwanese firm’s annual New York hardware showcase, it’d be surprising not to see already-teased partners like Lenovo, Dell and HP not take the chance to get the word out regarding their Windows 10 Holographic devices.

Bonus round: maybe we’ll finally hear about price regarding any of Microsoft’s partners’ HMD devices. It’s a crucial point going into the holiday season, especially when it’s highly unlikely that either HTC or Facebook have 2017 hardware that can match that $299 starting price.",techradar

10,Has Meizu's quick charge tech reinvented the smartphone?,"Do you carry a portable charger for your smartphone? They seem innocent enough, but those small black boxes are like a sticking plaster over the tech industry's gaping wound; pathetic phone batteries not fit for the modern mobile age.

It's not just the Pokémon Go app that drains the life from smartphones, with navigation apps like Google Maps, firmware updates, and even just the camera app eating away at battery life at a worrying rate.

So could a claim by Chinese phone maker Meizu that it now has the technology to recharge a phone in less than 20 minutes change everything?

Super mCharge is expected to be used in phones inside two years. © Jamie Carter

Short battery life is a huge problem for the phone industry, whose minor improvements in power efficiency have been swallowed up by the ever-increasing size of smartphone screens.

""Smartphones have become more power-hungry, and battery life and charging technology has failed to keep pace, leaving users often unsatisfied with the battery life of their devices,"" says James Manning Smith, Information Analyst at Futuresource Consulting.

He points out that manufacturers have three choices when designing a phone; larger batteries in devices, more efficient components, and making charging more convenient for users.

Meizu has taken the middle road with its Super mCharge technology, which it unveiled at a press event at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona. The live demo saw an empty smartphone fill-up in precisely 18 minutes and 55 seconds.

Not exactly a riveting watch for onlookers, but impressive nonetheless. After over a year of R&D, said Meizu, it had improved the power of a Super mCharge battery to 55W, and accelerated charging speed by 5.5 times.

© Jamie Carter

An industry first

That 55W figure is key. “Meizu's 55W charging is a first for the mobile industry,” says Manning Smith, who confirms that it's a more powerful charging solution than anything already on the market.

“Standard USB charging is 5W, while some OEMs have released phones with 15-18W charging, such as Motorola, Samsung and Oppo.”

The battery inside the Meizu demo phone was 3,000mAh, which is a typical size for a smartphone (for comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8 uses a 3,000mAh battery, while the iPhone 7 claims a 1,960mAh battery), though this one was specially designed by Meizu's engineers to bear more than four times the current so it could work with Super mCharge.

So what has Meizu actually achieved here? As well as taking charging to 55W, Meizu has dramatically accelerated the charging speed.

Technically speaking, Super mCharge uses charge pump technology; comprising two groups of circuits, the charge pump exports half of the voltage after transformation and improves efficiency by 8%.

""Our solution yields 98% efficiency, compared with other companies who struggle to hit 90%,"" claims Meizu.

Super mCharge also uses a USB cable that's been redesigned to carry up to 160W of power, and as a result it does cost three times more than a regular USB cable.

Can the Meizu phone stand the heat?

There are two immediate concerns. Firstly, does fast charging mean the battery won't last very long? Secondly, is all that extra heat generated safe? After all, exploding batteries in smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 have made us all nervous.

On the first question, Meizu insists that in tests its 3,000mAh battery retained more than 80 percent of its capacity after 800 charge and discharge cycles, so it should be good for two years' normal use.

On the second concern about safety, Meizu claims that its optimization algorithm means the highest temperature the battery reaches is 39°C/102°F (in an ambient temperature of 22°C/72°F), just a bit higher than body temperature.

Manning Smith explains that since smartphones are very condensed devices, engineering restrictions mean the heat that builds up during high-powered charging can damage the battery, and other components in the phone.

""Meizu has developed a technology that allows the battery to be charged at a very high rate, without exceeding dangerous temperature levels,"" he adds.

Quick Charge 4.0 features on the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. © Jamie Carter

This is all impressive stuff, but only if the device can live up to Meizu's promises. ""Once the technology comes to market, it has the potential to set a new standard for wired smartphone charging,"" says Manning Smith.

That should happen during 2019 or 2020, but there's no guaranteed success for Super mCharge. Not only are several other similar innovations expected in that time-frame, but the general trend towards super-fast wired charging for phones looks set to be overtaken by the wireless charging era.

When it comes to super-fast wired charging, Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 (QC3.0) for Android devices is the current front-runner, with QC4.0 just announced for new flagship Android phones that use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset – and that includes the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, ZTE Gigabit and some versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8.

QC4.0 claims to charge 20% faster than QC3.0 (which charges an empty phone to 50% in about 30 minutes). That's not as impressive as Super mCharge's promised speeds, but then again it's available already.

Can Meizu's technology compete with wireless pads?

""Wireless charging companies are trying to [create] a world in which charging cables are unnecessary,"" says Manning Smith, who admits that support for wireless charging pads in wider society is in its infancy.

However, Aircharge has been installing wireless charging stations in restaurants, airports and hotels, while IKEA is including wireless charging pads in some furniture.

""Should we see an increase in the availability of wireless charging outlets in our daily lives, there may be less need for fast charging technologies,"" Manning Smith says.

There are also efforts to develop high-wattage wireless charging. Bosch has wireless charging for power tools that it plans to take up to 60W and use in all kinds of mobile devices by 2020, which would surpass Meizu's achievement – while LG has been developing wireless charging pads that bring a fully discharged phone up to 50% in 30 minutes, (so on a par with QC3.0).

“The convenience of cable-free, little-and-often charges that wireless charging can provide may be more convincing for consumers than wired, but quick charging,” says Manning Smith.

So while Meizu's Super mCharge is an exciting achievement, the future belongs not to electrochemical cells, but wireless charging pads – probably starting with your car.",techradar
6,Democrats call for independent Russia probe in wake of Comey firing,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump fired the Director of the FBI. Veuer's Nick Cardona (@nickcardona93) has that story. Buzz60

WASHINGTON — President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey in the middle of several investigations of possible Trump campaign ties to last year’s Russian meddling in U.S. elections caused a firestorm of protest from Democratic members of Congress, with many calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

Some equated the firing with events known as the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" during the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he told Trump that he had made a “big mistake” when informed of the decision.

Schumer wondered aloud whether the firing meant Comey’s investigation was “getting too close to home,” and he said the handling of a credible investigation depends on Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein naming a “fearless, independent” special prosecutor.

“Mr. Rosenstein, America depends on you to restore faith in our criminal justice system which is going to be badly shattered after the administration’s actions today,"" Schumer said.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona called for the creation of a special congressional committee on Russia, while Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said he and his staff were ""reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia.""

""James Comey is a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" McCain said.

Comey, a Republican who had served in the George W. Bush administration as second in command in the Justice Department, was the surprise choice of President Barack Obama for the FBI post.

He had established his independence in March 2004 when then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales sought to get Comey’s boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft, to sign off on a secret National Security Agency wiretap program. Ashcroft, seriously ill in the hospital with pancreatitis, had turned his duties over to Comey, who told Gonzales in Ashcroft’s hospital room that he refused to authorize the program.

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the troubled House intelligence committee, said the firing raised profound questions about White House interference in a criminal probe.

“The decision by a president whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an Attorney General who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,” Schiff said, likening the event to the Watergate firings.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., suggested Trump’s action poses serious constitutional issues, while others called the development “Nixonian.”

“The termination and removal of James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raises the critical question as to whether the FBI investigation of Russian interference in the last presidential campaign will continue,” Durbin said.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate committee probing the Trump-Russia connection, called the firing “outrageous.”

“I have been long been a critic of Director Comey ... but Donald Trump’s decision to fire him now, in the midst of an investigation into Trump associates and their ties to Russia, is outrageous,"" Wyden said. He said Comey should be called to testify before Congress about the status of the Trump-Russia investigation.

“The president would do well to remember that in America, the truth always comes out.”

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who questioned Comey at a hearing before a Judiciary subcommittee this week, said the way Trump is handling the firing “is shocking.”

“No one should accept President Trump’s absurd justification that he is now concerned that FBI Director Comey treated Secretary Clinton unfairly,” Leahy said. “The president has removed the sitting FBI Director in the midst of one of the most critical national security investigations in the history of our country. This is nothing less than Nixonian.”

Leahy also noted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom the president consulted before the firing, was supposed to have recused himself. He said Rosenstein now has no choice but to appoint a special counsel.

A long list of others calling for an independent probe included Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Ben Cardin, D-Md., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., along with good government advocacy groups MoveOn.org and Common Cause.

Others reacted with more measured tones. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said simply that she had been informed by the president of his decision by phone, adding, “the next FBI director must be strong and independent and will receive a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee.”

One of the earliest Republican reactions came from Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn.: “While the case for removal of (FBI Director Comey) laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions.""

News of Comey’s departure came near the end of an hourlong telephone town hall meeting that House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., was having with constituents. “Lisa in Mendham” said she wanted to know what Congress was going to do now to hold Trump accountable “for his potentially breaking the law in dealing with Russia.”

Frelinghuysen didn’t answer that question directly but gave a positive appraisal of the job Comey has done.

“He had the reputation ... like his predecessor Robert Muller, of being a sort of straight-arrow guy,” Frelinghuysen said. “I do think he was an honorable man and represented an amazing department. I'm surprised he's gone. But in this business, I guess nothing is too surprising.”

WASHINGTON — After railing against FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, Democrats aligned with her presidential campaign reacted to his firing not with satisfaction — but with deep suspicion.

Among the former Clinton officials weighing in was her campaign manager Robby Mook. Despite frustration and disappointment over the way Comey handled the Clinton investigation, the announcement “terrifies me,” said Mook.

Twilight zone. I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled. But this terrifies me. — Robby Mook (@RobbyMook) May 9, 2017

Brian Fallon, who was a top communications official during the campaign, said he’s “not shedding any tears for Comey,” even as his firing makes him “worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now.”

I'm not shedding any tears for Comey personally -he hurt FBI's reputation- but I do worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) May 9, 2017

In a letter to Comey, Trump cited as cause for the FBI director’s firing his handling of the investigation into Clinton’s private email server, including public statements he made leading up to the presidential election. Yet Comey’s judgment over the email investigation has been an issue for several months. As recently as late January, Comey was seen patting Comey on the back during a White House reception to honor law enforcement officers.

What’s new is that Comey’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump campaign officials is heating up, including whether there is any evidence of collusion between the two as Russia sought to bolster Trump’s campaign and hurt Clinton’s, according to numerous U.S. intelligence agencies.

The firing also comes days after Comey testified before Congress about his handling of the email investigation during which he mistakenly stated that the FBI had obtained thousands of new emails from a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. While the FBI later corrected the misstatement, it appears to have given the White House an opening to fire the FBI director.

Comey came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats throughout the course of the Clinton investigation. It was days before the Nov. 8, 2016, election that Comey announced his team had found additional emails on the laptop of her aide, Huma Abedin, which the Clinton campaign blames for depressing votes in critical battlegrounds that Clinton lost to Trump by a small margin. During the hearing, Comey said he was “mildly nauseous” if his actions had any effect on the presidential election, while insisting he had no choice but to inform the public about the emails.

They also faulted Comey for speaking out about the investigation in July, when he explain why he decided against bringing charges against Clinton.

It was a break with normal FBI protocol, yet Comey may have felt pressure to speak out after former President Bill Clinton drew criticism for boarding the plane and having a private conversation with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

WASHINGTON — White House officials say President Trump based his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday on the ""clear recommendations"" of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a memo released Tuesday evening, Rosenstein sharply criticized the FBI chief, saying he mishandled the final stages of investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's treatment of classified State Department emails. The firing was needed to restore public confidence in the agency, Rosenstein concluded.

At the heart of the criticism: Comey's various public pronouncements about the investigation during the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. On July 5, Comey held a news conference in which he said no charges would be filed against Clinton. But on Oct 28, Comey announced that the probe had been reopened to examine newly discovered emails. Then, two days before before election, Comey once again weighed in, saying the department still was not recommending charges against the former secretary of State.

Here are key points in Rosenstein's memo:

1. ""The FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice. That is deeply troubling to many department employees and veterans, legislators and citizens.""

2. ""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unifies people of diverse perspectives.""

3. ""The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors.""

4. ""Compounding the error: The director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

5. ""Although the president has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former department officials. The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong.""

The surprise is it took so long.

Is anyone surprised that President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey? Well, yes – some are surprised he did it, and others are surprised it took so long.

How the mighty have fallen. In March, Comey was hailed as “the most powerful person in Washington.” But those who are tagged “most powerful” have a funny way of quickly being shown up, particularly when they serve at the pleasure of the president. In Comey’s case, his power supposedly was based on his ongoing investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 presidential election, an investigation which has turned up nothing of great importance, certainly nothing to substantiate charges of Russia “hacking the election.”

In fact, Comey had been a dead man walking for some time. He was a director without a constituency. He had tried to strike a balance in a sharply divided political environment and wound up alienating both sides. He had to go.

Democrats blame him for Hillary Clinton’s election loss. Just last week Hillary Clinton said if the election were held October 27 she would be the president – that is, the day before Comey’s dramatic note to Congress that he had reopened the FBI’s investigation into her alleged mishandling of classified information through her bootleg email server.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Then two days before the election Comey said “never mind.” The Bureau had hastily reviewed the 49,000 potentially relevant emails it had found on a laptop owned by disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner, and nothing there changed its conclusions from the previous July when he had called out Mrs. Clinton for lying but did not recommend prosecution.

Whether this rollercoaster ride had an impact on the election is one question, but Comey’s seemingly erratic behavior so close to an election was quite another. I was at a meeting with some senior members of the law enforcement community when Comey backed off the investigation and they expressed utter bewilderment at what he was doing. It went beyond how this would affect Comey’s career or his reputation; he was potentially tarnishing the Bureau itself. And for all this Comey said he had no regrets.

Republicans have never bought into the story line that Comey cost Clinton the election. And they fault him for not recommending criminal prosecution of Mrs. Clinton for her alleged misdeeds. But their main complaint was that he gave the Russia story more weight than it deserved. In March, Comey revealed that there had been an active counterintelligence investigation on “the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.”

This was an unprecedented admission, and may have been an attempt on Comey’s part to make it politically difficult to fire him. Clearly, not difficult enough. And while Comey said he had “no information that supports” the idea that President Trump had been “wiretapped,” the full nature of the surveillance Trump’s campaign and administration have been subjected to has yet to be revealed.

The bottom line was that Comey repeatedly made himself the issue. His mandate was to enforce the law fairly and impartially. Instead he appeared time and again to be gaming the system. A March poll showed that only 17% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Comey. In President Trump’s letter firing Comey he said that the FBI needed new leadership “that restores public trust and confidence in its law enforcement mission.” Fortunately, Comey’s poor approval did not rub off on the FBI itself. A February 2017 poll showed public trust in the Bureau at 80%, making it one of the most trusted institutions in the country. With James Comey gone now the FBI can find a director more worthy of the title.

WASHINGTON — President Trump stunned the political world by firing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, an abrupt ending to a tenure marked by political controversies ranging from Trump's connections to Russia to Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails.

Trump says he based his decision on the recommendations from both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a written statement, Trump said that ""the FBI is one of our nation’s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement."" The search for a new permanent FBI director will begin immediately, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.

Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" in a letter released by the White House.

In recommending Comey's firing, the Justice Department leadership excoriated the FBI director for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. In his termination letter, Trump agreed Comey was ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

Comey's sudden dismissal calls into question the future of the investigation into Russian hacking of the 2016 presidential election.

The FBI is currently in the midst of a full-blown counterintelligence inquiry, exploring charges of possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

Trump even referred to the FBI's ongoing investigation in his termination letter — telling Comey he appreciated him ""informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

Yet Democrats — including some who had previously attacked Comey for his handling of the Clinton probe — saw Trump's move as a blatant attempt to short-circuit the Russia investigation.

""This is nothing less than Nixonian,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a reference to President Richard Nixon's decision in 1973 to remove the Watergate special prosecutor.

And Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's decision to fire the man overseeing a federal investigation into his campaign associates' collusion with Russia ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter.""

Schiff, whose panel is conducting a separate investigation into Russia's influence on the presidential election, called for an independent prosecutor ""to restore a modicum of public confidence — now completely lacking — that the criminal investigation will continue without further interference by the White House.""

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., who is leading a Senate panel’s investigation into Russia’s election interference, said he was “troubled’’ by both the timing and reasons for Comey’s dismissal.

""I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the committee,’’ Burr said. “In my interactions with the director and with the bureau under his leadership, he and the FBI have always been straightforward with our committee.

“Director Comey has been more forthcoming with information than any FBI director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intelligence committees,"" he continued. ""His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.”

A career prosecutor, Comey, held top Justice Department posts in the George W. Bush administration before being appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

He is only the second director fired in the 82-year history of the FBI. President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions in 1993 amid ethics problems. While FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms in order to make them nominally non-partisan, they can still be fired by the president.

As news of Comey's dismissal raced through Washington on Tuesday night, Republicans defended the move as difficult but necessary.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Comey's ""decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts.""

Meanwhile, Comey was apparently finding out his own employment status in an unconventional way.

Comey left Washington earlier Tuesday for a speaking engagement, and was not informed of his firing until he saw news reports of it on television while at the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, a person familiar with the matter said.

The abrupt firing came just after the FBI confirmed Comey provided erroneous testimony to a Senate panel about how Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin handled classified emails.

Notably, some of the same Democrats upset about Comey's firing have also previously called for his head, blaming Clinton's loss of the presidency on Comey's unexpected public announcement on Oct. 28 that he was re-opening the investigation into her emails.

Rosenstein, confirmed by the Senate two weeks ago as Comey's day-to-day supervisor, also faulted Comey for announcing he had re-opened the case 11 days before the election — and for his earlier July 5 news conference saying no charges would be filed against Clinton.

In a memo to the attorney general, Rosenstein said he did not understand Comey's refusal to acknowledge fault with his actions.

""Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of different perspectives,"" Rosenstein wrote.

How did we get here? A James Comey timeline

Tweets fly fast and furious following firing of FBI head Comey

James Comey is one of several officials President Trump fired

Meanwhile, as Comey remains the target of public criticism over his handling of the Clinton case, the Justice Department’s inspector general is in the midst of wide-ranging review of Justice’s handling of the matter, including Comey’s leadership of it.

Last week, Comey disclosed in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had been interviewed by Justice investigators assigned to the case and expected to be questioned again.

“I have a story to tell,’’ Comey told the panel.

Comey, 56, succeeded Robert Mueller, the longest serving FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover. Mueller served for 12 years before leaving the bureau.

A former chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan and former deputy attorney general, Comey won plaudits for his independence as a key player in one of the most dramatic moments during the George W. Bush administration.

With then-Attorney General John Ashcroft hospitalized in 2004 with acute pancreatitis, Deputy Attorney General Comey rushed to his boss’ bedside at George Washington Hospital when he learned that then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House chief of staff Andrew Card were trying to persuade Ashcroft to reauthorize a controversial warrantless eavesdropping program.

Since taking office, Comey has staked out the highest profile of any director since Hoover.

In any venue, the 6-foot-8-inch Comey is hard to miss. Often referring to himself as an “awkward white guy,’’ he was anything but while delivering testimony before Congress engaging audiences in public and private forums.

Even in high-stakes congressional hearings, Comey often operated without written text and rarely sought advice from aides who accompanied him.

His public and controversial handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation was only the latest in a string of public positions that the director took that did not always sit well with the White House and the Justice Department — including under Obama's administration.

He bluntly acknowledged law enforcement’s fraught relationship with the racial and ethnic communities in addresses at Georgetown University and in Birmingham, Ala., and has suggested that less-aggressive policing may be contributing to spikes in violent crime in some parts of the country—a position that put him at odds with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Obama White House.

He drew the wrath of the tech industry and privacy advocates last year as the face of the government’s legal battle with Apple Inc., to gain access to the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook. With Apple insisting that creating a way to break into the device's default encryption would be tantamount to giving the FBI a ""backdoor"" that could be used to break into Apple products again and again, Comey described the dispute as the “hardest problem I’ve encountered in my entire government career.’’

At another point, Comey acknowledged the vexing nature of battling homegrown violent extremists, ticking off a list of recent bloody assaults and attempted attacks that have scarred communities across the country, from Garland, Texas to Orlando, Fla. His public concern about the FBI's capacity to confront the growing homegrown threat, prompted lawmakers to question whether the bureau had the resources to deal with it.

As the White House searches for a replacement, FBI Agents Association President Thomas O’Connor called on the Trump administration to proceed with “caution.""

“A change in FBI leadership of this magnitude must be handled carefully and with an eye towards ensuring that the bureau can continue to fulfill its responsibility to protect the American public from criminal and national security threats,’’ O’Connor said.

“We greatly appreciate Director Comey’s service, leadership, and support for special agents during his tenure. He understood the centrality of the agent to the bureau's mission, recognizing that agents put their lives on the line every day. His focus was to ensure that the bureau’s investigations complied with the law and the constitution, and that agents performed their mission with integrity and professionalism. As vital stakeholders, FBI agents should be given a voice in the process of selecting the next director.”

6,James Comey is one of several officials President Trump fired,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump fired the Director of the FBI. Veuer's Nick Cardona (@nickcardona93) has that story. Buzz60

James Comey, the now former FBI director, became on Tuesday the latest to join the growing list of officials President Trump has fired in the early days of his presidency.

Here's a reminder of who else is in the club, in order of their dismissals:

Sally Yates

Trump's former acting attorney general was a holdover from the Obama administration. Just days into Trump's presidency, Yates was dismissed on January 30 after she refused to defend the first iteration of his travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

""Ms. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,"" a statement from the White House said.

Mike Flynn

The former national security adviser was mired in controversy in February after news reports surfaced that he had misled officials, including then-Vice President-elect Pence, about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn resigned on February 13, less than a week later.

""Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice-president elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador,"" Flynn wrote in a public statement. ""I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.""

Preet Bharara

The former U.S. attorney was another holdover from the Obama administration. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had asked for the resignations of 46 federal prosecutors. Bharara refused, asserting that he had met privately with Trump after the 2016 election and the incoming president had asked him to stay. He then announced he was fired by Trump on March 11.

On Twitter, Bharara said: ""I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired. Being the US Attorney in SDNY (Southern District of New York) will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.""

Angella Reid

The former chief usher at the White House was unceremoniously fired last week. Reid joined the White House in 2011 under then-President Obama. While Trump officials said it isn't uncommon for staffs to transition between administrations, it is unusual for a chief usher to be dismissed. They typical hold their positions for several years and over a number of administrations. It remains unclear why Reid was let go on May 5.

James Comey

For months, the FBI director has been in the headlines for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her days as secretary of State and, later, for his agency's probe into possible connections between the Trump administration and Russia. His firing was announced on Tuesday, within hours of the FBI sending a letter to Congress that stated Comey had given inaccurate testimony about a Clinton aide forwarding ""hundreds and thousands of emails.""

16,What's up with Melania Trump's cyber bullying campaign? It's 'a work in progress',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In a rare campaign speech, Melania Trump said that one of her key issues as First Lady would be to combat cyber bullying Time

Melania Trump, America's historic first lady, pledged before the election that she would lead a campaign against cyber bullying.

But so far, say leaders and activists in anti-cyber bullying efforts, neither Trump nor her East Wing staff have reached out, nor have they responded to offers to help.

""I'm not seeing any movement towards an initiative that she's endorsed,"" says first lady historian Myra Gutin of Rider University in New Jersey. ""She's hired some staff but not up to the level that other first ladies have done by now.""

Trump's press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, says the anti-cyber bullying effort is still a work in progress. ""Mrs. Trump is being very thoughtful when it comes to building out her initiatives,"" Grisham said in an email. Also, her staff now numbers 10, and she's taking her time hiring because she values ""quality over quantity.""

Trump herself declined to comment, as she has routinely since she became first lady. But on Nov. 3, 2016, she attracted widespread attention when she announced in a rare speech that she would fight cyber bullying as her first-lady cause if her husband, Donald Trump, were elected.

“Technology has changed our universe. But like anything that is powerful it can have a bad side,"" she told an audience of suburban women in Berwyn, Pa. ""Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and to teenagers.”

Her declaration brought out plenty of ire on social media from those who consider Donald Trump the definition of a cyber bully given his aggressive social media attacks against anyone who piques his fury.

Lady Gaga, whose Born This Way Foundation aims to combat bullying, especially of LGBT kids, was scathing, though Gaga's representative did not return a message from USA TODAY seeking comment on how she feels about Melania Trump now.

.@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for ""anti-bullying"" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed. — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) November 6, 2016

But there was no mocking from other anti-cyber bullying activists, who say they remain patient and hopeful that Trump will launch her initiative soon.

""We have tried to reach out to her and offer the services and expertise of our organization; so far, we have not heard back,"" says Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, founder of the Institute of Digital Media and Child Development in New York. Still, ""I’m delighted that Melania Trump chose cyber bullying. I think she could do a tremendous amount for the children and adolescents who are suffering as a result of it.""

Since the election, excited activists have been sending Trump advice and proposals, such as holding an annual online safety summit at the White House, says Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.

""We haven’t heard anything from FLOTUS at all (so) I’m not in a position to speak to what she is or is not doing since we’re not connected yet,"" says Hinduja.

He says ""everyone in my line of work has been buzzing"" since Trump's speech. He says ""good progress"" has been made on cyber bullying over the last eight years by the White House, the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education.

""And we’re just hoping that there will be continued and even increased support and contributions from the highest office in the land,"" he says. ""That is tremendously exciting for all of us.""

The Family Online Safety Institute welcomed Trump to the cause in December, issuing a set of recommendations such as: Inaugurating an annual Online Safety Summit at the White House; creating a chief online safety officer; and persuading the new administration to set up a $25 million research-and-education fund over five years to create educational programs for children and their parents on cyber bullying and online safety in general.

""We are still waiting to hear from her or her office about how she wishes to take this topic on,"" says Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Washington-based group. ""The only indication we’ve had is that speech before the election. And then, of course, she has mostly remained in New York. So there's not been a great deal of movement yet.

""But of those I've spoken to, including in my own organization, we’re cautiously optimistic.""

Susan Swearer, a psychology professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network, says she's not been contacted by Trump's team. ""It’s such important work and there’s a huge need for creating kinder and supportive online and offline spaces, so I hope FLOTUS decides to engage in this important work,"" she says.

Donna Rice Hughes, a key figure in a 1987 political scandal that ended a Democratic presidential campaign, has been a respected leader on Internet safety for kids for more than two decades through her Enough is Enough non-profit. She endorsed Donald Trump and though she hasn't heard yet from Melania, she is convinced it will happen and that mothers especially will relate to the new FLOTUS.

""She is modeling what it means to have a balanced life and the difficulty most women who have families are having in trying to keep that all in balance,"" says Hughes. ""I am not at all concerned or surprised she's taking some time. It's very clear right now her priority is her son. She’s got four years minimum, maybe eight, to deal with cyber bullying.""

Official Portrait of First Lady pic.twitter.com/K1DUVE5kSI — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) April 3, 2017

Could President Trump's online blasts undermine the first lady's cause? Possibly, says Balkam, but it would depend on the specifics of her initiative. If she focuses on, say, child-on-child cyber bullying, ""it's possible nothing he does undermines what she tries to do. But let’s wait and see.""

Combating digital bullying is not a new cause nor an inconsequential one, according to the experts and activists who have been laboring in relative obscurity for years, concerned about analysis (from the Cyberbullying Research Center in Orlando, for instance) showing that two-thirds of students who experience cyber bullying say it affected their ability to learn and feel safe at school.

Monica Lewinsky has been a recent high-profile voice on the issue: She called for an end to the ""culture of humiliation"" in a powerful TED talk in 2015. ""Cruelty is nothing new. But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible,"" she said then. ""Millions of people can stab you with their words and that's a lot of pain.""

She would seem to be a perfect ally to Melania Trump — and in fact, she defended the Trumps' young son, Barron, after he was mocked online — but her spokeswoman, Dini von Mueffling, confirmed to USA TODAY that so far Lewinsky has not heard from Trump.

all children need to be protected from bullying + mockery. (incl #barrontrump). let's be better than this. https://t.co/CH3IfdpQpu — Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) January 23, 2017

But nothing beats a first lady's spotlight for focusing attention. So far, Trump has said nothing about cyber bullying in public, except on April 26, when she celebrated her 47th birthday at a lunch for Senate spouses at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

Grisham confirmed Trump mentioned cyber bullying at the lunch, thanking the group for a donation they made in her name to an anti-bullying organization, which is the tradition of the Senate spouses group for every incoming new first lady. But the lunch was closed to the media at the behest of the group so there's no official transcript.

Soon after the election, Donald Trump said his third wife would not move into the White House immediately after the inauguration; instead, she would remain in New York so that Barron, 11, could finish the school year.

Grisham maintains she's still been ""100% present"" as first lady since Jan. 20, and anyway nowadays people can work remotely from anywhere.

For comparison, Michelle Obama also said her first priority would be her children when she became first lady in 2009, though she immediately was visible and active. She did not fully launch her first initiative, her campaign for healthy eating and against childhood obesity, until nine months after she came to the White House.

""With Mrs. Trump, who's not living here yet and who's just starting to assemble her team, it may take a little longer to roll out her first initiative, but it will be done with a level of full knowledge, research and careful attention to the important data out there on this issue,"" predicts Anita McBride, who worked in multiple administrations, was former first lady Laura Bush's chief of staff and now studies the legacies of first ladies at American University in Washington.

But her absence has been noticed: Stylish and statuesque, the ex-model stands out when she is present, stimulating further curiosity about her. But she remains largely inscrutable; unlike her polished stepdaughter, businesswoman-turned-White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, Melania has not done media interviews about her plans.

Does it matter that Trump has been a slow-starting FLOTUS?

Every new first lady takes a different approach, says McBride, and it's nothing to worry about. ""We may have to get used to, with this new first lady, she's not going to do it the way her predecessors did it; she's going to do it the way it fits her best. That may be more limited but it will be just as impactful.""

First-lady expert Kate Andersen

Brower,

author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies,

says she's sympathetic to the notion that Trump needs more time to understand the job. ""While they get a honeymoon period, I think that's quickly coming to an end,"" Andersen Brower says.

Gutin suspects most people don't care, but she thinks Trump is missing an opportunity.

""The tradition is that the presidential spouse gives us some insight into the character of the president, and certainly since Jacqueline Kennedy those of us who care about it have always thought the first lady can use (the White House audience) to do a lot of good,"" Gutin says. ""Does it matter to the success of an administration? Probably not. But there is the opportunity there and she's not taking advantage of it.""

Or not yet, anyway.

Netflix's 13 Reasons Why has yet another reason for getting noticed.

The series, which controversially centers on the suicide of a teenager, has been renewed for a second season.

Their story isn't over. Season 2 of #13ReasonsWhy is coming. pic.twitter.com/nY5vTUfXdo — 13 Reasons Why (@13ReasonsWhy) May 7, 2017

The story is about Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), who has left behind cassette tapes explaining 13 reasons why she took her life.

But all of the tapes were played in Season 1. So what's in store for Season 2? Netflix tweeted out an interview with executive producer Brian Yorkey that reveals a few details about the new episodes, which are expected to hit the streaming service in 2018.

What we know about @13ReasonsWhy season 2 — so far pic.twitter.com/PMUaIe6Zy8 — Netflix US (@netflix) May 9, 2017

We know that the new season will likely start a few months after the first season's finale, will get a new narrator (though Hannah will still appear on the show) and instead of tapes, will use ""a different sort of analog technology,"" Yorkey says.

Here are a few of the questions that Season 2 will answer, according to Yorkey: ""Is Tyler going to do something? What’s going to happen to Alex? Will Bryce be brought to justice?""

Season 1 had 13 episodes and was executive produced by Selena Gomez, who teased last week that ""maybe"" there would be another season of the series.

She also told the Associated Press that she was proud of the project.

""We stayed very true to the book,"" Gomez said. ""What Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do. We wanted to do it justice and, yeah, (the backlash is) going to come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing.""

Psychologists, educators and parents have widely criticized13 Reasons' potential to be interpreted as glamorizing suicide, prompted Netflix to add warnings to episodes.

9,'Embarrassed' Matt Harvey apologizes to Mets for skipping game,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey apologized for his behavior that led to a three-game suspension without pay for violating team rules. Time_Sports

NEW YORK — Matt Harvey showed up Tuesday afternoon at Citi Field, rejoining the Mets for the first time since his three-game suspension for missing Saturday's game. It put the spotlight on the pitcher again after a tumultuous long weekend away.

Harvey admitted he had stayed out late Friday night and then played golf Saturday morning, which all led to him not coming to the ballpark that afternoon. Harvey apologized to the Mets Tuesday then came out for a public mea culpa.

“I'm extremely embarrassed for my actions,” Harvey said. “I’m looking forward to getting things back on track and doing everything to help this team win.”

Harvey has the right to file a grievance through the players union against the suspension, but did not say whether he would or not, saying it was no on his mind at this point.

Matt Harvey's opening statement and apology pic.twitter.com/bGIaceckpi — SportsNet New York (@SNYtv) May 9, 2017

It was not the first time Harvey has had to explain and apologize for his tardiness. He arrived late for a workout prior to the 2015 postseason and professed he wouldn't do that again. Tuesday, he sat in the same place and offered his contrition for doing it again.

“I think people make mistakes,” he said. “I made another mistake.”

The incident and the suspension were the latest rough patch for Harvey this year. He has a 5.14 ERA this season after missing the second half of last season. Now comes another blight on his record.

“I understand that every way you can look at this situation it's completely my fault,” Harvey said. “There's only one thing I can do and that's apologize and sincerely mean that.”

He added: “It's obviously hasn't been an ideal three days for me or for anybody and the last thing I ever want to do again is put me or this team in this type of situation.”

The Mets, at least in the moment, have been accepting of Harvey’s apology and his return. His teammates said they are welcoming him back with open arms. Bartolo Colon, now with the Braves, texted Harvey. But manager Terry Collins says it will be incumbent on Harvey to prove himself.

“I told him he needs to make baseball No. 1,” Collins said. “When he did that he was on top of the world.”

Last week the UFC announced and then retracted plans to launch a women’s flyweight division with season 26 on “The Ultimate Fighter” with filming expected to start in July.

Now the UFC has finally rolled out the plan — again — to kick off the 125-pound women’s division with the new season of the reality show where fighters from outside the UFC as well as competitors currently on the roster can try out for the season that will crown the first ever champion.

Tryouts will be held on May 23 at the Palace Station Hotel in Las Vegas. Fighters are required to be between the ages of 21-34 with at least three fights and a winning professional record.

The stutter step for the announcement didn’t slow down the excitement for several fighters already competing in the UFC, who have already expressed interest in moving to flyweight once the division opens.

Jessica Eye, who was previously ranked as the No. 1 fighter in the world at flyweight, has already told FOX Sports that if she wins her next bout on July 7 against Aspen Ladd that she plans to move down to 125 pounds.

Former “Ultimate Fighter” competitor Bec Rawlings has also mentioned a potential move to flyweight although it doesn’t appear she’s interested in competing during another season of the reality show after already doing that once previously in her career.

Lauren Murphy has stated that she plans on gunning for a spot on the reality show with an aim to become the first ever women’s flyweight champion in the UFC.

9,Exclusive: 'Range of emotions' for Brad Keselowski after Team Penske final appeal denied | FOX Sports,"On Tuesday, Team Penske failed in their final appeal to the National Motorsports Appeals Panel of penalties suffered after Brad Keselowski’s No. 2 Ford was found to have too much skew in the rear suspension in post-race inspection at Phoenix Raceway in March.

As a result, Keselowski will lose crew chief Paul Wolfe for this weekend’s race at Kansas Speedway – the final race of his three-race suspension. Wolfe was also fined $65,000 for the violation. After finishing fifth in the race, Keselowski and the No. 2 team were also docked 35 points.

Keselowski still remains third in standings despite the points loss, seven points behind Martin Truex Jr. and 14 points ahead of Chase Elliott.

Before making an appearance on Tuesday’s edition of NASCAR Race Hub at 6 p.m. ET on FS1, Keselowski spoke with FOXSports.com about the news.

“It’s not anything that we didn’t expect,” said Keselowski. “The penalty was already there. I would say there is a range of emotions, which go from being glad it’s over to frustration. It is what it is.”

Team Penske XFINITY Series crew chief Brian Wilson will serve as Keselowski’s interim crew chief once again for Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 (7 p.m. ET, FS1). Wilson also filled in during the first two races of Wolfe’s suspension at Auto Club Speedway (March 27) and Talladega Superspeedway (May 7).

Despite the outcome, Keselowski didn’t completely place the blame on NASCAR regarding the situation as a whole.

“We felt like both sides were a little bit wrong between NASCAR and the team,” Keselowski said. “There was a process with an appeals board to really get a third-party in. I thought it was maybe worthy of some type of a compromise to back the penalty down at the very least, if not complete rescind it. That didn’t happen.”

In the first appeal on April 12, a three-member board decided that NASCAR’s penalty was warranted. The final appeal by Team Penske that was originally scheduled for April 26 until appeals officer Bryan Moss fell ill and was ultimately replaced by television executive Roger Werner.

Overall, with two wins on the year at Atlanta and Martinsville, Keselowski was hoping for a different outcome but also ready to move forward.

“A little disappointed and frustrated by that, but also respectful of the entire process,” Keselowski said.

Team Penske also released a statement following the final appeal decision:

“We are disappointed in the outcome of today’s final appeal hearing. While we appreciate the process that NASCAR and the National Motorsports Appeals Panel has put in place to resolve issues like this, we felt like the penalties received following the March event at Phoenix were unjust. Brian Wilson will once again serve as Brad Keselowski’s crew chief this weekend at Kansas Speedway. We’re happy to finally have this behind us as the No. 2 team focuses its efforts on another Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Championship.”

9,Stone Cold Steve Austin explains why he won't make a full-time comeback to WWE | FOX Sports,"WWE fans love nothing more than seeing legendary figures return to the ring after long absences, but arguably the most popular superstar in the history of professional wrestling has no desire to make a full-time comeback. Stone Cold Steve Austin was the latest guest on longtime ring announcer Lilian Garcia’s podcast, and he opened up about his strong disdain for the grueling travel schedules that WWE stars are required to keep.

“I don’t like to travel anymore Lilian. It’s like when I was still in the WWE and my days before that because I give or take have been in the business thirteen or fourteen years until my neck crapped out and I got out of the business, I loved being on the road back in the day.

You know you’re a road warrior, you’re addicted to the road, then all of a sudden you’re out there and you’ve been on the road for ten, fourteen whatever more days and you’re thinking ‘God dang man I really want to go home,’ and then you get home and you’re there for about a day and a half your like ‘man I’m ready to get back on the road.’ So I mean its in your blood.

But once you get out of the business – and it took me three years to get over getting out of the business, and I won’t tell that story because I told that story so many times. But my point is, you know when you’re in the business of being on the road with the WWE, you’re a road warrior and that’s what you do. That’s your life, and you love it. And I’m very passionate about the business, it’s what I wanted to do with my life, it’s the only thing I wanted to do. I didn’t want to come out here and get into acting, I did it because I had to get out of the business of pro wrestling… When you turn back into what I call ‘civilian mode,’ you know, you kind of lose all that interest in traveling.”",fox-sports
9,Watch Dani Alves' perfect first-time volley that all but confirms Juventus' way into the Champions League final | FOX Sports,"Dani Alves has been the bane of Monaco’s existence over two legs for Juventus. He set up both of the Bianconeri’s goals in the first leg, and the Monegasques had no answer for him as the Old Lady came away from the principality with a 2-0 lead.

In the second leg, it was his perfectly lofted ball to the back post that set up Mario Mandzukic’s first goal, and then he doubled Juve’s lead on the day, making it 4-0 on aggregate with a searing first-time volley just before halftime.

Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic was busy from the start against Juve, and he made a few huge saves to keep the Old Lady off the scoresheet early, but there wasn’t much he could do against Alves for the second. He did well to get to Pjanic’s dangerous corner and punch, but his attempted clearance flew straight to Dani Alves and the rest is history.

With the goal, Alves has scored or assisted every single one of Juventus’ four goals against Monaco in the semifinals.

Not bad for a 34-year-old signed on a free transfer.

6,CNN exclusive: Grand jury subpoenas issued in FBI's Russia investigation,"Washington (CNN) Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records, as part of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year's election, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey.

The subpoenas represent the first sign of a significant escalation of activity in the FBI's broader investigation begun last July into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia.

The subpoenas issued in recent weeks by the US Attorney's Office in Alexandria, Virginia, were received by associates who worked with Flynn on contracts after he was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, according to the people familiar with the investigation.

Robert Kelner, an attorney for Flynn, declined to comment. The US Attorney's Office in Alexandria, the Justice Department and the FBI also declined to comment.

3,Australian politician becomes first to breastfeed in parliament,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Australian Senator Larissa Waters with her daughter, Alia Joy

Australian Senator Larissa Waters has become the first politician to breastfeed in the nation's parliament.

Ms Waters, from the left-wing Greens party, fed two-month-old daughter Alia Joy during a vote on Tuesday.

The lower house last year joined the Senate in allowing breastfeeding, but no MPs in either house had done so.

It followed a backlash in 2015 when Kelly O'Dwyer, a government minister, was asked to consider expressing milk to avoid missing parliamentary duties.

""We need more women and parents in Parliament,"" Ms Waters said on Facebook.

""And we need more family-friendly and flexible workplaces, and affordable child care, for everyone.""

Flexibility urged

Labor Senator Katy Gallagher said the moment deserved to be acknowledged.

""Women have been doing it in parliaments around the world,"" she told Sky News Australia.

""Women are going to continue to have babies and if they want to do their job and be at work and look after their baby... the reality is we are going to have to accommodate that.""

Until last year, MPs in the lower House of Representatives could take babies only into parliamentary offices or public galleries.

Politicians have been permitted to breastfeed in the Senate since 2003.

The subject is a sensitive issue in many parliaments around the world. In 2016, Spanish MP Carolina Bescansa, from the Podemos (We Can) party, was both criticised and commended for by taking her baby into parliament and breastfeeding him.

Last year, a report on diversity in UK politics recommended that allowing breastfeeding in the House of Commons should be considered.

However, one MP in 2015 warned it could risk ridicule from the tabloid press.",bbc-news
3,Venezuela sees sharp rise in infant and maternal mortality,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Health care workers protested in February in Caracas against President Nicolas Maduro's government, the lack of medicines and low salaries

There has been a sharp rise in infant mortality and maternal death rates in Venezuela.

In the first figures released for two years, the Health Ministry said the number of women dying in childbirth was up by 65%, while child deaths were up 30%.

There has also been a jump in illnesses such as malaria and diphtheria.

The figures reflect the country's deep economic crisis which the opposition says the government has mismanaged.

President Nicolas Maduro says the health crisis is caused by medicines being hoarded to encourage a coup against him.

The country has the largest oil reserves in the world but the collapse of oil prices a few years ago led to a recession and a shortage of the foreign currency needed to import equipment, food and medicines.

Venezuelans face shortages of everything from food to vaccines.

Sorry state of hospitals

UN to supply medicines?

In a recent survey, three-quarters of Venezuelans say their health has plummeted, and that they are eating less than two meals a day. Many report losing an average of around 9 kilos (19 pounds).

In the health sector, large numbers of doctors have emigrated. A leading pharmaceutical association has said around 85% of medicines are in short supply.

Speaking to the Reuters news agency, a critic of the government's health policies, Dr Julio Castro, an infectious disease specialist said:

""The striking part is the turmoil in almost all categories that this bulletin addresses, with particularly significant increased in the infant and maternal health categories.""

Many Venezuelans have trekked to the border with Brazil or Colombia to buy medicine there and seek treatment in public hospitals in neighbouring countries.

In Brazil, the state of Roraima declared a state of emergency to deal with thousands of Venezuelans seeking treatment by the public health service in small border towns.

It is not clear why Venezuela's Health Ministry published its figures now. It had stopped releasing figures after July 2015.

The country has been paralysed for over a month by almost-daily increasingly violent demonstrations against the government of Nicolas Maduro with protestors calling for elections.",bbc-news
6,Analysis: James Comey's firing won't end election controversy over Russia,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The White House reports Comey's dismissal comes after he was found in the middle of several political controversies like Russia's possible election interference and Hillary Clinton's handling of classified e-mails. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Just last week, President Trump was on Twitter accusing FBI Director James Comey of being too soft on his election opponent, Hillary Clinton.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!"" Trump tweeted May 2.

A week later, Trump sacked Comey — but for the exact opposite reason. Moments after announcing Comey's firing, the White House released a Justice Department letter that claimed Comey had inappropriately disparaged Clinton during the election campaign — and overstepped his bounds in publicly disclosing that he had reopened his investigation into the former secretary of State's emails.

Only Trump knows the real reason for Comey's firing.

But in his letter to Comey informing him of his dismissal, Trump issued what appeared a Shakespearean protestation: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump wrote to Comey on Tuesday.

Indeed, Comey was leading what appeared to be an open-ended investigation into Russian interference in the election — and what Trump associates knew about it. ""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?"" Trump tweeted Monday.

But Comey's firing will have the immediate effect of intensifying calls for an independent investigation to probe that very question.

After all, Comey was thrust into the role of refereeing the 2016 election because political appointees in the Obama and Trump administrations had been seen as incapable of doing so.

Former attorney general Loretta Lynch was forced to recuse herself from the Clinton probe after an ill-considered meeting with former president Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix in the midst of the investigation into his wife's emails.

Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama holdover, was fired 10 days into the Trump administration — four days after she warned the White House that Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was susceptible to Russian blackmail.

And Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, also had to recuse himself after misleading Congress about his own contacts with the Russian government while he served as a high-profile supporter of Trump's campaign.

So the political maelstrom Comey found himself in wasn't entirely of his own making. Still, Comey did not shun the spotlight that came with those politically sensitive investigations, holding unusually expository press conferences and giving freewheeling congressional testimony.

If there were any doubt that Comey was a pivotal figure in the 2016 presidential election, his firing as FBI director Tuesday should settle the issue for the history books.

It's a history that is still being written.

USA TODAY

James Comey is only the second director in the FBI's storied history to be fired.

In the year leading up to his President Trump's abrupt firing on Tuesday, he was at the center of two controversial investigations: the probe into Hillary Clinton's emails, and the ongoing investigation into whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russia during the election.

So how did we get here? Let's take a look back at the key moments of leading up to Comey's recent FBI controversies.

June 2013

President Obama appointed Comey as the seventh director of the FBI. His career included time in the private sector as well as a tenure as deputy attorney general under President George. W. Bush. Succeeding former FBI Director Robert Mueller, Comey was confirmed by the Senate for a full 10-year-term.

""I must be out of my mind to be following Bob Mueller,""’ he said at the time. ""I don't know if I can fill those shoes, but I know that, however I do, I will be standing truly on the shoulders of a giant.""

August 2015

With the 2016 presidential primaries in full swing, the FBI confirmed it was investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State.

July 1, 2016

President Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said she would accept the recommendations from the FBI and career prosecutors on the Clinton email case.

July 2, 2016

Clinton was interviewed by the FBI for 3.5 hours.

July 5, 2016

Comey called Clinton's server ""extremely careless,"" but gave a news conference in which he explained that Clinton would not be prosecuted.

July 6, 2016

Lynch accepted the FBI's recommendation not to charge Clinton.

July 7, 2016

Comey appeared before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and was grilled for his decision to recommend against charging Clinton.

Sept. 7, 2016

Comey wrote a memo to his employees, defending his recommendation.

Sept. 28, 2016

Appearing during a congressional oversight hearing, Comey once again defended his recommendation not to charge Clinton.

""You can call us wrong, but don’t call us weasels. We are not weasels,"" Comey said. ""Whether or not you agree with the result, this was done the way you want it to be done.""

Oct. 28, 2016

Comey announced that new emails had been discovered on the laptop of former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, who was married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and that messages may be related to the Clinton probe. His announcement came 11 days before Election Day

Nov. 6, 2016

Two days before the presidential election, Comey wrote a letter to lawmakers saying that the previous decision not to prosecute Clinton over her emails would stand.

March 20, 2017

During a public hearing with the House Intelligence Committee, Comey publicly acknowledged that the FBI is investigating whether there was collusion between members of Donald Trump's campaign and Russia.

Additionally, Comey dismissed Trump's claims that Trump was wiretapped by the Obama administration.

May 3, 2017

Comey made another trip to the Hill, defending his Oct. 28, 2016, decision to publicly announce the emails found on Weiner's laptop.

""It makes me mildly nauseous that we would have had an impact on the election,"" Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

During the hearing, Comey said ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails had ended up on Weiner's laptop because of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. He said Abedin made ""regular practice"" of forwarding emails to her husband, Weiner.

May 5, 2017

After reports surfaced that Comey had misstated Abedin's handling of the emails, the FBI confirmed Comey's erroneous testimony in a letter to lawmakers.

Hours later, the White House announced that Comey had been fired.

6,James Comey's fall,"(CNN) James Comey came to the FBI with a hero's reputation: He famously stood up to President George W. Bush's aides in a dramatic hospital-room confrontation over secret wiretapping.

He had few enemies in Washington when he took the helm of the FBI on a 93-1 Senate vote in 2013.

But by the time President Donald Trump unceremoniously dumped him late Tuesday, Comey had few clear friends left in town -- with his reputation under siege. His critics on both the left and the right attacked his handling of probes into Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump's Russia ties , and more.

The sudden firing threw into doubt the independence of the FBI's ongoing Russia investigation and the stability of the bureau itself, which has been wracked by charges that Comey's political meddling in the fall campaign compromised its mission.

The Justice Department inspector general has been investigating Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation and other campaign controversies since last fall, but the rapid-fire events on Tuesday added a historic level of drama to a story that has gripped Washington for months.

Not since the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" at the height of the Watergate scandal has the delicate relationship between the White House and the FBI been thrown into such turmoil.

On that night in 1973, President Richard Nixon fired a series of top Justice Department officials after they refused to fire a special prosecutor who was investigating the Watergate abuses.

Democrats, who had savaged Comey for his handling of the Clinton email investigation, reversed course and portrayed him Tuesday not as a villain, but as a victim. They quickly cast the firing in Nixonian terms and accused Trump of trying to quash the ongoing Russia investigation.

Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called the firing ""brazen interference"" in the FBI's investigation.

Even Republican Senator Richard Burr, who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed concern over Comey's firing : ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" he said in a statement.

Comey said last week at a Senate hearing that he was pained and ""mildly nauseous"" over the thought that his actions might have affected the presidential election.

But he said he had no regrets, and he had shown no indication he thought his job was in jeopardy. He has even ticked off the exact number of days he had left until his 10-year term expired in 2023 -- a term he expected to complete.

The political attacks were a remarkable turn for the 6'8"" Comey, a towering and charismatic figure who had risen to power with seeming effortlessness earlier in his career.

As a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va. in the 1990s, Comey earned high marks for a novel program that saw long prison terms for felons who used guns in their crimes. He was then given the coveted job of US Attorney in Manhattan -- before President Bush tapped him to become the second-ranking official for the entire Justice Department.

In that post, Comey burnished his reputation as an honest broker willing to stand up to power -- even at the risk of his own job.

In 2004, when his boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis, Comey refused to sign off on a secret eavesdropping program approved by Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks because he believed it might be illegal.

Two of Bush's aides, Alberto Gonzales and Andy Card, raced to the hospital to try to get Ashcroft's bedside signature to continue the wiretapping program.

But Comey, with sirens blazing on his security detail's car, beat them there and raced up the stairs to his boss's hospital room, where Ashcroft stood by his underling's decision.

The episode became a part of the Comey lore when it was first revealed publicly more than a year later.

As director of the FBI, Comey spoke frequently and passionately about distancing the bureau from the dictatorial days of J. Edgar Hoover's 48-year reign.

On his desk at the FBI, he kept a copy of a letter from Hoover for the wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. -- a dark reminder, Comey said, of the bureau's abusive past.

With public opinion turning on him over the Clinton email investigation, however, Comey appeared to realize that he was becoming increasingly isolated after years of stardom.

At a memorial service for a prosecutor held at a packed Justice Department auditorium just days before the November election, Comey joked sardonically in a eulogy about how unpopular he seemed to have become in the eyes of some colleagues.

His own memorial service, he suggested, would no doubt be held in a much smaller venue.",cnn
6,Firing James Comey is Donald Trump's most unpredictable and dangerous move yet,"(CNN) James Comey found out he had been fired as FBI director just like the rest of us: By watching it on television.

The move, announced late Tuesday via a letter sent from President Donald Trump to Comey, marked the most unpredictable moment of a presidency that through its first 100-plus day has been the least orthodox in memory. It also ramped up criticism of Trump's judgments -- Comey was tasked with leading the investigation into Russia's meddling into the 2016 campaign and what, if any, collusion had occurred between Trump campaign operatives and Russian intelligence officials -- and left official Washington reeling over a move considered unthinkable as recently as this week.

The explanation for the move, which emerged into the stunned silence it caused, made little logical sense. A report from deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein highlighted Comey's handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server as the main reason for his dismissal. Rosenstein accused Comey of an attempt to ""usurp"" the power of the attorney general by announcing publicly that he didn't believe any charges should be brought against Clinton in a July 5, 2016 press conference.

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein added. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

That echoes criticism launched by Democrats loyal to Clinton, who insisted that Comey's decision to offer his own unvarnished view of Clinton's conduct vis-a-vis her private email server -- he said she had been ""extremely careless"" -- went well beyond his proscribed duties.",cnn

WASHINGTON – James Comey was supposed to have at least six more years in his term as FBI director.

Now that he’s been abruptly fired by President Trump, the White House has launched a search to replace him.

Who could take his place? Neither the FBI nor Justice Department would provide any leads. But there could be some clues.

Four years ago, when then-President Barack Obama selected Comey to succeed Robert Mueller, his name came from a list of potential candidates who may now have a new chance at the office.

The most-discussed names in that pool included some of most familiar names in national law enforcement, along with a former member of Congress.

Before Comey’s selection was announced in 2013, former Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, was the favorite of the FBI Agents Association, a group of 13,000 current and former agents.

""Chairman Rogers exemplifies the principles that should be possessed by the next FBI director,"" then-FBIAA President Konrad Motyka said at the time, announcing the association's support for Rogers. ""His unique and diverse experience as a veteran FBI agent and member of Congress will allow him to effectively lead the men and women of the bureau as they continue their work to protect our country from criminal and terrorist threats.""

Ken Wainstein, a former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, was another favorite.

Earlier this week, Wainstein made a public appearance, even though he stayed off to the sidelines. He served as counsel to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during a Monday appearance before a Senate subcommittee exploring Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Previously, he served as the FBI's general counsel and Mueller's chief of staff at the bureau.

At the Justice Department, Wainstein also once served as the chief federal prosecutor in D.C., and the director of the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, where he oversaw the operations of 94 federal prosecutors' offices in the U.S.

Another potential pick: John Pistole. Before his appointment as president of Anderson University in Indiana three years ago, the former deputy director of the FBI, had won notice for his steady direction of the Transportation Security Administration.

Pistole also is a close friend of Comey who attended the former TSA director's induction as Anderson University president.

Some current and former FBI agents also have pointed to Michael Mason, a former executive assistant FBI director, as a candidate for the top job.

Before leaving the bureau, Mason oversaw criminal and cyber investigations, coordinated international operations and the bureau's crisis response operations.

Two former New York officials were also linked to previous discussions about top jobs at the bureau and the Justice Department: former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

Giuliani, a high-profile surrogate for the Trump campaign, had been considered for a number of positions in the new administration, including attorney general and secretary of State. Meanwhile, Kelly is an executive at a private security firm.

As the search continues, the FBI is being headed by Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

But McCabe, who helped oversee the bureau's contentious investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, also has drawn heat.

McCabe's wife, a candidate for state office in Virginia, was the recipient of nearly $500,000 raised by an organization linked to Clinton ally and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The FBI claimed that the deputy director played no role in the campaign.

What does it say about your presidency when Richard Nixon's presidential library is mocking you?

""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian,"" the library tweeted Tuesday within a couple hours of the announcement of President Trump firing FBI Director James Comey.

FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector#notNixonianpic.twitter.com/PatArKOZlk — RichardNixonLibrary (@NixonLibrary) May 9, 2017

It's true that Nixon never fired a FBI director. That honor goes to Bill Clinton, who was the first (and up until Tuesday, the only) president to fire a FBI director. Back in 1993, Clinton fired William Sessions over ethical concerns. Sessions had refused to step down voluntarily.

Still, #Nixonian was trending Tuesday night after Comey's firing. In what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon made a controversial move when he ordered the firing Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor charged with the investigation into the Watergate scandal. That led to the resignations of his attorney general, Elliott Richardson, and his deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus.

6,Comey firing troubles top Republican lawmakers,"(CNN) Top Republicans, including the senator directing the Senate's Russia investigation, said Tuesday they were ""troubled"" by President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey , while other GOP lawmakers tried to stay out of the growing political storm.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said in a statement.

While Democrats slammed Trump's decision on Comey as ""Nixonian,"" some members of the President's own party expressed concerns and divided traditional GOP alliances.

Dir. Comey has been more forthcoming w/ information than any FBI Director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intel committees.

Arizona Sen. John McCain said he was ""disappointed"" by the incident. Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and occasionally advised the Trump campaign last year, said he also had concerns.

""Regardless of how you think Director Comey handled the unprecedented complexities of the 2016 election cycle, the timing of this firing is very troubling,"" said Sen. Bob Sasse of Nebraska in a statement.

Rep. Justin Amash, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said in a tweet that he would introduce legislation supporting the creation of an independent commission to investigate Russia's interference in the election.

Amash is one of four Republicans who have signed on to legislation that would force Trump to release his tax returns.

""While the case for removal of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions,"" Corker said in a statement. ""It is essential that ongoing investigations are fulsome and free of political interference until their completion, and it is imperative that President Trump nominate a well-respected and qualified individual to lead the bureau at this critical time.""

Other Republicans came to Trump's defense or placed the blame for Comey's firing squarely on the shoulders of the former FBI director.

""Today's announcement is likely the inevitable conclusion of Director Comey's decision last July to bypass the longstanding protocols of the Justice Department and publicly announce the reasons he had decided not to recommend an indictment of Hillary Clinton and to offer his personal views of Mrs. Clinton's actions,"" Republican Sen. Susan Collins said in a statement.

""Any suggestion that today's announcement is somehow an effort to stop the FBI's investigation of Russia's attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced,"" Collins said. ""The President did not fire the entire FBI; he fired the director.""

The decision also had two traditional Republican allies apparently at odds. While McCain said Comey is ""a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" one of his closest friends -- Sen. Lindsey Graham -- said that he disagreed.

The South Carolina Republican, who is leading one of four investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, said Tuesday he supports Trump's decision.

""Given the recent controversies surrounding the director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well,"" Graham said in a statement Tuesday. ""I encourage the President to select the most qualified professional available who will serve our nation's interests.""

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he was not commenting on the firing specifically but expected the Justice Department's investigation to continue largely unchanged.

""I would expect the FBI to continue to function along the lines that we have come to expect it to function,"" the Florida Republican told CNN.

Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican who's up for re-election next year, tweeted that he couldn't explain Trump's decision.",cnn
9,Spurs win epic Game 5 over Rockets with Kawhi Leonard on the bench in OT | FOX Sports,"The Spurs got a 110-107 overtime win over the Rockets in Tuesday’s Game 5 to take a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series. And they did it with their best player in Kawhi Leonard sidelined for the entire overtime session.

Leonard suffered what appeared to be an ankle injury earlier in the game, and tried his best to play through it. But once it became clear that he couldn’t go, Gregg Popovich made the difficult decision to bench him down the stretch. Thanks to huge plays from Danny Green and Manu Ginobili — along with some brutal offensive possessions from James Harden and the Rockets, especially in overtime — San Antonio was able to win in spite of Leonard’s absence.

Leonard had to lean on Ginobili as he walked off the court following the Spurs win. Popovich told reporters after the game San Antonio doesn’t yet know Leonard’s status moving forward.

9,Jimmie Rivera meets Thomas Almeida at FOX UFC Fight Night in New York | FOX Sports,"Two top ranked bantamweights will clash at the upcoming FOX UFC Fight Night card in New York when Jimmie Rivera meets Thomas Almeida on July 22 at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island.

The new fight was first announced via Newsday on Tuesday.

Rivera (20-1) has been flawless thus far in his UFC career with four consecutive wins including a victory over new UFC Hall of Fame inductee Urijah Faber this past September.

Rivera has been clamoring for a big fight as he continues his climb up the bantamweight rankings and now he’ll face one of the most dangerous threats the divison has to offer.

Almeida (22-1) has been one of the most thrilling fighters competing at 135 pounds since his arrival in the UFC nearly three years ago.

Most recently, Almeida dispatched Albert Morales in the second round, which marked his 17th career victory by way of knockout or TKO.

Almeida’s only setback in the UFC came to current bantamweight champion Cody Garbrandt, but now he’s ready to resume his course towards title contention as he faces a tough challenge in Rivera in July.

It will be the first time the UFC has visited the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island with more fights expected to be announced in the coming weeks for the upcoming event.",fox-sports
9,Dana White: 'There's going to be a point where I'm done' pursuing McGregor vs. Mayweather | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White committed to doing everything possible to land Conor McGregor a lucrative payday against Floyd Mayweather, but the fight is still no closer to reality.

On Saturday night after Saul “Canelo” Alvarez dished out a punishing decision in his fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., his next bout against Gennady Golovkin was announced for September 16.

That was the date originally reserved for the proposed matchup between McGregor and Mayweather, but White says he just wasn’t able to strike a deal with both sides in time so a different boxing match scooped up that Saturday on the schedule.

“The reason they got my date is because I couldn’t get my deal done on time so they got the date,” White told “The Herd” on Tuesday. “Listen, life moves on, we don’t wait for anybody. The fights are going to keep rolling. I didn’t get the deal done fast enough so I lose the date. That’s how it works.”

A date being targeted for the fight might make it appear that a deal is imminent but White says that couldn’t be further from the truth.

In fact, he says he’s no closer to closing the negotiations to put together the fight between McGregor and Mayweather and there will come a day when he is forced to give up if the two sides can’t reach an amicable agreement.

“I’m not hinting that it’s getting close at all. I knew that this thing was going to be a nightmare to get done if it can even be done. We’ll find out,” White said. “Obviously, both guys want to fight each other but what’s the deal. Can the deal be done? That’s the question.

“It’s not just Mayweather. It’s both sides of this thing are going to be hard to get done. Absolutely, there’s going to be a point where I’m done. This isn’t what I do, this isn’t my business and I’m definitely going to walk away.”

White can’t say for certain when that deadline will be reached where he’ll no longer participate in the negotiations, but he promises it could eventually happen.

As much as he wants to put the fight together for McGregor, who stands to potentially make up to nine-figures for the bout, White will eventually reach his breaking point.

“Either way, it doesn’t matter to me. I know that these two guys want to fight. I’ve said many times, I respect Conor and I’d like to do this fight for him but it’s got to be the right deal. We have to get the right deal done or it’s not going to happen,” White said. “Because at the end of the day, this isn’t what I do. The UFC is what I do and I should be focusing on that and not a boxing match.

“Obviously, a lot of people want to see it, there’s a lot of interest in it, but it’s not really what I do.”",fox-sports
6,Trump once cheered Comey for the same reason he just fired him,"(CNN) Eight days before Donald Trump won the presidency, he singled out FBI director James Comey for a special round of praise during a speech to supporters in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

""It took guts for director Comey to make the move that he made,"" Trump said of the FBI chief's decision to make public the bureau's revived probe into Hillary Clinton's private email server. ""It took a lot of guts.""

But on Tuesday night, with the FBI now investigating the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia, the White House, acting on advice from the Justice Department, fired Comey.

Their stated reason?

His handling of the Clinton email case.

""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong,"" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote in a letter explaining his reasoning.

He added, without irony, that Comey had been wrong to use his July press conference, in which he publicly cleared Clinton, to ""release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" a reference to Comey's broadly critical remarks about Clinton's behavior.

While Trump railed against the initial announcement, he openly celebrated the FBI director's letter to Congress, delivered on October 28 -- when early voting had already begun in some states -- that his investigators were examining newly discovered emails that ""appear to be pertinent"" to the server probe.

In the end, there was nothing newly pertinent to the probe. But in the meantime, Trump crowed.

""I really disagreed with him (in July), I was not his fan,"" he said in Michigan on Halloween. ""But I'll tell you what -- what he did, he brought back his reputation. He brought it back. He's got to hang tough because a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing.

""But what he did,"" Trump continued, ""was the right thing.""

Then last week, after Comey's most recent testimony, Trump tweeted the FBI director was the ""best thing"" that could have happened to Clinton because he ""gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!""

FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2017

Democrats, too, have changed their tune in the aftermath of Comey's shock firing. In particular, top Clinton campaign staffers, many of whom -- along with the candidate herself -- believe his ""October surprise"" helped deliver Trump the White House.

Twilight zone. I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled. But this terrifies me. — Robby Mook (@RobbyMook) May 9, 2017

6,Comey firing draws comparisons to Nixon,"Story highlights Richard Nixon ordered Watergate special prosecutor to be fired in 1973

Trump critics call for appointment of special prosecutor to investigate alleged dealings between Trump campaign and Russia

(CNN) The ""Saturday Night Massacre"" was one of the most dramatic turns of events in the Watergate scandal -- the political drama that rocked the United States in the 1970s and led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

President Nixon and the Attorney General's office were locked in a political standoff over Nixon's refusal to comply with orders to release recordings of White House conversations.

Richard Nixon, left, and Archibald Cox, right.

Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. But Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than comply with the order. Cox was eventually fired by the US solicitor general.

Critics of President Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey see similiarities between Cox's firing decades ago and Trump's action on Tuesday.

The Trump administration, critics say, is trying to undermine the FBI's investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, just as Nixon tried to stop lawmakers from learning the truth about his role in the Watergate scandal.

6,Nixon Library weighs in: Comey firing '#notNixonian',"Story highlights President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday

The announcement of Comey's firing caused shock and surprise across Washington

Washington (CNN) Many people on Tuesday began likening President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director Jim Comey to President Richard Nixon's ""Saturday Night Massacre,"" during which the former president ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

9,Kawhi Leonard clarifies his Game 6 injury status after sitting out OT in Spurs win | FOX Sports,"The San Antonio Spurs found a way to win Game 5, but they seemed to take a big blow along the way.

Kawhi Leonard suffered a lower leg injury in the second half on Tuesday when he landed on James Harden’s foot, an injury that forced the two-time Defensive Player of the Year to miss San Antonio’s final possession of regulation and the entirety of overtime.

But the Spurs got some good news after the game. Leonard, who was walking with a pronounced limp, told reporters he won’t miss Game 6 on Thursday in Houston.

""Yeah, I'm gonna be able to play."" -Kawhi Leonard (ankle) #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/ZXwGtqcQMa — NBA TV (@NBATV) May 10, 2017

LEONARD: “It’s a little sore, but I mean, my teammates did a good job of closing out that game with me not being able to go that last stretch.”

REPORTER: “Is it an ankle or knee?”

LEONARD: “Ankle.” […]

REPORTER: “Pop said you wanted to play, but it was obvious that you needed to come out. How severe of an injury is it? Do you think you’ll be able to play in Game 6?”

LEONARD: “Yeah, I’m going to be able to play.”

Leonard naturally struggled for most of the second half following the injury, finishing with 22 points on 8-for-21 shooting, along with 15 rebounds and four assists.

The Spurs got a huge boost from Manu Ginobili with Leonard on the bench, as the 15-year veteran came up with a massive block on Harden on the final possession of overtime to seal San Antonio’s win.

Another look at Manu's game-saving block! #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/Di8IihHQo0 — NBA (@NBA) May 10, 2017

The question now for the Spurs is how limited Leonard might be in a must-win Game 6 for the Rockets. Even before the Leonard injury, San Antonio reverted to its switch-heavy defense, rather than having its franchise player try to lock down Harden for most of the night.

If Leonard isn’t 100 percent on Thursday, it stands to reason the Spurs would use a similar defensive tactic, encouraging Harden to attack mismatches in isolation instead of running the typical Houston offense.

Either way, Game 6 should be a ton of fun.",fox-sports
6,James Comey's fall,"(CNN) James Comey came to the FBI with a hero's reputation: He famously stood up to President George W. Bush's aides in a dramatic hospital-room confrontation over secret wiretapping.

He had few enemies in Washington when he took the helm of the FBI on a 93-1 Senate vote in 2013.

But by the time President Donald Trump unceremoniously dumped him late Tuesday, Comey had few clear friends left in town -- with his reputation under siege. His critics on both the left and the right attacked his handling of probes into Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump's Russia ties , and more.

The sudden firing threw into doubt the independence of the FBI's ongoing Russia investigation and the stability of the bureau itself, which has been wracked by charges that Comey's political meddling in the fall campaign compromised its mission.

The Justice Department inspector general has been investigating Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation and other campaign controversies since last fall, but the rapid-fire events on Tuesday added a historic level of drama to a story that has gripped Washington for months.

Not since the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" at the height of the Watergate scandal has the delicate relationship between the White House and the FBI been thrown into such turmoil.

On that night in 1973, President Richard Nixon fired a series of top Justice Department officials after they refused to fire a special prosecutor who was investigating the Watergate abuses.

Democrats, who had savaged Comey for his handling of the Clinton email investigation, reversed course and portrayed him Tuesday not as a villain, but as a victim. They quickly cast the firing in Nixonian terms and accused Trump of trying to quash the ongoing Russia investigation.

Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called the firing ""brazen interference"" in the FBI's investigation.

Even Republican Senator Richard Burr, who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed concern over Comey's firing : ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" he said in a statement.

Comey said last week at a Senate hearing that he was pained and ""mildly nauseous"" over the thought that his actions might have affected the presidential election.

But he said he had no regrets, and he had shown no indication he thought his job was in jeopardy. He has even ticked off the exact number of days he had left until his 10-year term expired in 2023 -- a term he expected to complete.

The political attacks were a remarkable turn for the 6'8"" Comey, a towering and charismatic figure who had risen to power with seeming effortlessness earlier in his career.

As a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va. in the 1990s, Comey earned high marks for a novel program that saw long prison terms for felons who used guns in their crimes. He was then given the coveted job of US Attorney in Manhattan -- before President Bush tapped him to become the second-ranking official for the entire Justice Department.

In that post, Comey burnished his reputation as an honest broker willing to stand up to power -- even at the risk of his own job.

In 2004, when his boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis, Comey refused to sign off on a secret eavesdropping program approved by Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks because he believed it might be illegal.

Two of Bush's aides, Alberto Gonzales and Andy Card, raced to the hospital to try to get Ashcroft's bedside signature to continue the wiretapping program.

But Comey, with sirens blazing on his security detail's car, beat them there and raced up the stairs to his boss's hospital room, where Ashcroft stood by his underling's decision.

The episode became a part of the Comey lore when it was first revealed publicly more than a year later.

As director of the FBI, Comey spoke frequently and passionately about distancing the bureau from the dictatorial days of J. Edgar Hoover's 48-year reign.

On his desk at the FBI, he kept a copy of a letter from Hoover for the wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. -- a dark reminder, Comey said, of the bureau's abusive past.

With public opinion turning on him over the Clinton email investigation, however, Comey appeared to realize that he was becoming increasingly isolated after years of stardom.

At a memorial service for a prosecutor held at a packed Justice Department auditorium just days before the November election, Comey joked sardonically in a eulogy about how unpopular he seemed to have become in the eyes of some colleagues.

His own memorial service, he suggested, would no doubt be held in a much smaller venue.",cnn
6,Trump fires FBI director James Comey,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election.

The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.

The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.

In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal there would be no backlash.

What was not thought through apparently was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe.

In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was re-opening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency.

Comey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation.

The letters

In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,"" Trump told Comey in the letter. ""I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.""

At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.

JUST WATCHED Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' 01:03

Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to ""usurp the attorney general's authority"" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution.

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein argued in his memo.

""We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),"" Rosenstein said. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

Congressional reaction

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President?"" Schumer asked

And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading an Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a ""loss for the bureau and the nation.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,"" Burr said.

As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed.

""I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general is competent to lead that effort,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership.

But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would ""raise questions.""

Sen. John McCain added: ""While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.""

The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations.

'Absurd'

CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was ""absurd.""

Toobin branded the move a ""grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.""

""This is not something that is within the American political tradition,"" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.

""This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,"" Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director.

The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25.

A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.

Team Clinton reaction

Former Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation.

""I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called ""charade"" only 24 hours ago,"" said Clinton's former campaign manager Robby Mook.

""It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,"" he said.

One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Scuitto.

""I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,"" the person said.

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials say they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they are shocked by the development.

Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President.

Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin ""forwarded hundreds and thousands"" of emails to her husband's laptop.

The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the ""hundreds and thousands of emails"" that Comey said were 'forwarded"" from Abedin to her husband's email ""included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.""

The White House said it will immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions.

Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world.

In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did.

But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election, put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight.

Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being ""extremely careless"" with sensitive information.

Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the ""political"" decision.

Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had re-opened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges.

After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part.

Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: ""I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.""

After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.

He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief.

Schiller emerged from the building just short of an hour later, the manila folder gone. By then, the stunning intent of his visit to the FBI was known, and the ramifications of a sitting president firing the man investigating his campaign's ties to Russia were reverberating across Washington.

This account of the lead-up and the aftermath of Trump's decision is based on interviews with more than two dozen officials at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI and on Capitol Hill, nearly all of whom spoke anonymously to describe an extraordinarily sensitive moment for Trump and his presidency.

Backlash begins

Backlash was swift, with claims from Democrats that Trump was ridding himself of an investigator who was delving too deeply into ties between his associates and Russia. Even some Republicans, including the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said they were troubled by the development and its timing. Comparisons to Richard Nixon, who fired a special prosecutor probing the Watergate burglary, began flying.

The White House insisted the firing came amid questions about Comey's handing of a probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server. But that explanation was betrayed by Trump's letter, which didn't mention those concerns, focusing instead on the continuing inquiry into his campaign's Russia ties.

Officials in the West Wing, many of whom weren't aware Trump was planning to fire Comey, appeared caught off guard by the furor.

The collective recoil against the move prompted urgent meetings among Trump's aides to manage the fallout. Hours after telling reporters that the White House would have no additional comment beyond Trump's own words, top aides were marched to television cameras on the North Lawn to explain the decision.

One source familiar with the President's reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks. So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.

Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails.

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2017

...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2017

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!"" he wrote from the confines of his second-floor private residence at the White House. ""The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?""

Closely held decision

The idea of firing Comey was closely held within the West Wing, these officials say, where the few aides who were aware of Trump's intentions barely discussed the topic among themselves. Among those looped in: Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who began fine-tuning their rationale for removing Comey from his post shortly after learning of Trump's intentions.

On Tuesday, they had their explanation: Comey mishandled the investigation into Clinton's emails.

""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails,"" Rosenstein wrote in a letter that the White House released Tuesday. ""I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.""

By the time the memo was complete, Trump was already preparing to execute his decision. His schedule was almost entirely cleared on Monday and Tuesday except for meetings with his national security team. Nearly as soon as Comey's firing was announced, Trump was meeting in the Oval Office with Andrew McCabe, the FBI deputy director, to gauge the agency's No. 2 before elevating him to acting director following Comey's dismissal.

Meanwhile, back at FBI headquarters, news was quickly spreading that Comey was being ushered out. Instead of delivering Trump's letter to Comey in person, Schiller deposited the document at his office. Comey, in fact, wasn't at his agency's headquarters at all when Schiller arrived with the missive from the President; he was addressing agents at the FBI's Los Angeles field office when news came down that Trump had demanded his resignation.

Instead of learning from Trump's letter that he was being fired, Comey found out from television. TVs set to cable news inside the room he was speaking began airing reports of his demise midway through his speech. He made a joke about it to lighten the situation, phoned back to FBI headquarters, and received official confirmation that his tenure atop the law enforcement agency was over.

'I have no reason to believe ...'

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials speaking Tuesday said they were unaware that Trump was preparing to fire Comey, describing themselves afterward as shocked by the development.

Asked hours before announcing the decision whether Trump maintained confidence in Comey, Spicer avoided answered forthrightly.

""I have no reason to believe -- I haven't asked him,"" Spicer said. ""I have not asked the President since the last time we spoke about this.""

The decision came at an uneasy moment for the Justice Department, which has been at the center of controversy since Trump assumed office in January. Officials described tensions that have festered over the past several months between Justice Department leadership and senior staff at the FBI over the handling of the Clinton investigation and how Comey was running the agency, according to multiple officials.

Meanwhile, the White House and Sessions have pushed the FBI to pursue leaks of classified information to the media, according to one Justice Department official, urging the agency to prioritize the probe over other matters, including the investigation into Russian election meddling.

One Justice official suggested there could be more changes coming at the FBI beyond Comey's removal.

""There is a lot of cleaning house that needs to be done,"" one official said.

Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records, as part of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year's election, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before Trump fired Comey.

Shock and confusion

While a handful of top senators were given a heads-up by Trump, the overwhelming sentiment on Capitol Hill was one of shock and confusion.

In some GOP offices, there was an open question of how exactly to respond, with communications staffers reaching out to their colleagues to try and unify their initial draft statements. Without advance notice or guidance from the White House at the start, many offices were stuck in a holding pattern, according to several aides for Republican senators.

For several senators, including some on the Senate judiciary or intelligence committees that oversee the FBI, it was news alerts on their mobile phones or reporters in hallways who broke the news of Comey's removal.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, was presiding over the Senate when the news hit.

""Basically, the parliamentarian told me,"" Rubio told reporters as he walked off the Senate floor. ""I don't have any initial reaction because I don't have any information.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, never shy about expressing his views on an issue, emerged from another senator's office to tell reporters he would be withholding judgments until he had a better handle on what had just occurred.

Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a member of the intelligence committee, told reporters he was ""surprised"" by the firing, and wasn't given a heads-up by the White House.

For Senate Democrats, it was a more straightforward process. Within 20 minutes, statement after statement began rolling out of Democrats questioning Trump's motives -- and using the firing to try and spark new momentum for a special prosecutor or independent commission to look into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.

For members of the House, currently out on recess, it was a scramble by their top staffers to try and get in touch and even brief them on the news. Some lawmakers are out of the country. Others were just about to walk into town halls. Many senior staffers had already departed for the evening by the time the news broke.

6,Trump to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov Wednesday,"(CNN) President Donald Trump plans to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, according to his schedule.

The meeting will take place at 10:30 a.m. ET in the Oval Office and will be closed to press, according to the White House.

Lavrov had planned to be in Washington Wednesday to meet with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Tillerson and Lavrov are scheduled to meet earlier Wednesday to discuss Ukraine, Syria and bilateral issues, the State Department announced.

In addition to the tensions between Washington and Moscow over geopolitics, the meetings between Tillerson and Lavrov, and now between Trump and the Russian foreign minister, come against a backdrop of recriminations over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 elections and the firing of FBI director James Comey.

Comey was dismissed Tuesday , the White House announced, sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign team colluded with Russia in its alleged interference in last year's election.

6,Comey firing draws comparisons to Nixon,"Story highlights Richard Nixon ordered Watergate special prosecutor to be fired in 1973

Trump critics call for appointment of special prosecutor to investigate alleged dealings between Trump campaign and Russia

(CNN) The ""Saturday Night Massacre"" was one of the most dramatic turns of events in the Watergate scandal -- the political drama that rocked the United States in the 1970s and led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

President Nixon and the Attorney General's office were locked in a political standoff over Nixon's refusal to comply with orders to release recordings of White House conversations.

Richard Nixon, left, and Archibald Cox, right.

Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. But Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than comply with the order. Cox was eventually fired by the US solicitor general.

Critics of President Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey see similiarities between Cox's firing decades ago and Trump's action on Tuesday.

The Trump administration, critics say, is trying to undermine the FBI's investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, just as Nixon tried to stop lawmakers from learning the truth about his role in the Watergate scandal.

Washington (CNN) Many people on Tuesday began likening President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director Jim Comey to President Richard Nixon's ""Saturday Night Massacre,"" during which the former president ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

But the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum -- located in Yorba Linda, California -- doesn't agree with that comparison.

CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey.

The subpoenas represent the first sign of a significant escalation of activity in the FBI's broader investigation begun last July into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia.

The subpoenas issued in recent weeks by the US Attorney's Office in Alexandria, Virginia, were received by associates who worked with Flynn on contracts after he was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, according to the people familiar with the investigation.

6,General election 2017: Labour and Lib Dems pledge school cash,"Image copyright PA

Labour and the Lib Dems are both making multibillion pound funding pledges to tackle school cash shortages in England.

Labour says it would raise corporation tax to spend £4.8bn on keeping up with rising costs, and £335m so no schools lost out from a funding reorganisation.

The Lib Dems are promising £7bn to protect per-pupil funding levels.

The Conservatives said school spending had reached record levels and attacked the two parties' spending plans.

Headteachers have been warning about job losses caused by cash shortages, with the National Audit Office estimating schools will have to cut £3bn from budgets by 2019-20 to meet rising cost pressures.

A new funding formula will also see some schools lose money, although others will gain.

On Monday, the Institute of Fiscal Studies said protecting schools from real-terms cuts in England would mean spending the equivalent of an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner are promising a real-terms funding increase in schools and ""free lifelong education"" in colleges, including restoring the Educational Maintenance Allowance.

This would be paid for by increasing corporation tax from the current 19% to 26% by 2021, Labour said.

""We will invest in schools and in our young people, ensuring no primary pupils go hungry during the day, reducing class sizes so children can learn and teachers can teach, and restoring the maintenance allowance and grants for students in both further and higher education,"" Ms Rayner said.

The Lib Dems claimed their plans went further than Labour's and said details of how they would funded would be provided ""in due course"" in the party's manifesto.

The party said it would also protect further education per-pupil funding in real terms.

'Made-up promises'

Lib Dem education spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: ""While funding per pupil is set to see the biggest cuts in a generation, billions of pounds are being spent on divisive plans to expand grammars and free schools.

""This extra £7bn of funding would ensure no school and no child loses out.""

The Conservatives said Labour had already committed the corporation tax rise to other projects.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said Labour's announcement was ""just made-up promises on the back of nonsensical spending plans"".

He added: ""The Lib Dems are no better and won't even tell people about the tax rises they would bring in.""

BBC education editor Branwen Jeffreys says schools in England have been experiencing a financial squeeze for the first time in 20 years, and plans for the different funding formula have galvanised lobbying by headteachers and parents.

As education is a devolved matter, the pledges relate to England only, and the amount Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receives would be determined by the funding formula.",bbc-news
6,Conservative election expenses charging decision due,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The way the Conservatives' ""battle bus"" spending was recorded is being investigated

Prosecutors are expected to announce on Wednesday whether Conservative politicians or officials will face charges for breaches of expenses rules.

The CPS is considering files sent by police following investigations in up to 27 constituencies.

It relates to claims some campaigning costs in the 2015 general election were wrongly recorded.

The Conservative Party has insisted administrative errors were to blame rather than any intention to deceive.

And it has said some of the spending was correctly declared.

Complex rules

It is alleged the Conservatives spent tens of thousands of pounds on local campaigns - including on ""battle bus"" visits by activists - which were either not declared or were wrongly registered as national spending.

The allegations came to light following an investigation by Channel 4 News.

Under complex election spending rules, parties must disclose national spending separately from money used to promote each candidate, and separate national and local limits apply.

Up to 16 police forces across England have submitted files to be considered by prosecutors.

The CPS will consider whether there is sufficient evidence of a breach in the law, and whether a prosecution is ""in the public interest"".

If general election candidates are prosecuted the Conservative Party will have to decide whether to suspend them and replace them as nominees.

The last date for candidates to register for the election is 11 May.

3,Australian politician becomes first to breastfeed in parliament,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Australian Senator Larissa Waters with her daughter, Alia Joy

Australian Senator Larissa Waters has become the first politician to breastfeed in the nation's parliament.

Ms Waters, from the left-wing Greens party, fed two-month-old daughter Alia Joy during a vote on Tuesday.

The lower house last year joined the Senate in allowing breastfeeding, but no MPs in either house had done so.

It followed a backlash in 2015 when Kelly O'Dwyer, a government minister, was asked to consider expressing milk to avoid missing parliamentary duties.

""We need more women and parents in Parliament,"" Ms Waters said on Facebook.

""And we need more family-friendly and flexible workplaces, and affordable child care, for everyone.""

Flexibility urged

Labor Senator Katy Gallagher said the moment deserved to be acknowledged.

""Women have been doing it in parliaments around the world,"" she told Sky News Australia.

""Women are going to continue to have babies and if they want to do their job and be at work and look after their baby... the reality is we are going to have to accommodate that.""

Until last year, MPs in the lower House of Representatives could take babies only into parliamentary offices or public galleries.

Politicians have been permitted to breastfeed in the Senate since 2003.

The subject is a sensitive issue in many parliaments around the world. In 2016, Spanish MP Carolina Bescansa, from the Podemos (We Can) party, was both criticised and commended for by taking her baby into parliament and breastfeeding him.

Last year, a report on diversity in UK politics recommended that allowing breastfeeding in the House of Commons should be considered.

However, one MP in 2015 warned it could risk ridicule from the tabloid press.",bbc-news

The newly elected president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, has been sworn in after a decisive election victory.

He said he would be willing to visit Pyongyang ""in the right circumstances"".

The 64-year-old human rights lawyer, known for his liberal views, wants to increase contact with North Korea in a departure from current policy.

He has also vowed to unify a divided country reeling from a corruption scandal which saw his predecessor impeached, and improve the economy.

Mr Moon was sworn in as South Korea's 19th president at the National Assembly building in Seoul, filling a leadership vacuum in the wake of Park Geun-hye's removal.

The Democratic Party candidate has positioned himself as the man who can move the country on from the scandal, and has pledged to build ""a just, united country"".

He has also been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development, and has promised to bolster the economy and address youth unemployment, key concerns for voters.

3,Syria war: US to arm Kurds in battle for Raqqa,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption US special forces have been supporting SDF units on the ground

US President Donald Trump has approved supplying weapons to Kurdish forces fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria, the Pentagon says.

Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would be equipped to help drive IS from its stronghold, Raqqa, a spokeswoman said.

The US was ""keenly aware"" of Turkey's concerns about such a move, she added.

Turkey views the Kurdish rebels as terrorists and wants to stop them taking more territory in Syria.

The Pentagon later said US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had spoken by phone to his Turkish counterpart, Fikri Isik, but gave no details of the conversation. Turkish officials have not yet responded publicly.

SDF forces, which comprise Kurdish and Arab militias, are already being supported by elite US forces and air strikes from a US-led coalition.

The US has previously supplied light weapons and armoured vehicles to the Arab element of the SDF, known as the Syrian Arab Coalition.

The SDF is currently battling IS for control of the city of Tabqa, an IS command centre just 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa.

The Kurdish fighters are from the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades.

Last month, Turkey carried out air strikes on YPG positions in Syria which it described as ""terrorist havens"".

Analysis: Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington

The US believes the Kurdish fighters will be essential to Raqqa's downfall.

The Pentagon sees them as the most disciplined and organised of the anti-IS groups but Turkish opposition has meant Washington has had to tread a fine line.

The imminence of the fight for the city means delay is no longer an option and the Kurds will be getting a range of equipment.

US sources say they have received assurances from the Kurds that they will leave Raqqa to be governed by Syrian Arabs after the battle.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is due in Washington next week - he will not be a happy visitor.

A Pentagon source told the BBC the equipment would include ammunition, small arms, machine guns, heavy machine guns, construction equipment such as bulldozers and armoured vehicles.

The source added that the US would ""seek to recover"" the equipment afterwards.

No timeline has been given for when the weapons would start to be supplied.

""We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey,"" said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, who is travelling with Mr Mattis in Lithuania.

""We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the US is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our Nato ally.""

3,Venezuela sees sharp rise in infant and maternal mortality,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Health care workers protested in February in Caracas against President Nicolas Maduro's government, the lack of medicines and low salaries

There has been a sharp rise in infant mortality and maternal death rates in Venezuela.

In the first figures released for two years, the Health Ministry said the number of women dying in childbirth was up by 65%, while child deaths were up 30%.

There has also been a jump in illnesses such as malaria and diphtheria.

The figures reflect the country's deep economic crisis which the opposition says the government has mismanaged.

President Nicolas Maduro says the health crisis is caused by medicines being hoarded to encourage a coup against him.

The country has the largest oil reserves in the world but the collapse of oil prices a few years ago led to a recession and a shortage of the foreign currency needed to import equipment, food and medicines.

Venezuelans face shortages of everything from food to vaccines.

Sorry state of hospitals

UN to supply medicines?

In a recent survey, three-quarters of Venezuelans say their health has plummeted, and that they are eating less than two meals a day. Many report losing an average of around 9 kilos (19 pounds).

In the health sector, large numbers of doctors have emigrated. A leading pharmaceutical association has said around 85% of medicines are in short supply.

Speaking to the Reuters news agency, a critic of the government's health policies, Dr Julio Castro, an infectious disease specialist said:

""The striking part is the turmoil in almost all categories that this bulletin addresses, with particularly significant increased in the infant and maternal health categories.""

Many Venezuelans have trekked to the border with Brazil or Colombia to buy medicine there and seek treatment in public hospitals in neighbouring countries.

In Brazil, the state of Roraima declared a state of emergency to deal with thousands of Venezuelans seeking treatment by the public health service in small border towns.

It is not clear why Venezuela's Health Ministry published its figures now. It had stopped releasing figures after July 2015.

The country has been paralysed for over a month by almost-daily increasingly violent demonstrations against the government of Nicolas Maduro with protestors calling for elections.",bbc-news
10,Microsoft Build 2017: what to expect in major Windows 10 news,"Moved temporarily a few months back and physically a few hundred miles north compared to last year, Microsoft’s Build 2017 developer conference is nearly underway.

With the first keynote set to start on May 10 at 8am PT (11am ET / 4pm BST / 1am May 11 AEST) from Seattle, Washington, Microsoft has plenty to chat about this year despite holding a major media event just last week to tout Windows 10 S and the Surface Laptop.

The most notable topics we expect to see detailed are Redstone 3, the codename for Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update, Project Neon, Microsoft’s visual makeover-in-progress for the operating system (OS), Cortana and even more mixed reality advancements.

With that, here is everything we can bank on seeing during the Build 2017 keynotes starting May 10.

Redstone 3 gets unearthed

Microsoft’s Windows Insider Program members are, technically, already testing out Redstone 3 as you read this. We know this because features that were originally slated for Redstone 2, i.e. the Creators Update, but missed the deadline are now in testing through the latest Insider Preview build of Windows 10 (as of this writing): Build 16188.

Chief among those features left on the Creators Update cutting room floor is My People, a feature that brings your favorite contacts directly into the Windows 10 taskbar for easier file sharing and messaging. Expect to see more of this discussed on stage this week.

Other major expected features to be detailed are PDF editing features in Microsoft Edge (already in the latest Insider Preview build), Power Throttling to reduce apps’ power draw on laptops and tablet PCs and further improvements to more transparent automated OS updates.

We also wouldn’t be surprised to see Redstone 3 get its official name and, at the very least, a release window (if not a hard date) since Microsoft has promised two major updates annually.

Cortana branches out

That Harman Kardon unveiled its Invoke speaker powered by Microsoft’s Cortana just days before Build 2017 is no coincidence. With the long-rumored rival to Amazon Echo and Google Home now out in the open, expect Microsoft to spend some considerable time on this initiative.

In fact, controls for Cortana-powered speakers were already found within the earliest Insider Preview builds for Redstone 3. On that note, expect to hear a lot more about how far the Amazon Alexa-like Cortana Skills and device software developer kits have come since their announcement last year.

However, we find it hard to believe that Microsoft will sit on these tools until Redstone 3 becomes a fancy-named update that hits every Windows 10 device. After all, don’t expect Amazon and Google – or even the rumored Apple Siri Speaker – to slow down over the next five months.

Project Neon ... or Aero Glass 2.0

Microsoft’s fateful fall update should see the oft-teased visual overhaul to the Windows 10 interface known currently as Project Neon.

In short, the new visuals bring back a lot of the translucent design elements found in the Aero Glass design ID that started in Windows Vista and were found throughout Windows 7 before being dropped for Windows 8.

Furthermore, Project Neon markedly changes how Windows 10 animations in transitioning between apps look and feel. That said, early previews have stated that Neon is aiming for a simple aesthetic, so we’ll see how Microsoft achieves that balance with new animations in the mix.

Mixed reality gets a huge push

Unless Microsoft plans to give them a spotlight during its May 23 Surface event, Build 2017 would be the place to show even more of its partners’ head-mounted displays (HMDs).

Having already shown off Acer’s HMD at length during the Taiwanese firm’s annual New York hardware showcase, it’d be surprising not to see already-teased partners like Lenovo, Dell and HP not take the chance to get the word out regarding their Windows 10 Holographic devices.

Bonus round: maybe we’ll finally hear about price regarding any of Microsoft’s partners’ HMD devices. It’s a crucial point going into the holiday season, especially when it’s highly unlikely that either HTC or Facebook have 2017 hardware that can match that $299 starting price.",techradar
10,Amazon Echo Show launched: everything you need to know,"Amazon has finally announced the Amazon Echo Show, the first Echo device equipped with a screen.

The Show follows in the footsteps of the recently announced Amazon Echo Look, which combined Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with a camera that can take pictures and offer style recommendations.

The Show is a radical departure from previous Echo devices as it can provide you with information visually (via its screen) as well as through sound; previous speakers were limited to using voice to communicate.

Cut to the chase

What is it? The newest entry in Amazon's voice-activated line of Echo products

The newest entry in Amazon's voice-activated line of Echo products How much will it cost? $230 (rumored to be £220 in the UK, and AU price tba)

$230 (rumored to be £220 in the UK, and AU price tba) When is it out? June 28 and up for pre-order now on Amazon US with no official UK or AU release date yet announced

Amazon Echo Show release date

Confirming what was rumored earlier today due to a leak, Amazon has announced that the Amazon Echo Show will be released on June 28 in both the US and UK, with pre-orders open now in the US.

That means you'll have to wait a month and a half to get your hands on the new speaker if you order it today in the US.

Although the device is rumored to be coming to the UK simultaneously with the US, no official announcement about UK availability has yet been made.

Since Australia is still yet to receive the Amazon Echo, we're not holding our collective breath for the Echo Show to make its way there anytime soon.

Amazon Echo Show features

As well as the Alexa voice assistant, which we've become familiar with thanks to its inclusion in existing Amazon Echo speakers and Amazon Fire TV devices, the Amazon Echo Show is equipped with both a screen and a webcam, which will allow it to both show you, as well as tell you, information.

The screen is seven inches in size, and is touchscreen-enabled. It's capable of showing notifications, playing internet video, and showing lyrics on Amazon Music, among other things, and it can also facilitate conversations between different devices in the same house.

It'll be interesting to see whether this functionality is expanded in the future to enable the Show to make voice calls outside of the home, as a pre-announcement leak from the WSJ suggested.

The screen can also be configured to show a live video feed from elsewhere in the house through compatible third-party security cameras.

In addition to the screen, the Amazon Echo Show is also equipped with a camera, as is the recently announced Amazon Echo Look. Amazon is pitching the Look as a style accessory, which will, for example, analyse your clothes in order to offer outfit suggestions.

This functionality will presumably also be making its way to the new Amazon Echo Show, although this is yet to be confirmed.

The Show is available in black or white color options.

As well as this new screen and camera functionality, the Show is compatible with Amazon's existing library of skills, which range from ordering cabs with Uber to controlling smart lightbulbs and thermostats, although existing skills will be audio-only until they're made Show-compatible.

The Show is equipped with eight microphones, which is one more than the existing Amazon Echo speaker. Given that the existing Echo is already pretty good at picking up our voice we're unsure why an extra microphone is needed, but it's a nice inclusion all the same.

Finally, the new device is equipped with Bluetooth, so even if your music app of choice isn't supported natively (such as Apple Music), you can still stream it to the Echo Show.

Pre-announcement leaks

We first heard rumors of the Amazon Echo Show a couple of months ago when Cnet reported that Amazon was planning on announcing a screen-equipped Echo device.

That report claimed the device, which we now know to be the Amazon Echo Show, was planned for later in the year, but its release was pushed forward after fears that Google Home was progressing more quickly than expected.

Then, just a few days ago, AFTVnews discovered a low-resolution image of the new device, codenamed the Echo 'Knight', on Amazon's servers. When it posted the discovery on Twitter, journalist Evan Blass responded with a much higher-resolution version of the same image.

@AFTVnews Here, let me help you with that. pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5, 2017

This week saw the leak of an announcement date of May 9, followed by a further leak of the price, release date, and name.

Between all of these leaks we've built up a pretty good idea of what the new device should be capable of, and most of the leaks have now been confirmed by the official announcement.",techradar
10,Here's what the OS that could replace* Android and Chrome OS looks like,"Fuchsia, the mysterious new operating system from Google, has taken another step forward, lifting the veil on its user interface.

Screenshots have surfaced showing Fuchsia's UI so far, giving users and programmers alike their first real glance at Google's new OS, as reported by Ars Technica.

Unlike Chrome OS and Android, which are built on Linux kernel, Fuchsia is based on a Google-made microkernel called Magenta. According to Google programmers, Magenta's focus is on ""modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors.""

Though it's currently just speculation, it's possible that Fuchsia could be the beginning of a new software standard for Google-made products. The search giant is rumored to be trimming the edges on its operating systems, as seen by it bridging some apps between Android and Chrome OS last year.

As for Fuchsia, the new OS uses a current default system UI called Armadillo to build its layout and manage widgets. You can see how it compares visually to its Google-made kin in the images below:

Image 1 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 2 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 3 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica)

From first glance, Fuchsia maintains similar notes to Chrome OS and Android, such as clear-cut widgets and a colorful palette for windows on apps and notifications. Also noticeable are entire sections of the interface dedicated to Google's search functions and suggested content.

However, you can get a better idea what sets Fuchsia apart when it's in motion, a such as in the video below, courtesy of Kyle Bradshaw of Hotfix.net:

To be clear, Google hasn't stated any plans to actively replace Android or Chrome OS at this time, nor has it given a timeframe for when we might see its experimental new OS make its way to consumer products (if at all.)

That said, as we near ever closer to the Google IO 2017 conference next week, we might be lucky enough to learn more about what the tech giant has planned for its latest creation. In the meantime, the open-source files are available via GitHub for any crafty coders looking to dive into Fuchsia for themselves.

Slim design

No need to bring cables

Short charging cables

Not suitable for USB-C

If you're looking for a slim charger you can slide into your bag's front pocket, this option from Iceworks is going to suit you nicely. There's no need to carry around a cable with this version, as the charging cables are built directly into the body.

Be warned, the Iceworks 5,000mAh charger will only work with micro USB (older Android devices) and Lightning (newer iPhone models) as there's no USB-C cable on here.

Poweradd Pilot 2GS

Metal and sleek

High capacity

Quick recharge

Still quite heavy

Poweradd also offers a great slim portable charger, and it's one of the cheapest options on this list yet boasts a substantial 10,000mAh cell inside.

It may be quite heavy, but this is only 1.3cm thick, making it a great device to slip into your back pocket when you're out and about. You'll want to grab a cable to go with it though as unlike the Iceworks choice above it doesn't come with one built in.

Lepow Portable External Battery Charger

A better design than the rest

Interesting design

Super portable

Takes a while to charge

The best looking device we've chosen is the Lepow portable charger. It comes in a variety of colors and can be easily slipped into your pocket, as it's much smaller than many options on this list.

You will need to make sure you have a cable with you to connect it up to your device, but it comes with a 5,000mAh battery inside, which is enough to charge up almost any smartphone at least once.

Best portable chargers with lots of ports

MAXOAK 50000mAh

A whole six ports

Six ports

Huge battery

Large design

This may not be the most portable charger on our list, but it features a lot of ports, so you can charge multiple devices at the same time. It'll even charge laptops as well as your phone and tablet.

You can charge six devices at once, and with a 50,000mAh capacity it has the juice to do that, so if you're usually surrounded by a lot of tech this is possibly one of the best chargers to buy.

Qi-infinity Upgraded 35,000mAh Powerbank

Huge in battery and size

Four ports

35,000mAh size

Large design

Doesn't work with all laptops

Looking for a another option with lots of ports on it? This may be a good choice for you, as there are four ports and you can charge up your MacBook as well as USB devices such as your phone.

There's a quick charge port too, which will fast charge compatible devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7.

ZeroLemon ToughJuice Rugged Portable Charger

One you can throw around

Four ports

Surprisingly portable

Not a huge capacity for the price

After a rugged charger that won't break if it takes a beating? The ZeroLemon ToughJuice pack could be a great choice for you, as it comes with a solid design that isn't too large to slip into your bag or even your back pocket.

It also features four USB ports, so you're able to charge a number of devices all at the same time.

Best portable chargers for laptops and phones

RAVPower Universal Power Bank Travel Charger

One for your laptop

AC output

20,100mAh capacity

Big design

RAVPower's portable charger is a great choice if you need a device that can charge both your laptop and your phone. It features USB-C and normal USB outputs as well as an AC output, so you can plug your laptop charger directly in.

Poweradd Pilot Pro2

The white option

23,000mAh capacity

Easy to see display

Not particularly portable

The picture above may be deceptive, as this isn't a small charger and is capable of charging up your laptop or tablet as well as your phone simultaneously.

You can charge up to three devices at the same time and it comes with a 23,000mAh capacity, so it should last long enough between recharges.

Bestek Car Jump Starter

Something different

Huge capacity

Can jump start a car

Not very portable

The largest charger in this category (in terms of size, though not capacity) is also one of the most innovative, as this one can even jump start your car.

It features a huge 13,600mAh battery that can give your car that much needed jolt whenever you need it to, but also comes with various ports for your phone or laptop to charge as well.",techradar
10,Has Meizu's quick charge tech reinvented the smartphone?,"Do you carry a portable charger for your smartphone? They seem innocent enough, but those small black boxes are like a sticking plaster over the tech industry's gaping wound; pathetic phone batteries not fit for the modern mobile age.

It's not just the Pokémon Go app that drains the life from smartphones, with navigation apps like Google Maps, firmware updates, and even just the camera app eating away at battery life at a worrying rate.

So could a claim by Chinese phone maker Meizu that it now has the technology to recharge a phone in less than 20 minutes change everything?

Super mCharge is expected to be used in phones inside two years. © Jamie Carter

Short battery life is a huge problem for the phone industry, whose minor improvements in power efficiency have been swallowed up by the ever-increasing size of smartphone screens.

""Smartphones have become more power-hungry, and battery life and charging technology has failed to keep pace, leaving users often unsatisfied with the battery life of their devices,"" says James Manning Smith, Information Analyst at Futuresource Consulting.

He points out that manufacturers have three choices when designing a phone; larger batteries in devices, more efficient components, and making charging more convenient for users.

Meizu has taken the middle road with its Super mCharge technology, which it unveiled at a press event at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona. The live demo saw an empty smartphone fill-up in precisely 18 minutes and 55 seconds.

Not exactly a riveting watch for onlookers, but impressive nonetheless. After over a year of R&D, said Meizu, it had improved the power of a Super mCharge battery to 55W, and accelerated charging speed by 5.5 times.

© Jamie Carter

An industry first

That 55W figure is key. “Meizu's 55W charging is a first for the mobile industry,” says Manning Smith, who confirms that it's a more powerful charging solution than anything already on the market.

“Standard USB charging is 5W, while some OEMs have released phones with 15-18W charging, such as Motorola, Samsung and Oppo.”

The battery inside the Meizu demo phone was 3,000mAh, which is a typical size for a smartphone (for comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8 uses a 3,000mAh battery, while the iPhone 7 claims a 1,960mAh battery), though this one was specially designed by Meizu's engineers to bear more than four times the current so it could work with Super mCharge.

So what has Meizu actually achieved here? As well as taking charging to 55W, Meizu has dramatically accelerated the charging speed.

Technically speaking, Super mCharge uses charge pump technology; comprising two groups of circuits, the charge pump exports half of the voltage after transformation and improves efficiency by 8%.

""Our solution yields 98% efficiency, compared with other companies who struggle to hit 90%,"" claims Meizu.

Super mCharge also uses a USB cable that's been redesigned to carry up to 160W of power, and as a result it does cost three times more than a regular USB cable.

Can the Meizu phone stand the heat?

There are two immediate concerns. Firstly, does fast charging mean the battery won't last very long? Secondly, is all that extra heat generated safe? After all, exploding batteries in smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 have made us all nervous.

On the first question, Meizu insists that in tests its 3,000mAh battery retained more than 80 percent of its capacity after 800 charge and discharge cycles, so it should be good for two years' normal use.

On the second concern about safety, Meizu claims that its optimization algorithm means the highest temperature the battery reaches is 39°C/102°F (in an ambient temperature of 22°C/72°F), just a bit higher than body temperature.

Manning Smith explains that since smartphones are very condensed devices, engineering restrictions mean the heat that builds up during high-powered charging can damage the battery, and other components in the phone.

""Meizu has developed a technology that allows the battery to be charged at a very high rate, without exceeding dangerous temperature levels,"" he adds.

Quick Charge 4.0 features on the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. © Jamie Carter

This is all impressive stuff, but only if the device can live up to Meizu's promises. ""Once the technology comes to market, it has the potential to set a new standard for wired smartphone charging,"" says Manning Smith.

That should happen during 2019 or 2020, but there's no guaranteed success for Super mCharge. Not only are several other similar innovations expected in that time-frame, but the general trend towards super-fast wired charging for phones looks set to be overtaken by the wireless charging era.

When it comes to super-fast wired charging, Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 (QC3.0) for Android devices is the current front-runner, with QC4.0 just announced for new flagship Android phones that use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset – and that includes the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, ZTE Gigabit and some versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8.

QC4.0 claims to charge 20% faster than QC3.0 (which charges an empty phone to 50% in about 30 minutes). That's not as impressive as Super mCharge's promised speeds, but then again it's available already.

Can Meizu's technology compete with wireless pads?

""Wireless charging companies are trying to [create] a world in which charging cables are unnecessary,"" says Manning Smith, who admits that support for wireless charging pads in wider society is in its infancy.

However, Aircharge has been installing wireless charging stations in restaurants, airports and hotels, while IKEA is including wireless charging pads in some furniture.

""Should we see an increase in the availability of wireless charging outlets in our daily lives, there may be less need for fast charging technologies,"" Manning Smith says.

There are also efforts to develop high-wattage wireless charging. Bosch has wireless charging for power tools that it plans to take up to 60W and use in all kinds of mobile devices by 2020, which would surpass Meizu's achievement – while LG has been developing wireless charging pads that bring a fully discharged phone up to 50% in 30 minutes, (so on a par with QC3.0).

“The convenience of cable-free, little-and-often charges that wireless charging can provide may be more convincing for consumers than wired, but quick charging,” says Manning Smith.

So while Meizu's Super mCharge is an exciting achievement, the future belongs not to electrochemical cells, but wireless charging pads – probably starting with your car.",techradar
6,Analysis: James Comey's firing won't end election controversy over Russia,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The White House reports Comey's dismissal comes after he was found in the middle of several political controversies like Russia's possible election interference and Hillary Clinton's handling of classified e-mails. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Just last week, President Trump was on Twitter accusing FBI Director James Comey of being too soft on his election opponent, Hillary Clinton.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!"" Trump tweeted May 2.

A week later, Trump sacked Comey — but for the exact opposite reason. Moments after announcing Comey's firing, the White House released a Justice Department letter that claimed Comey had inappropriately disparaged Clinton during the election campaign — and overstepped his bounds in publicly disclosing that he had reopened his investigation into the former secretary of State's emails.

Only Trump knows the real reason for Comey's firing.

But in his letter to Comey informing him of his dismissal, Trump issued what appeared a Shakespearean protestation: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump wrote to Comey on Tuesday.

Indeed, Comey was leading what appeared to be an open-ended investigation into Russian interference in the election — and what Trump associates knew about it. ""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?"" Trump tweeted Monday.

But Comey's firing will have the immediate effect of intensifying calls for an independent investigation to probe that very question.

After all, Comey was thrust into the role of refereeing the 2016 election because political appointees in the Obama and Trump administrations had been seen as incapable of doing so.

Former attorney general Loretta Lynch was forced to recuse herself from the Clinton probe after an ill-considered meeting with former president Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix in the midst of the investigation into his wife's emails.

Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama holdover, was fired 10 days into the Trump administration — four days after she warned the White House that Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was susceptible to Russian blackmail.

And Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, also had to recuse himself after misleading Congress about his own contacts with the Russian government while he served as a high-profile supporter of Trump's campaign.

So the political maelstrom Comey found himself in wasn't entirely of his own making. Still, Comey did not shun the spotlight that came with those politically sensitive investigations, holding unusually expository press conferences and giving freewheeling congressional testimony.

If there were any doubt that Comey was a pivotal figure in the 2016 presidential election, his firing as FBI director Tuesday should settle the issue for the history books.

It's a history that is still being written.

WASHINGTON – James Comey was supposed to have at least six more years in his term as FBI director.

Now that he’s been abruptly fired by President Trump, the White House has launched a search to replace him.

Who could take his place? Neither the FBI nor Justice Department would provide any leads. But there could be some clues.

Four years ago, when then-President Barack Obama selected Comey to succeed Robert Mueller, his name came from a list of potential candidates who may now have a new chance at the office.

The most-discussed names in that pool included some of most familiar names in national law enforcement, along with a former member of Congress.

Before Comey’s selection was announced in 2013, former Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, was the favorite of the FBI Agents Association, a group of 13,000 current and former agents.

""Chairman Rogers exemplifies the principles that should be possessed by the next FBI director,"" then-FBIAA President Konrad Motyka said at the time, announcing the association's support for Rogers. ""His unique and diverse experience as a veteran FBI agent and member of Congress will allow him to effectively lead the men and women of the bureau as they continue their work to protect our country from criminal and terrorist threats.""

Ken Wainstein, a former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, was another favorite.

Earlier this week, Wainstein made a public appearance, even though he stayed off to the sidelines. He served as counsel to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during a Monday appearance before a Senate subcommittee exploring Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Previously, he served as the FBI's general counsel and Mueller's chief of staff at the bureau.

At the Justice Department, Wainstein also once served as the chief federal prosecutor in D.C., and the director of the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, where he oversaw the operations of 94 federal prosecutors' offices in the U.S.

Another potential pick: John Pistole. Before his appointment as president of Anderson University in Indiana three years ago, the former deputy director of the FBI, had won notice for his steady direction of the Transportation Security Administration.

Pistole also is a close friend of Comey who attended the former TSA director's induction as Anderson University president.

Some current and former FBI agents also have pointed to Michael Mason, a former executive assistant FBI director, as a candidate for the top job.

Before leaving the bureau, Mason oversaw criminal and cyber investigations, coordinated international operations and the bureau's crisis response operations.

Two former New York officials were also linked to previous discussions about top jobs at the bureau and the Justice Department: former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

Giuliani, a high-profile surrogate for the Trump campaign, had been considered for a number of positions in the new administration, including attorney general and secretary of State. Meanwhile, Kelly is an executive at a private security firm.

As the search continues, the FBI is being headed by Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

But McCabe, who helped oversee the bureau's contentious investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, also has drawn heat.

McCabe's wife, a candidate for state office in Virginia, was the recipient of nearly $500,000 raised by an organization linked to Clinton ally and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The FBI claimed that the deputy director played no role in the campaign.

What does it say about your presidency when Richard Nixon's presidential library is mocking you?

""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian,"" the library tweeted Tuesday within a couple hours of the announcement of President Trump firing FBI Director James Comey.

FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector#notNixonianpic.twitter.com/PatArKOZlk — RichardNixonLibrary (@NixonLibrary) May 9, 2017

It's true that Nixon never fired a FBI director. That honor goes to Bill Clinton, who was the first (and up until Tuesday, the only) president to fire a FBI director. Back in 1993, Clinton fired William Sessions over ethical concerns. Sessions had refused to step down voluntarily.

Still, #Nixonian was trending Tuesday night after Comey's firing. In what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon made a controversial move when he ordered the firing Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor charged with the investigation into the Watergate scandal. That led to the resignations of his attorney general, Elliott Richardson, and his deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus.

WASHINGTON — President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey in the middle of several investigations of possible Trump campaign ties to last year’s Russian meddling in U.S. elections caused a firestorm of protest from Democratic members of Congress, with many calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

Some equated the firing with events known as the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" during the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he told Trump that he had made a “big mistake” when informed of the decision.

Schumer wondered aloud whether the firing meant Comey’s investigation was “getting too close to home,” and he said the handling of a credible investigation depends on Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein naming a “fearless, independent” special prosecutor.

“Mr. Rosenstein, America depends on you to restore faith in our criminal justice system which is going to be badly shattered after the administration’s actions today,"" Schumer said.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona called for the creation of a special congressional committee on Russia, while Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said he and his staff were ""reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia.""

""James Comey is a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" McCain said.

Comey, a Republican who had served in the George W. Bush administration as second in command in the Justice Department, was the surprise choice of President Barack Obama for the FBI post.

He had established his independence in March 2004 when then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales sought to get Comey’s boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft, to sign off on a secret National Security Agency wiretap program. Ashcroft, seriously ill in the hospital with pancreatitis, had turned his duties over to Comey, who told Gonzales in Ashcroft’s hospital room that he refused to authorize the program.

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the troubled House intelligence committee, said the firing raised profound questions about White House interference in a criminal probe.

“The decision by a president whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an Attorney General who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,” Schiff said, likening the event to the Watergate firings.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., suggested Trump’s action poses serious constitutional issues, while others called the development “Nixonian.”

“The termination and removal of James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raises the critical question as to whether the FBI investigation of Russian interference in the last presidential campaign will continue,” Durbin said.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate committee probing the Trump-Russia connection, called the firing “outrageous.”

“I have been long been a critic of Director Comey ... but Donald Trump’s decision to fire him now, in the midst of an investigation into Trump associates and their ties to Russia, is outrageous,"" Wyden said. He said Comey should be called to testify before Congress about the status of the Trump-Russia investigation.

“The president would do well to remember that in America, the truth always comes out.”

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who questioned Comey at a hearing before a Judiciary subcommittee this week, said the way Trump is handling the firing “is shocking.”

“No one should accept President Trump’s absurd justification that he is now concerned that FBI Director Comey treated Secretary Clinton unfairly,” Leahy said. “The president has removed the sitting FBI Director in the midst of one of the most critical national security investigations in the history of our country. This is nothing less than Nixonian.”

Leahy also noted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom the president consulted before the firing, was supposed to have recused himself. He said Rosenstein now has no choice but to appoint a special counsel.

A long list of others calling for an independent probe included Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Ben Cardin, D-Md., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., along with good government advocacy groups MoveOn.org and Common Cause.

Others reacted with more measured tones. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said simply that she had been informed by the president of his decision by phone, adding, “the next FBI director must be strong and independent and will receive a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee.”

One of the earliest Republican reactions came from Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn.: “While the case for removal of (FBI Director Comey) laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions.""

News of Comey’s departure came near the end of an hourlong telephone town hall meeting that House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., was having with constituents. “Lisa in Mendham” said she wanted to know what Congress was going to do now to hold Trump accountable “for his potentially breaking the law in dealing with Russia.”

Frelinghuysen didn’t answer that question directly but gave a positive appraisal of the job Comey has done.

“He had the reputation ... like his predecessor Robert Muller, of being a sort of straight-arrow guy,” Frelinghuysen said. “I do think he was an honorable man and represented an amazing department. I'm surprised he's gone. But in this business, I guess nothing is too surprising.”

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — After railing against FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, Democrats aligned with her presidential campaign reacted to his firing not with satisfaction — but with deep suspicion.

Among the former Clinton officials weighing in was her campaign manager Robby Mook. Despite frustration and disappointment over the way Comey handled the Clinton investigation, the announcement “terrifies me,” said Mook.

Twilight zone. I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled. But this terrifies me. — Robby Mook (@RobbyMook) May 9, 2017

Brian Fallon, who was a top communications official during the campaign, said he’s “not shedding any tears for Comey,” even as his firing makes him “worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now.”

I'm not shedding any tears for Comey personally -he hurt FBI's reputation- but I do worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) May 9, 2017

In a letter to Comey, Trump cited as cause for the FBI director’s firing his handling of the investigation into Clinton’s private email server, including public statements he made leading up to the presidential election. Yet Comey’s judgment over the email investigation has been an issue for several months. As recently as late January, Trump was seen patting Comey on the back during a White House reception to honor law enforcement officers.

What’s new is that Comey’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump campaign officials is heating up, including whether there is any evidence of collusion between the two as Russia sought to bolster Trump’s campaign and hurt Clinton’s, according to numerous U.S. intelligence agencies.

The firing also comes days after Comey testified before Congress about his handling of the email investigation during which he mistakenly stated that the FBI had obtained thousands of new emails from a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. While the FBI later corrected the misstatement, it appears to have given the White House an opening to fire the FBI director.

Comey came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats throughout the course of the Clinton investigation. It was days before the Nov. 8, 2016, election that Comey announced his team had found additional emails on the laptop of her aide, Huma Abedin, which the Clinton campaign blames for depressing votes in critical battlegrounds that Clinton lost to Trump by a small margin. During the hearing, Comey said he was “mildly nauseous” if his actions had any effect on the presidential election, while insisting he had no choice but to inform the public about the emails.

They also faulted Comey for speaking out about the investigation in July, when he explain why he decided against bringing charges against Clinton.

It was a break with normal FBI protocol, yet Comey may have felt pressure to speak out after former President Bill Clinton drew criticism for boarding the plane and having a private conversation with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

WASHINGTON — White House officials say President Trump based his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday on the ""clear recommendations"" of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a memo released Tuesday evening, Rosenstein sharply criticized the FBI chief, saying he mishandled the final stages of investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's treatment of classified State Department emails. The firing was needed to restore public confidence in the agency, Rosenstein concluded.

At the heart of the criticism: Comey's various public pronouncements about the investigation during the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. On July 5, Comey held a news conference in which he said no charges would be filed against Clinton. But on Oct 28, Comey announced that the probe had been reopened to examine newly discovered emails. Then, two days before before election, Comey once again weighed in, saying the department still was not recommending charges against the former secretary of State.

Here are key points in Rosenstein's memo:

1. ""The FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice. That is deeply troubling to many department employees and veterans, legislators and citizens.""

2. ""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unifies people of diverse perspectives.""

3. ""The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors.""

4. ""Compounding the error: The director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

5. ""Although the president has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former department officials. The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong.""

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Danny Green scored seven of his 16 points in overtime, and the San Antonio Spurs overcame an injury to Kawhi Leonard to beat James Harden and the Houston Rockets 110-107 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their second-playoff series.

Leonard had 22 points and 15 rebounds in 38 minutes before exiting with an injured right ankle. Leonard stepped on Harden's foot with 5:37 left in the third quarter and then played limited minutes before sitting out overtime.

Harden had 33 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. He had a chance at potential tying 3-pointer in the final seconds of OT, but was blocked from behind by Manu Ginobili.

""I know where his shot release is from,"" Ginobili said. ""I tried to bother him as much as I could. It was a risky play, but it was also risky to let him shoot.""

MANU. SEALED IT.#NBAPlayoffspic.twitter.com/0ewMHivxYY — NBA.com (@NBAcom) May 10, 2017

Aside from the block, Ginobili had 12 points, seven rebounds and five assists off the bench in the win. He also had a surprising dunk that he described as ""unexpected.""

""Manu reached back and gave us one of his Manu performances from past years,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He was a stud.""

Game 6 is Thursday in Houston.

Latest NBA playoff coverage:

Each team stalled at the start of the extra period. Patrick Beverley made a 3-pointer with 2 minutes remaining for the first points of the period, giving Houston a 104-101 lead.

Green made a go-ahead 3-pointer and converted a three-point play to make it 109-107 Spurs with 30.1 seconds left. He also made a foul shot down the stretch to help San Antonio hold on.

""The competitiveness was off the charts,"" Popovich said. ""Either team could've won the game down the stretch.""

Two questionable plays closed regulation with the game tied at 101.

Harden was whistled for a charge after dribbling all but a few seconds off the shot clock before driving to the basket on Jonathon Simmons. The Spurs failed to take a shot on their final possession, with Patty Mills banking in a 3-pointer after the buzzer sounded.

""We let one slip away,"" Harden said. ""Execution, rebounding. Two primary things we let slip away.""

Harden also played solid defense, helping hold Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge to 15-for-42 shooting as he rotated assignments in Houston's smaller lineup. But he finished with nine turnovers.

With the Rockets leading 82-81, officials ruled a ball out of bounds on the Spurs that replays showed was actually off Harden. Beverley drained a 3-pointer on the ensuing possession, prompting San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich to scream and point at official Derrick Stafford.

The play ignited what had been a rather listless San Antonio, leading to a 10-2 run bridging the third and fourth quarters for a 92-87 lead.

The Spurs tried to exploit a size advantage over the Rockets' small lineup early, especially when Harden was guarding either Aldridge and Pau Gasol. The Spurs' big men only managed 2-for-5 shooting in the opening three minutes, leading San Antonio to abandon the strategy midway through the first quarter and sub Simmons for Gasol.

Simmons responded by scoring 10 points on 5-for-13 shooting in 26 minutes.

TIP-INS

Rockets: Houston has lost four straight best-of-seven series when it was tied 2-2. The last time the Rockets won a series after being tied 2-2 was in the 1995 Western Conference finals when they beat the Spurs. . Nene is out for the remainder of the postseason after tearing his left adductor in Game 4. . The team that led at the half had won every game in the series until Game 5.

Spurs: Ginobili has 313 3-pointers in his postseason career, which is third in league history behind Ray Allen (385) and Reggie Miller (320). . Ginobili drove the lane for a one-handed dunk with 2 minutes left in the first half.

WASHINGTON — President Trump stunned the political world by firing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, an abrupt ending to a tenure marked by political controversies ranging from the Trump campaign's connections to Russia to Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails.

Basing his decision on the recommendations from both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Trump said in a statement that ""the FBI is one of our nation’s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement.""

The search for a new permanent FBI director will begin immediately, the White house said.

In recommending Comey's firing, the Justice Department leadership excoriated the FBI director for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. In a letter to Comey released by the White House, Trump agreed he ""was not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

Yet Comey's sudden dismissal calls into question the future of the investigation into Russian hacking of the 2016 presidential election. The FBI is currently in the midst of a full-blown counterintelligence inquiry, exploring charges of possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

Democrats — including some who had previously attacked Comey for his handling of the Clinton probe — saw Trump's move as a blatant attempt to short-circuit the Russia investigation.

""This is nothing less than Nixonian,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a reference to President Richard Nixon's decision in 1973 to remove the Watergate special prosecutor.

And Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's decision to fire the man overseeing a federal investigation into his campaign associates' collusion with Russia ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter.""

Schiff, whose panel is conducting a separate investigation into Russia's influence on the presidential election, called for an independent prosecutor ""to restore a modicum of public confidence — now completely lacking — that the criminal investigation will continue without further interference by the White House.""

If Trump were truly upset with Comey about his handling of the Clinton probe, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, he could have fired Comey on his first day in office. Instead, the Senate's top Democrat said, the president waited until Congress and FBI investigations into Russia heated up.

""Given the way the President has fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration,"" Schumer said. Without an independent special prosecutor, he added, ""every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up.""

For his part, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Trump's actions ""threaten"" the critical investigations now underway ""and the integrity and independence of the FBI.""

5 key points in memo calling for FBI Director James Comey's firing

In his termination letter, Trump referred to the FBI's ongoing investigation, telling Comey he appreciated him ""informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

Still, the concern about the timing of Comey's firing was not limited to Democrats.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., who is leading the Senate panel’s investigation into Russia’s election interference, said he was “troubled’’ by both the timing and reasons for Comey’s dismissal. ""I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the committee,’’ Burr said. “In my interactions with the director and with the bureau under his leadership, he and the FBI have always been straightforward with our committee.

“Director Comey has been more forthcoming with information than any FBI director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intelligence committees,"" he continued. ""His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.”

A career prosecutor, Comey, held top Justice Department posts in the George W. Bush administration before being appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

He is only the second director fired in the 82-year history of the FBI. President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions in 1993 amid ethics problems. While FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms in order to make them nominally non-partisan, they can still be fired by the president.

As news of Comey's dismissal raced through Washington on Tuesday night, Republicans defended the move as difficult but necessary.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Comey's ""decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts.""

Meanwhile, Comey was apparently finding out his own employment status in an unconventional way.

Comey left Washington earlier Tuesday for a speaking engagement, and was not informed of his firing until he saw news reports of it on television while at the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, a person familiar with the matter said.

The abrupt firing came just after the FBI confirmed Comey provided erroneous testimony to a Senate panel about how Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin handled classified emails.

Notably, some of the same Democrats upset about Comey's firing have also previously called for his head, blaming Clinton's loss of the presidency on Comey's unexpected public announcement on Oct. 28 that he was re-opening the investigation into her emails.

Rosenstein, confirmed by the Senate two weeks ago as Comey's day-to-day supervisor, also faulted Comey for announcing he had re-opened the case 11 days before the election — and for his earlier July 5 news conference saying no charges would be filed against Clinton.

In a memo to the attorney general, Rosenstein said he did not understand Comey's refusal to acknowledge fault with his actions.

""Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of different perspectives,"" Rosenstein wrote.

Late Tuesday, Attorney General Sessions sent a message to the entire FBI, saying that Trump had “exercised his lawful authority to remove’’ Comey.

“By operation of law and effective immediately, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe assumed the position of acting director of the FBI,’’ Sessions wrote. “As you well know, the FBI is an exceptional law enforcement agency. It is made by you, the devoted men and women who work tirelessly to keep our country safe. Thank you for your steadfast dedication and commitment during this time of transition.’’

How did we get here? A James Comey timeline

Tweets fly fast and furious following firing of FBI head Comey

James Comey is one of several officials President Trump fired

Meanwhile, as Comey remains the target of public criticism over his handling of the Clinton case, the Justice Department’s inspector general is in the midst of wide-ranging review of Justice’s handling of the matter, including Comey’s leadership of it.

Last week, Comey disclosed in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had been interviewed by Justice investigators assigned to the case and expected to be questioned again.

“I have a story to tell,’’ Comey told the panel.

Comey, 56, succeeded Robert Mueller, the longest serving FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover. Mueller served for 12 years before leaving the bureau.

A former chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan and former deputy attorney general, Comey won plaudits for his independence as a key player in one of the most dramatic moments during the George W. Bush administration.

With then-Attorney General John Ashcroft hospitalized in 2004 with acute pancreatitis, Deputy Attorney General Comey rushed to his boss’ bedside at George Washington Hospital when he learned that then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House chief of staff Andrew Card were trying to persuade Ashcroft to reauthorize a controversial warrantless eavesdropping program.

Since taking office, Comey has staked out the highest profile of any director since Hoover.

In any venue, the 6-foot-8-inch Comey is hard to miss. Often referring to himself as an “awkward white guy,’’ he was anything but while delivering testimony before Congress engaging audiences in public and private forums.

Even in high-stakes congressional hearings, Comey often operated without written text and rarely sought advice from aides who accompanied him.

His public and controversial handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation was only the latest in a string of public positions that the director took that did not always sit well with the White House and the Justice Department — including under Obama's administration.

He bluntly acknowledged law enforcement’s fraught relationship with the racial and ethnic communities in addresses at Georgetown University and in Birmingham, Ala., and has suggested that less-aggressive policing may be contributing to spikes in violent crime in some parts of the country—a position that put him at odds with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Obama White House.

He drew the wrath of the tech industry and privacy advocates last year as the face of the government’s legal battle with Apple Inc., to gain access to the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook. With Apple insisting that creating a way to break into the device's default encryption would be tantamount to giving the FBI a ""backdoor"" that could be used to break into Apple products again and again, Comey described the dispute as the “hardest problem I’ve encountered in my entire government career.’’

At another point, Comey acknowledged the vexing nature of battling homegrown violent extremists, ticking off a list of recent bloody assaults and attempted attacks that have scarred communities across the country, from Garland, Texas to Orlando, Fla. His public concern about the FBI's capacity to confront the growing homegrown threat, prompted lawmakers to question whether the bureau had the resources to deal with it.

As the White House searches for a replacement, FBI Agents Association President Thomas O’Connor called on the Trump administration to proceed with “caution.""

“A change in FBI leadership of this magnitude must be handled carefully and with an eye towards ensuring that the bureau can continue to fulfill its responsibility to protect the American public from criminal and national security threats,’’ O’Connor said.

“We greatly appreciate Director Comey’s service, leadership, and support for special agents during his tenure. He understood the centrality of the agent to the bureau's mission, recognizing that agents put their lives on the line every day. His focus was to ensure that the bureau’s investigations complied with the law and the constitution, and that agents performed their mission with integrity and professionalism. As vital stakeholders, FBI agents should be given a voice in the process of selecting the next director.”

But so far, say leaders and activists in anti-cyber bullying efforts, neither Trump nor her East Wing staff have reached out, nor have they responded to offers to help.

""I'm not seeing any movement towards an initiative that she's endorsed,"" says first lady historian Myra Gutin of Rider University in New Jersey. ""She's hired some staff but not up to the level that other first ladies have done by now.""

Trump's press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, says the anti-cyber bullying effort is still a work in progress. ""Mrs. Trump is being very thoughtful when it comes to building out her initiatives,"" Grisham said in an email. Also, her staff now numbers 10, and she's taking her time hiring because she values ""quality over quantity.""

Trump herself declined to comment, as she has routinely since she became first lady. But on Nov. 3, 2016, she attracted widespread attention when she announced in a rare speech that she would fight cyber bullying as her first-lady cause if her husband, Donald Trump, were elected.

“Technology has changed our universe. But like anything that is powerful it can have a bad side,"" she told an audience of suburban women in Berwyn, Pa. ""Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and to teenagers.”

Her declaration brought out plenty of ire on social media from those who consider Donald Trump the definition of a cyber bully given his aggressive social media attacks against anyone who piques his fury.

Lady Gaga, whose Born This Way Foundation aims to combat bullying, especially of LGBT kids, was scathing, though Gaga's representative did not return a message from USA TODAY seeking comment on how she feels about Melania Trump now.

But there was no mocking from other anti-cyber bullying activists, who say they remain patient and hopeful that Trump will launch her initiative soon.

""We have tried to reach out to her and offer the services and expertise of our organization; so far, we have not heard back,"" says Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, founder of the Institute of Digital Media and Child Development in New York. Still, ""I’m delighted that Melania Trump chose cyber bullying. I think she could do a tremendous amount for the children and adolescents who are suffering as a result of it.""

Since the election, excited activists have been sending Trump advice and proposals, such as holding an annual online safety summit at the White House, says Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.

""We haven’t heard anything from FLOTUS at all (so) I’m not in a position to speak to what she is or is not doing since we’re not connected yet,"" says Hinduja.

He says ""everyone in my line of work has been buzzing"" since Trump's speech. He says ""good progress"" has been made on cyber bullying over the last eight years by the White House, the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education.

""And we’re just hoping that there will be continued and even increased support and contributions from the highest office in the land,"" he says. ""That is tremendously exciting for all of us.""

The Family Online Safety Institute welcomed Trump to the cause in December, issuing a set of recommendations such as: Inaugurating an annual Online Safety Summit at the White House; creating a chief online safety officer; and persuading the new administration to set up a $25 million research-and-education fund over five years to create educational programs for children and their parents on cyber bullying and online safety in general.

""We are still waiting to hear from her or her office about how she wishes to take this topic on,"" says Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Washington-based group. ""The only indication we’ve had is that speech before the election. And then, of course, she has mostly remained in New York. So there's not been a great deal of movement yet.

""But of those I've spoken to, including in my own organization, we’re cautiously optimistic.""

Susan Swearer, a psychology professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network, says she's not been contacted by Trump's team. ""It’s such important work and there’s a huge need for creating kinder and supportive online and offline spaces, so I hope FLOTUS decides to engage in this important work,"" she says.

Donna Rice Hughes, a key figure in a 1987 political scandal that ended a Democratic presidential campaign, has been a respected leader on Internet safety for kids for more than two decades through her Enough is Enough non-profit. She endorsed Donald Trump and though she hasn't heard yet from Melania, she is convinced it will happen and that mothers especially will relate to the new FLOTUS.

""She is modeling what it means to have a balanced life and the difficulty most women who have families are having in trying to keep that all in balance,"" says Hughes. ""I am not at all concerned or surprised she's taking some time. It's very clear right now her priority is her son. She’s got four years minimum, maybe eight, to deal with cyber bullying.""

Could President Trump's online blasts undermine the first lady's cause? Possibly, says Balkam, but it would depend on the specifics of her initiative. If she focuses on, say, child-on-child cyber bullying, ""it's possible nothing he does undermines what she tries to do. But let’s wait and see.""

Combating digital bullying is not a new cause nor an inconsequential one, according to the experts and activists who have been laboring in relative obscurity for years, concerned about analysis (from the Cyberbullying Research Center in Orlando, for instance) showing that two-thirds of students who experience cyber bullying say it affected their ability to learn and feel safe at school.

Monica Lewinsky has been a recent high-profile voice on the issue: She called for an end to the ""culture of humiliation"" in a powerful TED talk in 2015. ""Cruelty is nothing new. But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible,"" she said then. ""Millions of people can stab you with their words and that's a lot of pain.""

She would seem to be a perfect ally to Melania Trump — and in fact, she defended the Trumps' young son, Barron, after he was mocked online — but her spokeswoman, Dini von Mueffling, confirmed to USA TODAY that so far Lewinsky has not heard from Trump.

all children need to be protected from bullying + mockery. (incl #barrontrump). let's be better than this. https://t.co/CH3IfdpQpu — Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) January 23, 2017

But nothing beats a first lady's spotlight for focusing attention. So far, Trump has said nothing about cyber bullying in public, except on April 26, when she celebrated her 47th birthday at a lunch for Senate spouses at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

Grisham confirmed Trump mentioned cyber bullying at the lunch, thanking the group for a donation they made in her name to an anti-bullying organization, which is the tradition of the Senate spouses group for every incoming new first lady. But the lunch was closed to the media at the behest of the group so there's no official transcript.

Soon after the election, Donald Trump said his third wife would not move into the White House immediately after the inauguration; instead, she would remain in New York so that Barron, 11, could finish the school year.

Grisham maintains she's still been ""100% present"" as first lady since Jan. 20, and anyway nowadays people can work remotely from anywhere.

For comparison, Michelle Obama also said her first priority would be her children when she became first lady in 2009, though she immediately was visible and active. She did not fully launch her first initiative, her campaign for healthy eating and against childhood obesity, until nine months after she came to the White House.

""With Mrs. Trump, who's not living here yet and who's just starting to assemble her team, it may take a little longer to roll out her first initiative, but it will be done with a level of full knowledge, research and careful attention to the important data out there on this issue,"" predicts Anita McBride, who worked in multiple administrations, was former first lady Laura Bush's chief of staff and now studies the legacies of first ladies at American University in Washington.

But her absence has been noticed: Stylish and statuesque, the ex-model stands out when she is present, stimulating further curiosity about her. But she remains largely inscrutable; unlike her polished stepdaughter, businesswoman-turned-White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, Melania has not done media interviews about her plans.

Does it matter that Trump has been a slow-starting FLOTUS?

Every new first lady takes a different approach, says McBride, and it's nothing to worry about. ""We may have to get used to, with this new first lady, she's not going to do it the way her predecessors did it; she's going to do it the way it fits her best. That may be more limited but it will be just as impactful.""

First-lady expert Kate Andersen

Brower,

author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies,

says she's sympathetic to the notion that Trump needs more time to understand the job. ""While they get a honeymoon period, I think that's quickly coming to an end,"" Andersen Brower says.

Gutin suspects most people don't care, but she thinks Trump is missing an opportunity.

""The tradition is that the presidential spouse gives us some insight into the character of the president, and certainly since Jacqueline Kennedy those of us who care about it have always thought the first lady can use (the White House audience) to do a lot of good,"" Gutin says. ""Does it matter to the success of an administration? Probably not. But there is the opportunity there and she's not taking advantage of it.""

Or not yet, anyway.

9,Spurs win epic Game 5 over Rockets with Kawhi Leonard on the bench in OT | FOX Sports,"The Spurs got a 110-107 overtime win over the Rockets in Tuesday’s Game 5 to take a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series. And they did it with their best player in Kawhi Leonard sidelined for the entire overtime session.

Leonard suffered what appeared to be an ankle injury earlier in the game, and tried his best to play through it. But once it became clear that he couldn’t go, Gregg Popovich made the difficult decision to bench him down the stretch. Thanks to huge plays from Danny Green and Manu Ginobili — along with some brutal offensive possessions from James Harden and the Rockets, especially in overtime — San Antonio was able to win in spite of Leonard’s absence.

Leonard had to lean on Ginobili as he walked off the court following the Spurs win. Popovich told reporters after the game San Antonio doesn’t yet know Leonard’s status moving forward.

Harden finished with 33 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. But he also committed nine turnovers, while shooting just 4-of-15 from three-point distance.

Kawhi Leonard suffered a lower leg injury in the second half on Tuesday when he landed on James Harden’s foot, an injury that forced the two-time Defensive Player of the Year to miss San Antonio’s final possession of regulation and the entirety of overtime.

But the Spurs received some good news after the game. Leonard, who was walking with a pronounced limp, told reporters he won’t miss Game 6 on Thursday in Houston.

""Yeah, I'm gonna be able to play."" -Kawhi Leonard (ankle) #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/ZXwGtqcQMa — NBA TV (@NBATV) May 10, 2017

LEONARD: “It’s a little sore, but I mean, my teammates did a good job of closing out that game with me not being able to go that last stretch.”

REPORTER: “Is it an ankle or knee?”

LEONARD: “Ankle.” […]

REPORTER: “Pop said you wanted to play, but it was obvious that you needed to come out. How severe of an injury is it? Do you think you’ll be able to play in Game 6?”

LEONARD: “Yeah, I’m going to be able to play.”

Leonard naturally struggled for most of the second half following the injury, finishing with 22 points on 8-for-21 shooting, along with 15 rebounds and four assists.

The Spurs got a huge boost from Manu Ginobili with Leonard on the bench, as the 15-year veteran came up with a massive block on Harden on the final possession of overtime to seal San Antonio’s win.

The question now for the Spurs is how limited Leonard might be in what could be a close-out Game 6. Even before the Leonard injury, San Antonio reverted to its switch-heavy defense, rather than having its franchise player try to lock down Harden for most of the night.

If Leonard isn’t 100 percent on Thursday, it stands to reason the Spurs would use a similar defensive tactic, encouraging Harden to attack mismatches in isolation instead of running the typical Houston offense.

Either way, Game 6 should be a ton of fun.",fox-sports
9,Jimmie Rivera meets Thomas Almeida at FOX UFC Fight Night in New York | FOX Sports,"Two top ranked bantamweights will clash at the upcoming FOX UFC Fight Night card in New York when Jimmie Rivera meets Thomas Almeida on July 22 at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island.

The new fight was first announced via Newsday on Tuesday.

Rivera (20-1) has been flawless thus far in his UFC career with four consecutive wins including a victory over new UFC Hall of Fame inductee Urijah Faber this past September.

Rivera has been clamoring for a big fight as he continues his climb up the bantamweight rankings and now he’ll face one of the most dangerous threats the divison has to offer.

Almeida (22-1) has been one of the most thrilling fighters competing at 135 pounds since his arrival in the UFC nearly three years ago.

Most recently, Almeida dispatched Albert Morales in the second round, which marked his 17th career victory by way of knockout or TKO.

Almeida’s only setback in the UFC came to current bantamweight champion Cody Garbrandt, but now he’s ready to resume his course towards title contention as he faces a tough challenge in Rivera in July.

9,Dana White: 'There's going to be a point where I'm done' pursuing McGregor vs. Mayweather | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White committed to doing everything possible to land Conor McGregor a lucrative payday against Floyd Mayweather, but the fight is still no closer to reality.

On Saturday night after Saul “Canelo” Alvarez dished out a punishing decision in his fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., his next bout against Gennady Golovkin was announced for September 16.

That was the date originally reserved for the proposed matchup between McGregor and Mayweather, but White says he just wasn’t able to strike a deal with both sides in time so a different boxing match scooped up that Saturday on the schedule.

“The reason they got my date is because I couldn’t get my deal done on time so they got the date,” White told “The Herd” on Tuesday. “Listen, life moves on, we don’t wait for anybody. The fights are going to keep rolling. I didn’t get the deal done fast enough so I lose the date. That’s how it works.”

A date being targeted for the fight might make it appear that a deal is imminent but White says that couldn’t be further from the truth.

In fact, he says he’s no closer to closing the negotiations to put together the fight between McGregor and Mayweather and there will come a day when he is forced to give up if the two sides can’t reach an amicable agreement.

“I’m not hinting that it’s getting close at all. I knew that this thing was going to be a nightmare to get done if it can even be done. We’ll find out,” White said. “Obviously, both guys want to fight each other but what’s the deal. Can the deal be done? That’s the question.

“It’s not just Mayweather. It’s both sides of this thing are going to be hard to get done. Absolutely, there’s going to be a point where I’m done. This isn’t what I do, this isn’t my business and I’m definitely going to walk away.”

White can’t say for certain when that deadline will be reached where he’ll no longer participate in the negotiations, but he promises it could eventually happen.

As much as he wants to put the fight together for McGregor, who stands to potentially make up to nine-figures for the bout, White will eventually reach his breaking point.

“Either way, it doesn’t matter to me. I know that these two guys want to fight. I’ve said many times, I respect Conor and I’d like to do this fight for him but it’s got to be the right deal. We have to get the right deal done or it’s not going to happen,” White said. “Because at the end of the day, this isn’t what I do. The UFC is what I do and I should be focusing on that and not a boxing match.

“Obviously, a lot of people want to see it, there’s a lot of interest in it, but it’s not really what I do.”",fox-sports

9,UFC finally confirms women's flyweight division launching with 'Ultimate Fighter' 26 | FOX Sports,"Let’s try this one more time.

Last week the UFC announced and then retracted plans to launch a women’s flyweight division with season 26 on “The Ultimate Fighter” with filming expected to start in July.

Now the UFC has finally rolled out the plan — again — to kick off the 125-pound women’s division with the new season of the reality show where fighters from outside the UFC as well as competitors currently on the roster can try out for the season that will crown the first ever champion.

Tryouts will be held on May 23 at the Palace Station Hotel in Las Vegas. Fighters are required to be between the ages of 21-34 with at least three fights and a winning professional record.

The stutter step for the announcement didn’t slow down the excitement for several fighters already competing in the UFC, who have already expressed interest in moving to flyweight once the division opens.

Jessica Eye, who was previously ranked as the No. 1 fighter in the world at flyweight, has already told FOX Sports that if she wins her next bout on July 7 against Aspen Ladd that she plans to move down to 125 pounds.

Former “Ultimate Fighter” competitor Bec Rawlings has also mentioned a potential move to flyweight although it doesn’t appear she’s interested in competing during another season of the reality show after already doing that once previously in her career.

Lauren Murphy has stated that she plans on gunning for a spot on the reality show with an aim to become the first ever women’s flyweight champion in the UFC.

6,Behind the scenes of James Comey's epic firing,"Washington (CNN) A little past 5 p.m. on Tuesday, a black Ford Taurus slowed to a stop just outside FBI headquarters in Washington and dispatched a white-haired man in a dark suit.

He emerged from the car alone, a manila folder in his right hand, and walked slowly toward the agency's appointment gate. Passersby paid little notice.

But Keith Schiller, President Donald Trump's pugnacious former bodyguard who now sits sentry outside the Oval Office doors, was at the law enforcement agency armed with a bombshell message from his longtime boss to FBI Director James Comey: ""You are hereby terminated and removed from office.""

Schiller emerged from the building just short of an hour later, the manila folder gone. By then, the stunning intent of his visit to the FBI was known, and the ramifications of a sitting president firing the man investigating his campaign's ties to Russia were reverberating across Washington.

This account of the lead-up and the aftermath of Trump's decision is based on interviews with more than two dozen officials at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI and on Capitol Hill, nearly all of whom spoke anonymously to describe an extraordinarily sensitive moment for Trump and his presidency.

Backlash begins

Backlash was swift, with claims from Democrats that Trump was ridding himself of an investigator who was delving too deeply into ties between his associates and Russia. Even some Republicans, including the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said they were troubled by the development and its timing. Comparisons to Richard Nixon, who fired a special prosecutor probing the Watergate burglary, began flying.

The White House insisted the firing came amid questions about Comey's handing of a probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server. But that explanation was betrayed by Trump's letter, which didn't mention those concerns, focusing instead on the continuing inquiry into his campaign's Russia ties.

Officials in the West Wing, many of whom weren't aware Trump was planning to fire Comey, appeared caught off guard by the furor.

The collective recoil against the move prompted urgent meetings among Trump's aides to manage the fallout. Hours after telling reporters that the White House would have no additional comment beyond Trump's own words, top aides were marched to television cameras on the North Lawn to explain the decision.

One source familiar with the President's reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks. So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.

Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails.

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

""The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?""

JUST WATCHED Who is James Comey? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is James Comey? 01:05

Closely held decision

The idea of firing Comey was closely held within the West Wing, these officials say, where the few aides who were aware of Trump's intentions barely discussed the topic among themselves. Among those looped in: Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who began fine-tuning their rationale for removing Comey from his post shortly after learning of Trump's intentions.

On Tuesday, they had their explanation: Comey mishandled the investigation into Clinton's emails.

""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails,"" Rosenstein wrote in a letter that the White House released Tuesday. ""I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.""

By the time the memo was complete, Trump was already preparing to execute his decision. His schedule was almost entirely cleared on Monday and Tuesday except for meetings with his national security team. Nearly as soon as Comey's firing was announced, Trump was meeting in the Oval Office with Andrew McCabe, the FBI deputy director, to gauge the agency's No. 2 before elevating him to acting director following Comey's dismissal.

Meanwhile, back at FBI headquarters, news was quickly spreading that Comey was being ushered out. Instead of delivering Trump's letter to Comey in person, Schiller deposited the document at his office. Comey, in fact, wasn't at his agency's headquarters at all when Schiller arrived with the missive from the President; he was addressing agents at the FBI's Los Angeles field office when news came down that Trump had demanded his resignation.

Instead of learning from Trump's letter that he was being fired, Comey found out from television. TVs set to cable news inside the room he was speaking began airing reports of his demise midway through his speech. He made a joke about it to lighten the situation, phoned back to FBI headquarters, and received official confirmation that his tenure atop the law enforcement agency was over.

'I have no reason to believe ...'

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials speaking Tuesday said they were unaware that Trump was preparing to fire Comey, describing themselves afterward as shocked by the development.

Asked hours before announcing the decision whether Trump maintained confidence in Comey, Spicer avoided answered forthrightly.

""I have no reason to believe -- I haven't asked him,"" Spicer said. ""I have not asked the President since the last time we spoke about this.""

The decision came at an uneasy moment for the Justice Department, which has been at the center of controversy since Trump assumed office in January. Officials described tensions that have festered over the past several months between Justice Department leadership and senior staff at the FBI over the handling of the Clinton investigation and how Comey was running the agency, according to multiple officials.

Meanwhile, the White House and Sessions have pushed the FBI to pursue leaks of classified information to the media, according to one Justice Department official, urging the agency to prioritize the probe over other matters, including the investigation into Russian election meddling.

One Justice official suggested there could be more changes coming at the FBI beyond Comey's removal.

""There is a lot of cleaning house that needs to be done,"" one official said.

Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records, as part of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year's election, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before Trump fired Comey.

Shock and confusion

While a handful of top senators were given a heads-up by Trump, the overwhelming sentiment on Capitol Hill was one of shock and confusion.

In some GOP offices, there was an open question of how exactly to respond, with communications staffers reaching out to their colleagues to try and unify their initial draft statements. Without advance notice or guidance from the White House at the start, many offices were stuck in a holding pattern, according to several aides for Republican senators.

For several senators, including some on the Senate judiciary or intelligence committees that oversee the FBI, it was news alerts on their mobile phones or reporters in hallways who broke the news of Comey's removal.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, was presiding over the Senate when the news hit.

""Basically, the parliamentarian told me,"" Rubio told reporters as he walked off the Senate floor. ""I don't have any initial reaction because I don't have any information.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, never shy about expressing his views on an issue, emerged from another senator's office to tell reporters he would be withholding judgments until he had a better handle on what had just occurred.

Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a member of the intelligence committee, told reporters he was ""surprised"" by the firing, and wasn't given a heads-up by the White House.

For Senate Democrats, it was a more straightforward process. Within 20 minutes, statement after statement began rolling out of Democrats questioning Trump's motives -- and using the firing to try and spark new momentum for a special prosecutor or independent commission to look into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.

For members of the House, currently out on recess, it was a scramble by their top staffers to try and get in touch and even brief them on the news. Some lawmakers are out of the country. Others were just about to walk into town halls. Many senior staffers had already departed for the evening by the time the news broke.

6,James Comey's fall,"(CNN) James Comey came to the FBI with a hero's reputation: He famously stood up to President George W. Bush's aides in a dramatic hospital-room confrontation over secret wiretapping.

He had few enemies in Washington when he took the helm of the FBI on a 93-1 Senate vote in 2013.

But by the time President Donald Trump unceremoniously dumped him late Tuesday, Comey had few clear friends left in town -- with his reputation under siege. His critics on both the left and the right attacked his handling of probes into Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump's Russia ties , and more.

The sudden firing threw into doubt the independence of the FBI's ongoing Russia investigation and the stability of the bureau itself, which has been wracked by charges that Comey's political meddling in the fall campaign compromised its mission.

The Justice Department inspector general has been investigating Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation and other campaign controversies since last fall, but the rapid-fire events on Tuesday added a historic level of drama to a story that has gripped Washington for months.

Not since the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" at the height of the Watergate scandal has the delicate relationship between the White House and the FBI been thrown into such turmoil.

On that night in 1973, President Richard Nixon fired a series of top Justice Department officials after they refused to fire a special prosecutor who was investigating the Watergate abuses.

Democrats, who had savaged Comey for his handling of the Clinton email investigation, reversed course and portrayed him Tuesday not as a villain, but as a victim. They quickly cast the firing in Nixonian terms and accused Trump of trying to quash the ongoing Russia investigation.

Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called the firing ""brazen interference"" in the FBI's investigation.

Even Republican Senator Richard Burr, who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed concern over Comey's firing : ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" he said in a statement.

Comey said last week at a Senate hearing that he was pained and ""mildly nauseous"" over the thought that his actions might have affected the presidential election.

But he said he had no regrets, and he had shown no indication he thought his job was in jeopardy. He has even ticked off the exact number of days he had left until his 10-year term expired in 2023 -- a term he expected to complete.

The political attacks were a remarkable turn for the 6'8"" Comey, a towering and charismatic figure who had risen to power with seeming effortlessness earlier in his career.

As a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va. in the 1990s, Comey earned high marks for a novel program that saw long prison terms for felons who used guns in their crimes. He was then given the coveted job of US Attorney in Manhattan -- before President Bush tapped him to become the second-ranking official for the entire Justice Department.

In that post, Comey burnished his reputation as an honest broker willing to stand up to power -- even at the risk of his own job.

In 2004, when his boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis, Comey refused to sign off on a secret eavesdropping program approved by Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks because he believed it might be illegal.

Two of Bush's aides, Alberto Gonzales and Andy Card, raced to the hospital to try to get Ashcroft's bedside signature to continue the wiretapping program.

But Comey, with sirens blazing on his security detail's car, beat them there and raced up the stairs to his boss's hospital room, where Ashcroft stood by his underling's decision.

The episode became a part of the Comey lore when it was first revealed publicly more than a year later.

As director of the FBI, Comey spoke frequently and passionately about distancing the bureau from the dictatorial days of J. Edgar Hoover's 48-year reign.

On his desk at the FBI, he kept a copy of a letter from Hoover for the wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. -- a dark reminder, Comey said, of the bureau's abusive past.

With public opinion turning on him over the Clinton email investigation, however, Comey appeared to realize that he was becoming increasingly isolated after years of stardom.

At a memorial service for a prosecutor held at a packed Justice Department auditorium just days before the November election, Comey joked sardonically in a eulogy about how unpopular he seemed to have become in the eyes of some colleagues.

His own memorial service, he suggested, would no doubt be held in a much smaller venue.",cnn
6,Trump fires FBI director James Comey,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election.

The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.

The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.

In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal there would be no backlash.

What was not thought through apparently was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe.

In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was re-opening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency.

Comey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation.

The letters

In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,"" Trump told Comey in the letter. ""I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.""

White House press secretary Sean Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails.

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.

JUST WATCHED Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' 01:03

Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to ""usurp the attorney general's authority"" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution.

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein argued in his memo.

""We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),"" Rosenstein said. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

Congressional reaction

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President?"" Schumer asked

And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading an Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a ""loss for the bureau and the nation.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,"" Burr said.

As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed.

""I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general is competent to lead that effort,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership.

But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would ""raise questions.""

Sen. John McCain added: ""While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.""

The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations.

'Absurd'

CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was ""absurd.""

Toobin branded the move a ""grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.""

""This is not something that is within the American political tradition,"" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.

""This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,"" Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director.

The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25.

A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.

Team Clinton reaction

Former Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation.

""I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called ""charade"" only 24 hours ago,"" said Clinton's former campaign manager Robby Mook.

""It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,"" he said.

One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Scuitto.

""I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,"" the person said.

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials say they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they are shocked by the development.

Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President.

Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin ""forwarded hundreds and thousands"" of emails to her husband's laptop.

The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the ""hundreds and thousands of emails"" that Comey said were 'forwarded"" from Abedin to her husband's email ""included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.""

The White House said it will immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions.

Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world.

In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did.

But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election, put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight.

Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being ""extremely careless"" with sensitive information.

Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the ""political"" decision.

Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had re-opened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges.

After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part.

Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: ""I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.""

After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.

He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief.

""Oh, here's Jim,"" Trump said in January. ""He's become more famous than me.""",cnn
6,Trump's letter firing FBI Director James Comey,"(CNN) President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017. Here are White House press secretary Sean Spicer's announcement, the letter to Comey from Trump, the letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the memo from the deputy attorney general.",cnn
6,Behind the scenes of James Comey's epic firing,"Washington (CNN) A little past 5 p.m. on Tuesday, a black Ford Taurus slowed to a stop just outside FBI headquarters in Washington and dispatched a white-haired man in a dark suit.

He emerged from the car alone, a manila folder in his right hand, and walked slowly toward the agency's appointment gate. Passersby paid little notice.

But Keith Schiller, President Donald Trump's pugnacious former bodyguard who now sits sentry outside the Oval Office doors, was at the law enforcement agency armed with a bombshell message from his longtime boss to FBI Director James Comey: ""You are hereby terminated and removed from office.""

Schiller emerged from the building just short of an hour later, the manila folder gone. By then, the stunning intent of his visit to the FBI was known, and the ramifications of a sitting president firing the man investigating his campaign's ties to Russia were reverberating across Washington.

This account of the lead-up and the aftermath of Trump's decision is based on interviews with more than two dozen officials at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI and on Capitol Hill, nearly all of whom spoke anonymously to describe an extraordinarily sensitive moment for Trump and his presidency.

Backlash begins

Backlash was swift, with claims from Democrats that Trump was ridding himself of an investigator who was delving too deeply into ties between his associates and Russia. Even some Republicans, including the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said they were troubled by the development and its timing. Comparisons to Richard Nixon, who fired a special prosecutor probing the Watergate burglary, began flying.

The White House insisted the firing came amid questions about Comey's handing of a probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server. But that explanation was betrayed by Trump's letter, which didn't mention those concerns, focusing instead on the continuing inquiry into his campaign's Russia ties.

Officials in the West Wing, many of whom weren't aware Trump was planning to fire Comey, appeared caught off guard by the furor.

The collective recoil against the move prompted urgent meetings among Trump's aides to manage the fallout. Hours after telling reporters that the White House would have no additional comment beyond Trump's own words, top aides were marched to television cameras on the North Lawn to explain the decision.

One source familiar with the President's reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks. So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.

Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails.

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

Closely held decision

The idea of firing Comey was closely held within the West Wing, these officials say, where the few aides who were aware of Trump's intentions barely discussed the topic among themselves. Among those looped in: Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who began fine-tuning their rationale for removing Comey from his post shortly after learning of Trump's intentions.

On Tuesday, they had their explanation: Comey mishandled the investigation into Clinton's emails.

""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails,"" Rosenstein wrote in a letter that the White House released Tuesday. ""I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.""

By the time the memo was complete, Trump was already preparing to execute his decision. His schedule was almost entirely cleared on Monday and Tuesday except for meetings with his national security team. Nearly as soon as Comey's firing was announced, Trump was meeting in the Oval Office with Andrew McCabe, the FBI deputy director, to gauge the agency's No. 2 before elevating him to acting director following Comey's dismissal.

Meanwhile, back at FBI headquarters, news was quickly spreading that Comey was being ushered out. Instead of delivering Trump's letter to Comey in person, Schiller deposited the document at his office. Comey, in fact, wasn't at his agency's headquarters at all when Schiller arrived with the missive from the President; he was addressing agents at the FBI's Los Angeles field office when news came down that Trump had demanded his resignation.

Instead of learning from Trump's letter that he was being fired, Comey found out from television. TVs set to cable news inside the room he was speaking began airing reports of his demise midway through his speech. He made a joke about it to lighten the situation, phoned back to FBI headquarters, and received official confirmation that his tenure atop the law enforcement agency was over.

Trump critics call for appointment of special prosecutor to investigate alleged dealings between Trump campaign and Russia

(CNN) The ""Saturday Night Massacre"" was one of the most dramatic turns of events in the Watergate scandal -- the political drama that rocked the United States in the 1970s and led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

President Nixon and the Attorney General's office were locked in a political standoff over Nixon's refusal to comply with orders to release recordings of White House conversations.

Richard Nixon, left, and Archibald Cox, right.

Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. But Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than comply with the order. Cox was eventually fired by the US solicitor general.

Critics of President Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey see similiarities between Cox's firing decades ago and Trump's action on Tuesday.

The Trump administration, critics say, is trying to undermine the FBI's investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, just as Nixon tried to stop lawmakers from learning the truth about his role in the Watergate scandal.

3,FBI chief James Comey fired by Trump,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year

President Donald Trump has fired the director of the FBI over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails, the administration says.

The White House shocked Washington by announcing that James Comey ""has been terminated and removed from office"".

But Democrats said he was fired because the FBI was investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The move came as it emerged Mr Comey gave inaccurate information about Mrs Clinton's emails to Congress last week.

President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that ""you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau"".

Mr Sessions said the Department of Justice was ""committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law"", and ""a fresh start is needed"".

The White House said the search for a successor would begin immediately.

Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when he was handed a note by one of his team informing him he had just been fired.

The 56-year-old - who was four years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank.

Why does the administration say Comey was fired?

Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the Clinton emails investigation, given that Mr Trump once praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.

In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump told a rally it ""took guts"" for Mr Comey to reopen the inquiry. ""What he did brought back his reputation,"" Mr Trump said.

But on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he ""cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken"".

""Almost everyone agrees the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.""

He said Mr Comey had been wrong to ""usurp"" the previous attorney general in July 2016 to announce the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution.

The deputy attorney general said Mr Comey compounded his error by ""gratuitously"" releasing ""derogatory information"" about Mrs Clinton.

What about the Russia investigation?

Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.

The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are looking into the same allegations.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference.

""This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" he added.

Mr Trump retorted on Twitter: ""Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, 'I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer.' Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp"".

The firing is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when President Richard Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.

But President Trump has repeatedly insisted the Russia allegations are ""fake news"".

What are Republicans saying?

Richard Burr, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Jim Comey's termination.""

Justin Amash, a conservative Michigan congressman, said he was considering a plan to set up an independent commission on Russia.

Mr Amash described as ""bizarre"" a paragraph of Mr Trump's letter to Mr Comey - in which he says the FBI director informed the president on three occasions he was not under investigation.

Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, a longstanding Trump critic, said the ""timing of the firing is very troubling"".

A cover-up? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump and senior Justice Department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support.

Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree. The president didn't help his cause by specifically asserting that he was ""not under investigation"" in his letter to Mr Comey.

Already Democrats are clamouring for the ex-director to testify before Congress about the state of the FBI's Russia investigation at the time of his dismissal.

Just days after becoming president, Mr Trump shook Mr Comey's hand at a White House event and said ""he's become more famous than me"". That may have been an exaggeration at the time.

It seems less like one now.

How did Comey handle the email inquiry?

Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.

The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.

He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.

He told the Senate last week it made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again.

Mrs Clinton blames Mr Comey for her shock election defeat last November to Donald Trump.

Mr Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails, ""some of which contain classified information"", to her then-husband.

But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had only sent two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing.

The clarification was made in a letter from the FBI's assistant director of congressional affairs, Gregory Brower, to the congressional committee.

The majority of the 49,000 emails investigators uncovered on Mr Weiner's laptop were transferred via automatic backup from her work Blackberry device, Mr Brower wrote.

Ultimately, all 12 classified email chains found on Mr Weiner's device were duplicates that had already been reviewed by investigators.",bbc-news
6,General election 2017: Labour and Lib Dems pledge school cash,"Image copyright PA

Labour and the Lib Dems are both making multibillion pound funding pledges to tackle school cash shortages in England.

Labour says it would raise corporation tax to spend £4.8bn on keeping up with rising costs, and £335m so no schools lost out from a funding reorganisation.

The Lib Dems are promising £7bn to protect per-pupil funding levels.

The Conservatives said school spending had reached record levels and attacked the two parties' spending plans.

Headteachers have been warning about job losses caused by cash shortages, with the National Audit Office estimating schools will have to cut £3bn from budgets by 2019-20 to meet rising cost pressures.

A new funding formula will also see some schools lose money, although others will gain.

On Monday, the Institute of Fiscal Studies said protecting schools from real-terms cuts in England would mean spending the equivalent of an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner are promising a real-terms funding increase in schools and ""free lifelong education"" in colleges, including restoring the Educational Maintenance Allowance.

This would be paid for by increasing corporation tax from the current 19% to 26% by 2021, Labour said.

""We will invest in schools and in our young people, ensuring no primary pupils go hungry during the day, reducing class sizes so children can learn and teachers can teach, and restoring the maintenance allowance and grants for students in both further and higher education,"" Ms Rayner said.

The Lib Dems claimed their plans went further than Labour's and said details of how they would funded would be provided ""in due course"" in the party's manifesto.

The party said it would also protect further education per-pupil funding in real terms.

'Made-up promises'

Lib Dem education spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: ""While funding per pupil is set to see the biggest cuts in a generation, billions of pounds are being spent on divisive plans to expand grammars and free schools.

""This extra £7bn of funding would ensure no school and no child loses out.""

The Conservatives said Labour had already committed the corporation tax rise to other projects.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said Labour's announcement was ""just made-up promises on the back of nonsensical spending plans"".

He added: ""The Lib Dems are no better and won't even tell people about the tax rises they would bring in.""

BBC education editor Branwen Jeffreys says schools in England have been experiencing a financial squeeze for the first time in 20 years, and plans for the different funding formula have galvanised lobbying by headteachers and parents.

As education is a devolved matter, the pledges relate to England only, and the amount Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receives would be determined by the funding formula.",bbc-news
6,Conservative election expenses charging decision due,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The way the Conservatives' ""battle bus"" spending was recorded is being investigated

Prosecutors are expected to announce on Wednesday whether Conservative politicians or officials will face charges for breaches of expenses rules.

The CPS is considering files sent by police following investigations in up to 27 constituencies.

It relates to claims some campaigning costs in the 2015 general election were wrongly recorded.

The Conservative Party has insisted administrative errors were to blame rather than any intention to deceive.

And it has said some of the spending was correctly declared.

Complex rules

It is alleged the Conservatives spent tens of thousands of pounds on local campaigns - including on ""battle bus"" visits by activists - which were either not declared or were wrongly registered as national spending.

The allegations came to light following an investigation by Channel 4 News.

Under complex election spending rules, parties must disclose national spending separately from money used to promote each candidate, and separate national and local limits apply.

Up to 16 police forces across England have submitted files to be considered by prosecutors.

The CPS will consider whether there is sufficient evidence of a breach in the law, and whether a prosecution is ""in the public interest"".

If general election candidates are prosecuted the Conservative Party will have to decide whether to suspend them and replace them as nominees.

The last date for candidates to register for the election is 11 May.

3,Australian politician becomes first to breastfeed in parliament,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Australian Senator Larissa Waters with her daughter, Alia Joy

Australian Senator Larissa Waters has become the first politician to breastfeed in the nation's parliament.

Ms Waters, from the left-wing Greens party, fed two-month-old daughter Alia Joy during a vote on Tuesday.

The lower house last year joined the Senate in allowing breastfeeding, but no MPs in either house had done so.

It followed a backlash in 2015 when Kelly O'Dwyer, a government minister, was asked to consider expressing milk to avoid missing parliamentary duties.

""We need more women and parents in Parliament,"" Ms Waters said on Facebook.

""And we need more family-friendly and flexible workplaces, and affordable child care, for everyone.""

Flexibility urged

Labor Senator Katy Gallagher said the moment deserved to be acknowledged.

""Women have been doing it in parliaments around the world,"" she told Sky News Australia.

""Women are going to continue to have babies and if they want to do their job and be at work and look after their baby... the reality is we are going to have to accommodate that.""

Until last year, MPs in the lower House of Representatives could take babies only into parliamentary offices or public galleries.

Politicians have been permitted to breastfeed in the Senate since 2003.

The subject is a sensitive issue in many parliaments around the world. In 2016, Spanish MP Carolina Bescansa, from the Podemos (We Can) party, was both criticised and commended for by taking her baby into parliament and breastfeeding him.

Last year, a report on diversity in UK politics recommended that allowing breastfeeding in the House of Commons should be considered.

However, one MP in 2015 warned it could risk ridicule from the tabloid press.",bbc-news

The newly elected president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, has been sworn in after a decisive election victory.

He said he would be willing to visit Pyongyang ""in the right circumstances"".

The 64-year-old human rights lawyer, known for his liberal views, wants to increase contact with North Korea in a departure from current policy.

He has also vowed to unify a divided country reeling from a corruption scandal which saw his predecessor impeached, and improve the economy.

Mr Moon was sworn in as South Korea's 19th president at the National Assembly building in Seoul, filling a leadership vacuum in the wake of Park Geun-hye's removal.

The Democratic Party candidate has positioned himself as the man who can move the country on from the scandal, and has pledged to build ""a just, united country"".

He has also been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development, and has promised to bolster the economy and address youth unemployment, key concerns for voters.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said their countries faced common challenges ""led by responses to the North Korean issue"" but they could ""further contribute to peace and prosperity of the region by working together"".

President Xi Jinping said he ""always attaches great importance to the relationship between China and South Korea"", and that he was ""willing to diligently work with"" with Mr Moon to ensure both countries benefit, reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua.

3,Syria war: US to arm Kurds in battle for Raqqa,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption US special forces have been supporting SDF units on the ground

US President Donald Trump has approved supplying weapons to Kurdish forces fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria, the Pentagon says.

Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would be equipped to help drive IS from its stronghold, Raqqa, a spokeswoman said.

The US was ""keenly aware"" of Turkey's concerns about such a move, she added.

Turkey views the Kurdish rebels as terrorists and wants to stop them taking more territory in Syria.

The Pentagon later said US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had spoken by phone to his Turkish counterpart, Fikri Isik, but gave no details of the conversation. Turkish officials have not yet responded publicly.

SDF forces, which comprise Kurdish and Arab militias, are already being supported by elite US forces and air strikes from a US-led coalition.

The US has previously supplied light weapons and armoured vehicles to the Arab element of the SDF, known as the Syrian Arab Coalition.

The SDF is currently battling IS for control of the city of Tabqa, an IS command centre just 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa.

The Kurdish fighters are from the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades.

Last month, Turkey carried out air strikes on YPG positions in Syria which it described as ""terrorist havens"".

Analysis: Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington

The US believes the Kurdish fighters will be essential to Raqqa's downfall.

The Pentagon sees them as the most disciplined and organised of the anti-IS groups but Turkish opposition has meant Washington has had to tread a fine line.

The imminence of the fight for the city means delay is no longer an option and the Kurds will be getting a range of equipment.

US sources say they have received assurances from the Kurds that they will leave Raqqa to be governed by Syrian Arabs after the battle.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is due in Washington next week - he will not be a happy visitor.

A Pentagon source told the BBC the equipment would include ammunition, small arms, machine guns, heavy machine guns, construction equipment such as bulldozers and armoured vehicles.

The source added that the US would ""seek to recover"" the equipment afterwards.

No timeline has been given for when the weapons would start to be supplied.

""We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey,"" said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, who is travelling with Mr Mattis in Lithuania.

""We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the US is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our Nato ally.""

3,Venezuela sees sharp rise in infant and maternal mortality,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Health care workers protested in February in Caracas against President Nicolas Maduro's government, the lack of medicines and low salaries

There has been a sharp rise in infant mortality and maternal death rates in Venezuela.

In the first figures released for two years, the Health Ministry said the number of women dying in childbirth was up by 65%, while child deaths were up 30%.

There has also been a jump in illnesses such as malaria and diphtheria.

The figures reflect the country's deep economic crisis which the opposition says the government has mismanaged.

President Nicolas Maduro says the health crisis is caused by medicines being hoarded to encourage a coup against him.

The country has the largest oil reserves in the world but the collapse of oil prices a few years ago led to a recession and a shortage of the foreign currency needed to import equipment, food and medicines.

Venezuelans face shortages of everything from food to vaccines.

Sorry state of hospitals

UN to supply medicines?

In a recent survey, three-quarters of Venezuelans say their health has plummeted, and that they are eating less than two meals a day. Many report losing an average of around 9 kilos (19 pounds).

In the health sector, large numbers of doctors have emigrated. A leading pharmaceutical association has said around 85% of medicines are in short supply.

Speaking to the Reuters news agency, a critic of the government's health policies, Dr Julio Castro, an infectious disease specialist said:

""The striking part is the turmoil in almost all categories that this bulletin addresses, with particularly significant increased in the infant and maternal health categories.""

Many Venezuelans have trekked to the border with Brazil or Colombia to buy medicine there and seek treatment in public hospitals in neighbouring countries.

In Brazil, the state of Roraima declared a state of emergency to deal with thousands of Venezuelans seeking treatment by the public health service in small border towns.

It is not clear why Venezuela's Health Ministry published its figures now. It had stopped releasing figures after July 2015.

The country has been paralysed for over a month by almost-daily increasingly violent demonstrations against the government of Nicolas Maduro with protestors calling for elections.",bbc-news
10,Microsoft Build 2017: what to expect in major Windows 10 news,"Moved temporarily a few months back and physically a few hundred miles north compared to last year, Microsoft’s Build 2017 developer conference is nearly underway.

With the first keynote set to start on May 10 at 8am PT (11am ET / 4pm BST / 1am May 11 AEST) from Seattle, Washington, Microsoft has plenty to chat about this year despite holding a major media event just last week to tout Windows 10 S and the Surface Laptop.

The most notable topics we expect to see detailed are Redstone 3, the codename for Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update, Project Neon, Microsoft’s visual makeover-in-progress for the operating system (OS), Cortana and even more mixed reality advancements.

With that, here is everything we can bank on seeing during the Build 2017 keynotes starting May 10.

Redstone 3 gets unearthed

Microsoft’s Windows Insider Program members are, technically, already testing out Redstone 3 as you read this. We know this because features that were originally slated for Redstone 2, i.e. the Creators Update, but missed the deadline are now in testing through the latest Insider Preview build of Windows 10 (as of this writing): Build 16188.

Chief among those features left on the Creators Update cutting room floor is My People, a feature that brings your favorite contacts directly into the Windows 10 taskbar for easier file sharing and messaging. Expect to see more of this discussed on stage this week.

Other major expected features to be detailed are PDF editing features in Microsoft Edge (already in the latest Insider Preview build), Power Throttling to reduce apps’ power draw on laptops and tablet PCs and further improvements to more transparent automated OS updates.

We also wouldn’t be surprised to see Redstone 3 get its official name and, at the very least, a release window (if not a hard date) since Microsoft has promised two major updates annually.

Cortana branches out

That Harman Kardon unveiled its Invoke speaker powered by Microsoft’s Cortana just days before Build 2017 is no coincidence. With the long-rumored rival to Amazon Echo and Google Home now out in the open, expect Microsoft to spend some considerable time on this initiative.

In fact, controls for Cortana-powered speakers were already found within the earliest Insider Preview builds for Redstone 3. On that note, expect to hear a lot more about how far the Amazon Alexa-like Cortana Skills and device software developer kits have come since their announcement last year.

However, we find it hard to believe that Microsoft will sit on these tools until Redstone 3 becomes a fancy-named update that hits every Windows 10 device. After all, don’t expect Amazon and Google – or even the rumored Apple Siri Speaker – to slow down over the next five months.

Project Neon ... or Aero Glass 2.0

Microsoft’s fateful fall update should see the oft-teased visual overhaul to the Windows 10 interface known currently as Project Neon.

In short, the new visuals bring back a lot of the translucent design elements found in the Aero Glass design ID that started in Windows Vista and were found throughout Windows 7 before being dropped for Windows 8.

Furthermore, Project Neon markedly changes how Windows 10 animations in transitioning between apps look and feel. That said, early previews have stated that Neon is aiming for a simple aesthetic, so we’ll see how Microsoft achieves that balance with new animations in the mix.

Mixed reality gets a huge push

Unless Microsoft plans to give them a spotlight during its May 23 Surface event, Build 2017 would be the place to show even more of its partners’ head-mounted displays (HMDs).

Having already shown off Acer’s HMD at length during the Taiwanese firm’s annual New York hardware showcase, it’d be surprising not to see already-teased partners like Lenovo, Dell and HP not take the chance to get the word out regarding their Windows 10 Holographic devices.

Bonus round: maybe we’ll finally hear about price regarding any of Microsoft’s partners’ HMD devices. It’s a crucial point going into the holiday season, especially when it’s highly unlikely that either HTC or Facebook have 2017 hardware that can match that $299 starting price.",techradar
10,Amazon Echo Show launched: everything you need to know,"Amazon has finally announced the Amazon Echo Show, the first Echo device equipped with a screen.

The Show follows in the footsteps of the recently announced Amazon Echo Look, which combined Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with a camera that can take pictures and offer style recommendations.

The Show is a radical departure from previous Echo devices as it can provide you with information visually (via its screen) as well as through sound; previous speakers were limited to using voice to communicate.

Cut to the chase

What is it? The newest entry in Amazon's voice-activated line of Echo products

The newest entry in Amazon's voice-activated line of Echo products How much will it cost? $230 (rumored to be £220 in the UK, and AU price tba)

$230 (rumored to be £220 in the UK, and AU price tba) When is it out? June 28 and up for pre-order now on Amazon US with no official UK or AU release date yet announced

Amazon Echo Show release date

Confirming what was rumored earlier today due to a leak, Amazon has announced that the Amazon Echo Show will be released on June 28 in both the US and UK, with pre-orders open now in the US.

That means you'll have to wait a month and a half to get your hands on the new speaker if you order it today in the US.

Although the device is rumored to be coming to the UK simultaneously with the US, no official announcement about UK availability has yet been made.

Since Australia is still yet to receive the Amazon Echo, we're not holding our collective breath for the Echo Show to make its way there anytime soon.

Amazon Echo Show features

As well as the Alexa voice assistant, which we've become familiar with thanks to its inclusion in existing Amazon Echo speakers and Amazon Fire TV devices, the Amazon Echo Show is equipped with both a screen and a webcam, which will allow it to both show you, as well as tell you, information.

The screen is seven inches in size, and is touchscreen-enabled. It's capable of showing notifications, playing internet video, and showing lyrics on Amazon Music, among other things, and it can also facilitate conversations between different devices in the same house.

It'll be interesting to see whether this functionality is expanded in the future to enable the Show to make voice calls outside of the home, as a pre-announcement leak from the WSJ suggested.

The screen can also be configured to show a live video feed from elsewhere in the house through compatible third-party security cameras.

In addition to the screen, the Amazon Echo Show is also equipped with a camera, as is the recently announced Amazon Echo Look. Amazon is pitching the Look as a style accessory, which will, for example, analyse your clothes in order to offer outfit suggestions.

This functionality will presumably also be making its way to the new Amazon Echo Show, although this is yet to be confirmed.

The Show is available in black or white color options.

As well as this new screen and camera functionality, the Show is compatible with Amazon's existing library of skills, which range from ordering cabs with Uber to controlling smart lightbulbs and thermostats, although existing skills will be audio-only until they're made Show-compatible.

The Show is equipped with eight microphones, which is one more than the existing Amazon Echo speaker. Given that the existing Echo is already pretty good at picking up our voice we're unsure why an extra microphone is needed, but it's a nice inclusion all the same.

Finally, the new device is equipped with Bluetooth, so even if your music app of choice isn't supported natively (such as Apple Music), you can still stream it to the Echo Show.

Pre-announcement leaks

We first heard rumors of the Amazon Echo Show a couple of months ago when Cnet reported that Amazon was planning on announcing a screen-equipped Echo device.

That report claimed the device, which we now know to be the Amazon Echo Show, was planned for later in the year, but its release was pushed forward after fears that Google Home was progressing more quickly than expected.

Then, just a few days ago, AFTVnews discovered a low-resolution image of the new device, codenamed the Echo 'Knight', on Amazon's servers. When it posted the discovery on Twitter, journalist Evan Blass responded with a much higher-resolution version of the same image.

@AFTVnews Here, let me help you with that. pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5, 2017

This week saw the leak of an announcement date of May 9, followed by a further leak of the price, release date, and name.

Between all of these leaks we've built up a pretty good idea of what the new device should be capable of, and most of the leaks have now been confirmed by the official announcement.",techradar
10,Here's what the OS that could replace* Android and Chrome OS looks like,"Fuchsia, the mysterious new operating system from Google, has taken another step forward, lifting the veil on its user interface.

Screenshots have surfaced showing Fuchsia's UI so far, giving users and programmers alike their first real glance at Google's new OS, as reported by Ars Technica.

Unlike Chrome OS and Android, which are built on Linux kernel, Fuchsia is based on a Google-made microkernel called Magenta. According to Google programmers, Magenta's focus is on ""modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors.""

Though it's currently just speculation, it's possible that Fuchsia could be the beginning of a new software standard for Google-made products. The search giant is rumored to be trimming the edges on its operating systems, as seen by it bridging some apps between Android and Chrome OS last year.

As for Fuchsia, the new OS uses a current default system UI called Armadillo to build its layout and manage widgets. You can see how it compares visually to its Google-made kin in the images below:

Image 1 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 2 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 3 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica)

From first glance, Fuchsia maintains similar notes to Chrome OS and Android, such as clear-cut widgets and a colorful palette for windows on apps and notifications. Also noticeable are entire sections of the interface dedicated to Google's search functions and suggested content.

However, you can get a better idea what sets Fuchsia apart when it's in motion, a such as in the video below, courtesy of Kyle Bradshaw of Hotfix.net:

To be clear, Google hasn't stated any plans to actively replace Android or Chrome OS at this time, nor has it given a timeframe for when we might see its experimental new OS make its way to consumer products (if at all.)

That said, as we near ever closer to the Google IO 2017 conference next week, we might be lucky enough to learn more about what the tech giant has planned for its latest creation. In the meantime, the open-source files are available via GitHub for any crafty coders looking to dive into Fuchsia for themselves.

10,Has Meizu's quick charge tech reinvented the smartphone?,"Do you carry a portable charger for your smartphone? They seem innocent enough, but those small black boxes are like a sticking plaster over the tech industry's gaping wound; pathetic phone batteries not fit for the modern mobile age.

It's not just the Pokémon Go app that drains the life from smartphones, with navigation apps like Google Maps, firmware updates, and even just the camera app eating away at battery life at a worrying rate.

So could a claim by Chinese phone maker Meizu that it now has the technology to recharge a phone in less than 20 minutes change everything?

Super mCharge is expected to be used in phones inside two years. © Jamie Carter

Short battery life is a huge problem for the phone industry, whose minor improvements in power efficiency have been swallowed up by the ever-increasing size of smartphone screens.

""Smartphones have become more power-hungry, and battery life and charging technology has failed to keep pace, leaving users often unsatisfied with the battery life of their devices,"" says James Manning Smith, Information Analyst at Futuresource Consulting.

He points out that manufacturers have three choices when designing a phone; larger batteries in devices, more efficient components, and making charging more convenient for users.

Meizu has taken the middle road with its Super mCharge technology, which it unveiled at a press event at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona. The live demo saw an empty smartphone fill-up in precisely 18 minutes and 55 seconds.

Not exactly a riveting watch for onlookers, but impressive nonetheless. After over a year of R&D, said Meizu, it had improved the power of a Super mCharge battery to 55W, and accelerated charging speed by 5.5 times.

© Jamie Carter

An industry first

That 55W figure is key. “Meizu's 55W charging is a first for the mobile industry,” says Manning Smith, who confirms that it's a more powerful charging solution than anything already on the market.

“Standard USB charging is 5W, while some OEMs have released phones with 15-18W charging, such as Motorola, Samsung and Oppo.”

The battery inside the Meizu demo phone was 3,000mAh, which is a typical size for a smartphone (for comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8 uses a 3,000mAh battery, while the iPhone 7 claims a 1,960mAh battery), though this one was specially designed by Meizu's engineers to bear more than four times the current so it could work with Super mCharge.

So what has Meizu actually achieved here? As well as taking charging to 55W, Meizu has dramatically accelerated the charging speed.

Technically speaking, Super mCharge uses charge pump technology; comprising two groups of circuits, the charge pump exports half of the voltage after transformation and improves efficiency by 8%.

""Our solution yields 98% efficiency, compared with other companies who struggle to hit 90%,"" claims Meizu.

Super mCharge also uses a USB cable that's been redesigned to carry up to 160W of power, and as a result it does cost three times more than a regular USB cable.

Can the Meizu phone stand the heat?

There are two immediate concerns. Firstly, does fast charging mean the battery won't last very long? Secondly, is all that extra heat generated safe? After all, exploding batteries in smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 have made us all nervous.

On the first question, Meizu insists that in tests its 3,000mAh battery retained more than 80 percent of its capacity after 800 charge and discharge cycles, so it should be good for two years' normal use.

On the second concern about safety, Meizu claims that its optimization algorithm means the highest temperature the battery reaches is 39°C/102°F (in an ambient temperature of 22°C/72°F), just a bit higher than body temperature.

Manning Smith explains that since smartphones are very condensed devices, engineering restrictions mean the heat that builds up during high-powered charging can damage the battery, and other components in the phone.

""Meizu has developed a technology that allows the battery to be charged at a very high rate, without exceeding dangerous temperature levels,"" he adds.

Quick Charge 4.0 features on the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. © Jamie Carter

This is all impressive stuff, but only if the device can live up to Meizu's promises. ""Once the technology comes to market, it has the potential to set a new standard for wired smartphone charging,"" says Manning Smith.

That should happen during 2019 or 2020, but there's no guaranteed success for Super mCharge. Not only are several other similar innovations expected in that time-frame, but the general trend towards super-fast wired charging for phones looks set to be overtaken by the wireless charging era.

When it comes to super-fast wired charging, Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 (QC3.0) for Android devices is the current front-runner, with QC4.0 just announced for new flagship Android phones that use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset – and that includes the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, ZTE Gigabit and some versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8.

QC4.0 claims to charge 20% faster than QC3.0 (which charges an empty phone to 50% in about 30 minutes). That's not as impressive as Super mCharge's promised speeds, but then again it's available already.

Can Meizu's technology compete with wireless pads?

""Wireless charging companies are trying to [create] a world in which charging cables are unnecessary,"" says Manning Smith, who admits that support for wireless charging pads in wider society is in its infancy.

However, Aircharge has been installing wireless charging stations in restaurants, airports and hotels, while IKEA is including wireless charging pads in some furniture.

""Should we see an increase in the availability of wireless charging outlets in our daily lives, there may be less need for fast charging technologies,"" Manning Smith says.

There are also efforts to develop high-wattage wireless charging. Bosch has wireless charging for power tools that it plans to take up to 60W and use in all kinds of mobile devices by 2020, which would surpass Meizu's achievement – while LG has been developing wireless charging pads that bring a fully discharged phone up to 50% in 30 minutes, (so on a par with QC3.0).

“The convenience of cable-free, little-and-often charges that wireless charging can provide may be more convincing for consumers than wired, but quick charging,” says Manning Smith.

So while Meizu's Super mCharge is an exciting achievement, the future belongs not to electrochemical cells, but wireless charging pads – probably starting with your car.",techradar
6,Analysis: James Comey's firing won't end election controversy over Russia,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The White House reports Comey's dismissal comes after he was found in the middle of several political controversies like Russia's possible election interference and Hillary Clinton's handling of classified e-mails. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Just last week, President Trump was on Twitter accusing FBI Director James Comey of being too soft on his election opponent, Hillary Clinton.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!"" Trump tweeted May 2.

A week later, Trump sacked Comey — but for the exact opposite reason. Moments after announcing Comey's firing, the White House released a Justice Department letter that claimed Comey had inappropriately disparaged Clinton during the election campaign — and overstepped his bounds in publicly disclosing that he had reopened his investigation into the former secretary of State's emails.

Only Trump knows the real reason for Comey's firing.

But in his letter to Comey informing him of his dismissal, Trump issued what appeared a Shakespearean protestation: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump wrote to Comey on Tuesday.

Indeed, Comey was leading what appeared to be an open-ended investigation into Russian interference in the election — and what Trump associates knew about it. ""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?"" Trump tweeted Monday.

But Comey's firing will have the immediate effect of intensifying calls for an independent investigation to probe that very question.

After all, Comey was thrust into the role of refereeing the 2016 election because political appointees in the Obama and Trump administrations had been seen as incapable of doing so.

Former attorney general Loretta Lynch was forced to recuse herself from the Clinton probe after an ill-considered meeting with former president Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix in the midst of the investigation into his wife's emails.

Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama holdover, was fired 10 days into the Trump administration — four days after she warned the White House that Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was susceptible to Russian blackmail.

And Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, also had to recuse himself after misleading Congress about his own contacts with the Russian government while he served as a high-profile supporter of Trump's campaign.

So the political maelstrom Comey found himself in wasn't entirely of his own making. Still, Comey did not shun the spotlight that came with those politically sensitive investigations, holding unusually expository press conferences and giving freewheeling congressional testimony.

If there were any doubt that Comey was a pivotal figure in the 2016 presidential election, his firing as FBI director Tuesday should settle the issue for the history books.

It's a history that is still being written.

WASHINGTON – James Comey was supposed to have at least six more years in his term as FBI director.

Now that he’s been abruptly fired by President Trump, the White House has launched a search to replace him.

Who could take his place? Neither the FBI nor Justice Department would provide any leads. But there could be some clues.

Four years ago, when then-President Barack Obama selected Comey to succeed Robert Mueller, his name came from a list of potential candidates who may now have a new chance at the office.

The most-discussed names in that pool included some of most familiar names in national law enforcement, along with a former member of Congress.

Before Comey’s selection was announced in 2013, former Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, was the favorite of the FBI Agents Association, a group of 13,000 current and former agents.

""Chairman Rogers exemplifies the principles that should be possessed by the next FBI director,"" then-FBIAA President Konrad Motyka said at the time, announcing the association's support for Rogers. ""His unique and diverse experience as a veteran FBI agent and member of Congress will allow him to effectively lead the men and women of the bureau as they continue their work to protect our country from criminal and terrorist threats.""

Ken Wainstein, a former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, was another favorite.

Earlier this week, Wainstein made a public appearance, even though he stayed off to the sidelines. He served as counsel to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during a Monday appearance before a Senate subcommittee exploring Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Previously, he served as the FBI's general counsel and Mueller's chief of staff at the bureau.

At the Justice Department, Wainstein also once served as the chief federal prosecutor in D.C., and the director of the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, where he oversaw the operations of 94 federal prosecutors' offices in the U.S.

Another potential pick: John Pistole. Before his appointment as president of Anderson University in Indiana three years ago, the former deputy director of the FBI, had won notice for his steady direction of the Transportation Security Administration.

Pistole also is a close friend of Comey who attended the former TSA director's induction as Anderson University president.

Some current and former FBI agents also have pointed to Michael Mason, a former executive assistant FBI director, as a candidate for the top job.

Before leaving the bureau, Mason oversaw criminal and cyber investigations, coordinated international operations and the bureau's crisis response operations.

Two former New York officials were also linked to previous discussions about top jobs at the bureau and the Justice Department: former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

Giuliani, a high-profile surrogate for the Trump campaign, had been considered for a number of positions in the new administration, including attorney general and secretary of State. Meanwhile, Kelly is an executive at a private security firm.

As the search continues, the FBI is being headed by Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

But McCabe, who helped oversee the bureau's contentious investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, also has drawn heat.

McCabe's wife, a candidate for state office in Virginia, was the recipient of nearly $500,000 raised by an organization linked to Clinton ally and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The FBI claimed that the deputy director played no role in the campaign.

What does it say about your presidency when Richard Nixon's presidential library is mocking you?

""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian,"" the library tweeted Tuesday within a couple hours of the announcement of President Trump firing FBI Director James Comey.

FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector#notNixonianpic.twitter.com/PatArKOZlk — RichardNixonLibrary (@NixonLibrary) May 9, 2017

It's true that Nixon never fired a FBI director. That honor goes to Bill Clinton, who was the first (and up until Tuesday, the only) president to fire a FBI director. Back in 1993, Clinton fired William Sessions over ethical concerns. Sessions had refused to step down voluntarily.

Still, #Nixonian was trending Tuesday night after Comey's firing. In what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon made a controversial move when he ordered the firing Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor charged with the investigation into the Watergate scandal. That led to the resignations of his attorney general, Elliott Richardson, and his deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus.

WASHINGTON — President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey in the middle of several investigations of possible Trump campaign ties to last year’s Russian meddling in U.S. elections caused a firestorm of protest from Democratic members of Congress, with many calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

Some equated the firing with events known as the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" during the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he told Trump that he had made a “big mistake” when informed of the decision.

Schumer wondered aloud whether the firing meant Comey’s investigation was “getting too close to home,” and he said the handling of a credible investigation depends on Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein naming a “fearless, independent” special prosecutor.

“Mr. Rosenstein, America depends on you to restore faith in our criminal justice system which is going to be badly shattered after the administration’s actions today,"" Schumer said.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona called for the creation of a special congressional committee on Russia, while Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said he and his staff were ""reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia.""

""James Comey is a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" McCain said.

Comey, a Republican who had served in the George W. Bush administration as second in command in the Justice Department, was the surprise choice of President Barack Obama for the FBI post.

He had established his independence in March 2004 when then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales sought to get Comey’s boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft, to sign off on a secret National Security Agency wiretap program. Ashcroft, seriously ill in the hospital with pancreatitis, had turned his duties over to Comey, who told Gonzales in Ashcroft’s hospital room that he refused to authorize the program.

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the troubled House intelligence committee, said the firing raised profound questions about White House interference in a criminal probe.

“The decision by a president whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an Attorney General who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,” Schiff said, likening the event to the Watergate firings.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., suggested Trump’s action poses serious constitutional issues, while others called the development “Nixonian.”

“The termination and removal of James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raises the critical question as to whether the FBI investigation of Russian interference in the last presidential campaign will continue,” Durbin said.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate committee probing the Trump-Russia connection, called the firing “outrageous.”

“I have been long been a critic of Director Comey ... but Donald Trump’s decision to fire him now, in the midst of an investigation into Trump associates and their ties to Russia, is outrageous,"" Wyden said. He said Comey should be called to testify before Congress about the status of the Trump-Russia investigation.

“The president would do well to remember that in America, the truth always comes out.”

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who questioned Comey at a hearing before a Judiciary subcommittee this week, said the way Trump is handling the firing “is shocking.”

“No one should accept President Trump’s absurd justification that he is now concerned that FBI Director Comey treated Secretary Clinton unfairly,” Leahy said. “The president has removed the sitting FBI Director in the midst of one of the most critical national security investigations in the history of our country. This is nothing less than Nixonian.”

Leahy also noted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom the president consulted before the firing, was supposed to have recused himself. He said Rosenstein now has no choice but to appoint a special counsel.

A long list of others calling for an independent probe included Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Ben Cardin, D-Md., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., along with good government advocacy groups MoveOn.org and Common Cause.

Others reacted with more measured tones. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said simply that she had been informed by the president of his decision by phone, adding, “the next FBI director must be strong and independent and will receive a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee.”

One of the earliest Republican reactions came from Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn.: “While the case for removal of (FBI Director Comey) laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions.""

News of Comey’s departure came near the end of an hourlong telephone town hall meeting that House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., was having with constituents. “Lisa in Mendham” said she wanted to know what Congress was going to do now to hold Trump accountable “for his potentially breaking the law in dealing with Russia.”

Frelinghuysen didn’t answer that question directly but gave a positive appraisal of the job Comey has done.

“He had the reputation ... like his predecessor Robert Muller, of being a sort of straight-arrow guy,” Frelinghuysen said. “I do think he was an honorable man and represented an amazing department. I'm surprised he's gone. But in this business, I guess nothing is too surprising.”

WASHINGTON — After railing against FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, Democrats aligned with her presidential campaign reacted to his firing not with satisfaction — but with deep suspicion.

Among the former Clinton officials weighing in was her campaign manager Robby Mook. Despite frustration and disappointment over the way Comey handled the Clinton investigation, the announcement “terrifies me,” said Mook.

Twilight zone. I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled. But this terrifies me. — Robby Mook (@RobbyMook) May 9, 2017

Brian Fallon, who was a top communications official during the campaign, said he’s “not shedding any tears for Comey,” even as his firing makes him “worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now.”

I'm not shedding any tears for Comey personally -he hurt FBI's reputation- but I do worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) May 9, 2017

In a letter to Comey, Trump cited as cause for the FBI director’s firing his handling of the investigation into Clinton’s private email server, including public statements he made leading up to the presidential election. Yet Comey’s judgment over the email investigation has been an issue for several months. As recently as late January, Trump was seen patting Comey on the back during a White House reception to honor law enforcement officers.

What’s new is that Comey’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump campaign officials is heating up, including whether there is any evidence of collusion between the two as Russia sought to bolster Trump’s campaign and hurt Clinton’s, according to numerous U.S. intelligence agencies.

The firing also comes days after Comey testified before Congress about his handling of the email investigation during which he mistakenly stated that the FBI had obtained thousands of new emails from a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. While the FBI later corrected the misstatement, it appears to have given the White House an opening to fire the FBI director.

Comey came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats throughout the course of the Clinton investigation. It was days before the Nov. 8, 2016, election that Comey announced his team had found additional emails on the laptop of her aide, Huma Abedin, which the Clinton campaign blames for depressing votes in critical battlegrounds that Clinton lost to Trump by a small margin. During the hearing, Comey said he was “mildly nauseous” if his actions had any effect on the presidential election, while insisting he had no choice but to inform the public about the emails.

They also faulted Comey for speaking out about the investigation in July, when he explain why he decided against bringing charges against Clinton.

It was a break with normal FBI protocol, yet Comey may have felt pressure to speak out after former President Bill Clinton drew criticism for boarding the plane and having a private conversation with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey Tuesday came as a surprise to almost everyone. So, what better place for politicians, pundits and celebrities to share their shock, indignation, rage and/or glee than on Twitter?

Needless to say, Comey's firing did not go over well on the Democratic side of the aisle.

WASHINGTON — White House officials say President Trump based his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday on the ""clear recommendations"" of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a memo released Tuesday evening, Rosenstein sharply criticized the FBI chief, saying he mishandled the final stages of investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's treatment of classified State Department emails. The firing was needed to restore public confidence in the agency, Rosenstein concluded.

At the heart of the criticism: Comey's various public pronouncements about the investigation during the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. On July 5, Comey held a news conference in which he said no charges would be filed against Clinton. But on Oct 28, Comey announced that the probe had been reopened to examine newly discovered emails. Then, two days before before election, Comey once again weighed in, saying the department still was not recommending charges against the former secretary of State.

Here are key points in Rosenstein's memo:

1. ""The FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice. That is deeply troubling to many department employees and veterans, legislators and citizens.""

2. ""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unifies people of diverse perspectives.""

3. ""The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors.""

4. ""Compounding the error: The director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

5. ""Although the president has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former department officials. The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong.""

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Danny Green scored seven of his 16 points in overtime, and the San Antonio Spurs overcame an injury to Kawhi Leonard to beat James Harden and the Houston Rockets 110-107 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their second-playoff series.

Leonard had 22 points and 15 rebounds in 38 minutes before exiting with an injured right ankle. Leonard stepped on Harden's foot with 5:37 left in the third quarter and then played limited minutes before sitting out overtime.

Harden had 33 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. He had a chance at potential tying 3-pointer in the final seconds of OT, but was blocked from behind by Manu Ginobili.

""I know where his shot release is from,"" Ginobili said. ""I tried to bother him as much as I could. It was a risky play, but it was also risky to let him shoot.""

MANU. SEALED IT.#NBAPlayoffspic.twitter.com/0ewMHivxYY — NBA.com (@NBAcom) May 10, 2017

Aside from the block, Ginobili had 12 points, seven rebounds and five assists off the bench in the win. He also had a surprising dunk that he described as ""unexpected.""

""Manu reached back and gave us one of his Manu performances from past years,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He was a stud.""

Game 6 is Thursday in Houston.

Latest NBA playoff coverage:

Each team stalled at the start of the extra period. Patrick Beverley made a 3-pointer with 2 minutes remaining for the first points of the period, giving Houston a 104-101 lead.

Green made a go-ahead 3-pointer and converted a three-point play to make it 109-107 Spurs with 30.1 seconds left. He also made a foul shot down the stretch to help San Antonio hold on.

""The competitiveness was off the charts,"" Popovich said. ""Either team could've won the game down the stretch.""

Two questionable plays closed regulation with the game tied at 101.

Harden was whistled for a charge after dribbling all but a few seconds off the shot clock before driving to the basket on Jonathon Simmons. The Spurs failed to take a shot on their final possession, with Patty Mills banking in a 3-pointer after the buzzer sounded.

""We let one slip away,"" Harden said. ""Execution, rebounding. Two primary things we let slip away.""

Harden also played solid defense, helping hold Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge to 15-for-42 shooting as he rotated assignments in Houston's smaller lineup. But he finished with nine turnovers.

With the Rockets leading 82-81, officials ruled a ball out of bounds on the Spurs that replays showed was actually off Harden. Beverley drained a 3-pointer on the ensuing possession, prompting San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich to scream and point at official Derrick Stafford.

The play ignited what had been a rather listless San Antonio, leading to a 10-2 run bridging the third and fourth quarters for a 92-87 lead.

The Spurs tried to exploit a size advantage over the Rockets' small lineup early, especially when Harden was guarding either Aldridge and Pau Gasol. The Spurs' big men only managed 2-for-5 shooting in the opening three minutes, leading San Antonio to abandon the strategy midway through the first quarter and sub Simmons for Gasol.

Simmons responded by scoring 10 points on 5-for-13 shooting in 26 minutes.

TIP-INS

Rockets: Houston has lost four straight best-of-seven series when it was tied 2-2. The last time the Rockets won a series after being tied 2-2 was in the 1995 Western Conference finals when they beat the Spurs. . Nene is out for the remainder of the postseason after tearing his left adductor in Game 4. . The team that led at the half had won every game in the series until Game 5.

Spurs: Ginobili has 313 3-pointers in his postseason career, which is third in league history behind Ray Allen (385) and Reggie Miller (320). . Ginobili drove the lane for a one-handed dunk with 2 minutes left in the first half.

WASHINGTON — President Trump stunned the political world by firing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, an abrupt ending to a tenure marked by political controversies ranging from the Trump campaign's connections to Russia to Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails.

Basing his decision on the recommendations from both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Trump said in a statement that ""the FBI is one of our nation’s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement.""

The search for a new permanent FBI director will begin immediately, the White house said.

In recommending Comey's firing, the Justice Department leadership excoriated the FBI director for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. In a letter to Comey released by the White House, Trump agreed he ""was not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

Yet Comey's sudden dismissal calls into question the future of the investigation into Russian hacking of the 2016 presidential election. The FBI is currently in the midst of a full-blown counterintelligence inquiry, exploring charges of possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

Democrats — including some who had previously attacked Comey for his handling of the Clinton probe — saw Trump's move as a blatant attempt to short-circuit the Russia investigation.

""This is nothing less than Nixonian,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a reference to President Richard Nixon's decision in 1973 to remove the Watergate special prosecutor.

And Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's decision to fire the man overseeing a federal investigation into his campaign associates' collusion with Russia ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter.""

Schiff, whose panel is conducting a separate investigation into Russia's influence on the presidential election, called for an independent prosecutor ""to restore a modicum of public confidence — now completely lacking — that the criminal investigation will continue without further interference by the White House.""

If Trump were truly upset with Comey about his handling of the Clinton probe, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, he could have fired Comey on his first day in office. Instead, the Senate's top Democrat said, the president waited until Congress and FBI investigations into Russia heated up.

""Given the way the President has fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration,"" Schumer said. Without an independent special prosecutor, he added, ""every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up.""

For his part, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Trump's actions ""threaten"" the critical investigations now underway ""and the integrity and independence of the FBI.""

5 key points in memo calling for FBI Director James Comey's firing

In his termination letter, Trump referred to the FBI's ongoing investigation, telling Comey he appreciated him ""informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

Still, the concern about the timing of Comey's firing was not limited to Democrats.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., who is leading the Senate panel’s investigation into Russia’s election interference, said he was “troubled’’ by both the timing and reasons for Comey’s dismissal. ""I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the committee,’’ Burr said. “In my interactions with the director and with the bureau under his leadership, he and the FBI have always been straightforward with our committee.

“Director Comey has been more forthcoming with information than any FBI director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intelligence committees,"" he continued. ""His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.”

A career prosecutor, Comey, held top Justice Department posts in the George W. Bush administration before being appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

He is only the second director fired in the 82-year history of the FBI. President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions in 1993 amid ethics problems. While FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms in order to make them nominally non-partisan, they can still be fired by the president.

As news of Comey's dismissal raced through Washington on Tuesday night, Republicans defended the move as difficult but necessary.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Comey's ""decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts.""

Meanwhile, Comey was apparently finding out his own employment status in an unconventional way.

Comey left Washington earlier Tuesday for a speaking engagement, and was not informed of his firing until he saw news reports of it on television while at the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, a person familiar with the matter said.

The abrupt firing came just after the FBI confirmed Comey provided erroneous testimony to a Senate panel about how Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin handled classified emails.

Notably, some of the same Democrats upset about Comey's firing have also previously called for his head, blaming Clinton's loss of the presidency on Comey's unexpected public announcement on Oct. 28 that he was re-opening the investigation into her emails.

Rosenstein, confirmed by the Senate two weeks ago as Comey's day-to-day supervisor, also faulted Comey for announcing he had re-opened the case 11 days before the election — and for his earlier July 5 news conference saying no charges would be filed against Clinton.

In a memo to the attorney general, Rosenstein said he did not understand Comey's refusal to acknowledge fault with his actions.

""Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of different perspectives,"" Rosenstein wrote.

Late Tuesday, Attorney General Sessions sent a message to the entire FBI, saying that Trump had “exercised his lawful authority to remove’’ Comey.

“By operation of law and effective immediately, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe assumed the position of acting director of the FBI,’’ Sessions wrote. “As you well know, the FBI is an exceptional law enforcement agency. It is made by you, the devoted men and women who work tirelessly to keep our country safe. Thank you for your steadfast dedication and commitment during this time of transition.’’

How did we get here? A James Comey timeline

Tweets fly fast and furious following firing of FBI head Comey

James Comey is one of several officials President Trump fired

Meanwhile, as Comey remains the target of public criticism over his handling of the Clinton case, the Justice Department’s inspector general is in the midst of wide-ranging review of Justice’s handling of the matter, including Comey’s leadership of it.

Last week, Comey disclosed in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had been interviewed by Justice investigators assigned to the case and expected to be questioned again.

“I have a story to tell,’’ Comey told the panel.

Comey, 56, succeeded Robert Mueller, the longest serving FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover. Mueller served for 12 years before leaving the bureau.

A former chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan and former deputy attorney general, Comey won plaudits for his independence as a key player in one of the most dramatic moments during the George W. Bush administration.

With then-Attorney General John Ashcroft hospitalized in 2004 with acute pancreatitis, Deputy Attorney General Comey rushed to his boss’ bedside at George Washington Hospital when he learned that then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House chief of staff Andrew Card were trying to persuade Ashcroft to reauthorize a controversial warrantless eavesdropping program.

Since taking office, Comey has staked out the highest profile of any director since Hoover.

In any venue, the 6-foot-8-inch Comey is hard to miss. Often referring to himself as an “awkward white guy,’’ he was anything but while delivering testimony before Congress engaging audiences in public and private forums.

Even in high-stakes congressional hearings, Comey often operated without written text and rarely sought advice from aides who accompanied him.

His public and controversial handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation was only the latest in a string of public positions that the director took that did not always sit well with the White House and the Justice Department — including under Obama's administration.

He bluntly acknowledged law enforcement’s fraught relationship with the racial and ethnic communities in addresses at Georgetown University and in Birmingham, Ala., and has suggested that less-aggressive policing may be contributing to spikes in violent crime in some parts of the country—a position that put him at odds with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Obama White House.

He drew the wrath of the tech industry and privacy advocates last year as the face of the government’s legal battle with Apple Inc., to gain access to the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook. With Apple insisting that creating a way to break into the device's default encryption would be tantamount to giving the FBI a ""backdoor"" that could be used to break into Apple products again and again, Comey described the dispute as the “hardest problem I’ve encountered in my entire government career.’’

At another point, Comey acknowledged the vexing nature of battling homegrown violent extremists, ticking off a list of recent bloody assaults and attempted attacks that have scarred communities across the country, from Garland, Texas to Orlando, Fla. His public concern about the FBI's capacity to confront the growing homegrown threat, prompted lawmakers to question whether the bureau had the resources to deal with it.

As the White House searches for a replacement, FBI Agents Association President Thomas O’Connor called on the Trump administration to proceed with “caution.""

“A change in FBI leadership of this magnitude must be handled carefully and with an eye towards ensuring that the bureau can continue to fulfill its responsibility to protect the American public from criminal and national security threats,’’ O’Connor said.

“We greatly appreciate Director Comey’s service, leadership, and support for special agents during his tenure. He understood the centrality of the agent to the bureau's mission, recognizing that agents put their lives on the line every day. His focus was to ensure that the bureau’s investigations complied with the law and the constitution, and that agents performed their mission with integrity and professionalism. As vital stakeholders, FBI agents should be given a voice in the process of selecting the next director.”

16,What's up with Melania Trump's cyber bullying campaign? It's 'a work in progress',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In a rare campaign speech, Melania Trump said that one of her key issues as First Lady would be to combat cyber bullying Time

Melania Trump, America's historic first lady, pledged before the election that she would lead a campaign against cyber bullying.

But so far, say leaders and activists in anti-cyber bullying efforts, neither Trump nor her East Wing staff have reached out, nor have they responded to offers to help.

""I'm not seeing any movement towards an initiative that she's endorsed,"" says first lady historian Myra Gutin of Rider University in New Jersey. ""She's hired some staff but not up to the level that other first ladies have done by now.""

Trump's press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, says the anti-cyber bullying effort is still a work in progress. ""Mrs. Trump is being very thoughtful when it comes to building out her initiatives,"" Grisham said in an email. Also, her staff now numbers 10, and she's taking her time hiring because she values ""quality over quantity.""

Trump herself declined to comment, as she has routinely since she became first lady. But on Nov. 3, 2016, she attracted widespread attention when she announced in a rare speech that she would fight cyber bullying as her first-lady cause if her husband, Donald Trump, were elected.

“Technology has changed our universe. But like anything that is powerful it can have a bad side,"" she told an audience of suburban women in Berwyn, Pa. ""Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and to teenagers.”

Her declaration brought out plenty of ire on social media from those who consider Donald Trump the definition of a cyber bully given his aggressive social media attacks against anyone who piques his fury.

Lady Gaga, whose Born This Way Foundation aims to combat bullying, especially of LGBT kids, was scathing, though Gaga's representative did not return a message from USA TODAY seeking comment on how she feels about Melania Trump now.

.@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for ""anti-bullying"" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed. — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) November 6, 2016

But there was no mocking from other anti-cyber bullying activists, who say they remain patient and hopeful that Trump will launch her initiative soon.

""We have tried to reach out to her and offer the services and expertise of our organization; so far, we have not heard back,"" says Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, founder of the Institute of Digital Media and Child Development in New York. Still, ""I’m delighted that Melania Trump chose cyber bullying. I think she could do a tremendous amount for the children and adolescents who are suffering as a result of it.""

Since the election, excited activists have been sending Trump advice and proposals, such as holding an annual online safety summit at the White House, says Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.

""We haven’t heard anything from FLOTUS at all (so) I’m not in a position to speak to what she is or is not doing since we’re not connected yet,"" says Hinduja.

He says ""everyone in my line of work has been buzzing"" since Trump's speech. He says ""good progress"" has been made on cyber bullying over the last eight years by the White House, the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education.

""And we’re just hoping that there will be continued and even increased support and contributions from the highest office in the land,"" he says. ""That is tremendously exciting for all of us.""

The Family Online Safety Institute welcomed Trump to the cause in December, issuing a set of recommendations such as: Inaugurating an annual Online Safety Summit at the White House; creating a chief online safety officer; and persuading the new administration to set up a $25 million research-and-education fund over five years to create educational programs for children and their parents on cyber bullying and online safety in general.

""We are still waiting to hear from her or her office about how she wishes to take this topic on,"" says Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Washington-based group. ""The only indication we’ve had is that speech before the election. And then, of course, she has mostly remained in New York. So there's not been a great deal of movement yet.

""But of those I've spoken to, including in my own organization, we’re cautiously optimistic.""

Susan Swearer, a psychology professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network, says she's not been contacted by Trump's team. ""It’s such important work and there’s a huge need for creating kinder and supportive online and offline spaces, so I hope FLOTUS decides to engage in this important work,"" she says.

Donna Rice Hughes, a key figure in a 1987 political scandal that ended a Democratic presidential campaign, has been a respected leader on Internet safety for kids for more than two decades through her Enough is Enough non-profit. She endorsed Donald Trump and though she hasn't heard yet from Melania, she is convinced it will happen and that mothers especially will relate to the new FLOTUS.

""She is modeling what it means to have a balanced life and the difficulty most women who have families are having in trying to keep that all in balance,"" says Hughes. ""I am not at all concerned or surprised she's taking some time. It's very clear right now her priority is her son. She’s got four years minimum, maybe eight, to deal with cyber bullying.""

Official Portrait of First Lady pic.twitter.com/K1DUVE5kSI — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) April 3, 2017

Could President Trump's online blasts undermine the first lady's cause? Possibly, says Balkam, but it would depend on the specifics of her initiative. If she focuses on, say, child-on-child cyber bullying, ""it's possible nothing he does undermines what she tries to do. But let’s wait and see.""

Combating digital bullying is not a new cause nor an inconsequential one, according to the experts and activists who have been laboring in relative obscurity for years, concerned about analysis (from the Cyberbullying Research Center in Orlando, for instance) showing that two-thirds of students who experience cyber bullying say it affected their ability to learn and feel safe at school.

Monica Lewinsky has been a recent high-profile voice on the issue: She called for an end to the ""culture of humiliation"" in a powerful TED talk in 2015. ""Cruelty is nothing new. But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible,"" she said then. ""Millions of people can stab you with their words and that's a lot of pain.""

She would seem to be a perfect ally to Melania Trump — and in fact, she defended the Trumps' young son, Barron, after he was mocked online — but her spokeswoman, Dini von Mueffling, confirmed to USA TODAY that so far Lewinsky has not heard from Trump.

all children need to be protected from bullying + mockery. (incl #barrontrump). let's be better than this. https://t.co/CH3IfdpQpu — Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) January 23, 2017

But nothing beats a first lady's spotlight for focusing attention. So far, Trump has said nothing about cyber bullying in public, except on April 26, when she celebrated her 47th birthday at a lunch for Senate spouses at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

Grisham confirmed Trump mentioned cyber bullying at the lunch, thanking the group for a donation they made in her name to an anti-bullying organization, which is the tradition of the Senate spouses group for every incoming new first lady. But the lunch was closed to the media at the behest of the group so there's no official transcript.

Soon after the election, Donald Trump said his third wife would not move into the White House immediately after the inauguration; instead, she would remain in New York so that Barron, 11, could finish the school year.

Grisham maintains she's still been ""100% present"" as first lady since Jan. 20, and anyway nowadays people can work remotely from anywhere.

For comparison, Michelle Obama also said her first priority would be her children when she became first lady in 2009, though she immediately was visible and active. She did not fully launch her first initiative, her campaign for healthy eating and against childhood obesity, until nine months after she came to the White House.

""With Mrs. Trump, who's not living here yet and who's just starting to assemble her team, it may take a little longer to roll out her first initiative, but it will be done with a level of full knowledge, research and careful attention to the important data out there on this issue,"" predicts Anita McBride, who worked in multiple administrations, was former first lady Laura Bush's chief of staff and now studies the legacies of first ladies at American University in Washington.

But her absence has been noticed: Stylish and statuesque, the ex-model stands out when she is present, stimulating further curiosity about her. But she remains largely inscrutable; unlike her polished stepdaughter, businesswoman-turned-White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, Melania has not done media interviews about her plans.

Does it matter that Trump has been a slow-starting FLOTUS?

Every new first lady takes a different approach, says McBride, and it's nothing to worry about. ""We may have to get used to, with this new first lady, she's not going to do it the way her predecessors did it; she's going to do it the way it fits her best. That may be more limited but it will be just as impactful.""

First-lady expert Kate Andersen

Brower,

author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies,

says she's sympathetic to the notion that Trump needs more time to understand the job. ""While they get a honeymoon period, I think that's quickly coming to an end,"" Andersen Brower says.

Gutin suspects most people don't care, but she thinks Trump is missing an opportunity.

""The tradition is that the presidential spouse gives us some insight into the character of the president, and certainly since Jacqueline Kennedy those of us who care about it have always thought the first lady can use (the White House audience) to do a lot of good,"" Gutin says. ""Does it matter to the success of an administration? Probably not. But there is the opportunity there and she's not taking advantage of it.""

Or not yet, anyway.

9,Kawhi Leonard clarifies his Game 6 injury status after sitting out OT in Spurs win | FOX Sports,"The San Antonio Spurs found a way to win Game 5, but they seemed to take a big blow along the way.

Kawhi Leonard suffered a lower leg injury in the second half on Tuesday when he landed on James Harden’s foot, an injury that forced the two-time Defensive Player of the Year to miss San Antonio’s final possession of regulation and the entirety of overtime.

But the Spurs received some good news after the game. Leonard, who was walking with a pronounced limp, told reporters he won’t miss Game 6 on Thursday in Houston.

""Yeah, I'm gonna be able to play."" -Kawhi Leonard (ankle) #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/ZXwGtqcQMa — NBA TV (@NBATV) May 10, 2017

LEONARD: “It’s a little sore, but I mean, my teammates did a good job of closing out that game with me not being able to go that last stretch.”

REPORTER: “Is it an ankle or knee?”

LEONARD: “Ankle.” […]

REPORTER: “Pop said you wanted to play, but it was obvious that you needed to come out. How severe of an injury is it? Do you think you’ll be able to play in Game 6?”

LEONARD: “Yeah, I’m going to be able to play.”

Leonard naturally struggled for most of the second half following the injury, finishing with 22 points on 8-for-21 shooting, along with 15 rebounds and four assists.

The Spurs got a huge boost from Manu Ginobili with Leonard on the bench, as the 15-year veteran came up with a massive block on Harden on the final possession of overtime to seal San Antonio’s win.

The question now for the Spurs is how limited Leonard might be in what could be a close-out Game 6. Even before the Leonard injury, San Antonio reverted to its switch-heavy defense, rather than having its franchise player try to lock down Harden for most of the night.

If Leonard isn’t 100 percent on Thursday, it stands to reason the Spurs would use a similar defensive tactic, encouraging Harden to attack mismatches in isolation instead of running the typical Houston offense.

Either way, Game 6 should be a ton of fun.",fox-sports
9,Jimmie Rivera meets Thomas Almeida at FOX UFC Fight Night in New York | FOX Sports,"Two top ranked bantamweights will clash at the upcoming FOX UFC Fight Night card in New York when Jimmie Rivera meets Thomas Almeida on July 22 at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island.

The new fight was first announced via Newsday on Tuesday.

Rivera (20-1) has been flawless thus far in his UFC career with four consecutive wins including a victory over new UFC Hall of Fame inductee Urijah Faber this past September.

Rivera has been clamoring for a big fight as he continues his climb up the bantamweight rankings and now he’ll face one of the most dangerous threats the divison has to offer.

Most recently, Almeida dispatched Albert Morales in the second round, which marked his 17th career victory by way of knockout or TKO.

Almeida’s only setback in the UFC came to current bantamweight champion Cody Garbrandt, but now he’s ready to resume his course towards title contention as he faces a tough challenge in Rivera in July.

And they did it with their best player in Kawhi Leonard sidelined for the entire overtime session.

Leonard suffered what appeared to be an ankle injury earlier in the game, and tried his best to play through it. But once it became clear that he couldn’t go, Gregg Popovich made the difficult decision to bench him down the stretch. Thanks to huge plays from Danny Green and Manu Ginobili — along with some brutal offensive possessions from James Harden and the Rockets, especially in overtime — San Antonio was able to win in spite of Leonard’s absence.

9,Dana White: 'There's going to be a point where I'm done' pursuing McGregor vs. Mayweather | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White committed to doing everything possible to land Conor McGregor a lucrative payday against Floyd Mayweather, but the fight is still no closer to reality.

On Saturday night after Saul “Canelo” Alvarez dished out a punishing decision in his fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., his next bout against Gennady Golovkin was announced for September 16.

That was the date originally reserved for the proposed matchup between McGregor and Mayweather, but White says he just wasn’t able to strike a deal with both sides in time so a different boxing match scooped up that Saturday on the schedule.

“The reason they got my date is because I couldn’t get my deal done on time so they got the date,” White told “The Herd” on Tuesday. “Listen, life moves on, we don’t wait for anybody. The fights are going to keep rolling. I didn’t get the deal done fast enough so I lose the date. That’s how it works.”

A date being targeted for the fight might make it appear that a deal is imminent but White says that couldn’t be further from the truth.

In fact, he says he’s no closer to closing the negotiations to put together the fight between McGregor and Mayweather and there will come a day when he is forced to give up if the two sides can’t reach an amicable agreement.

“I’m not hinting that it’s getting close at all. I knew that this thing was going to be a nightmare to get done if it can even be done. We’ll find out,” White said. “Obviously, both guys want to fight each other but what’s the deal. Can the deal be done? That’s the question.

“It’s not just Mayweather. It’s both sides of this thing are going to be hard to get done. Absolutely, there’s going to be a point where I’m done. This isn’t what I do, this isn’t my business and I’m definitely going to walk away.”

White can’t say for certain when that deadline will be reached where he’ll no longer participate in the negotiations, but he promises it could eventually happen.

As much as he wants to put the fight together for McGregor, who stands to potentially make up to nine-figures for the bout, White will eventually reach his breaking point.

“Either way, it doesn’t matter to me. I know that these two guys want to fight. I’ve said many times, I respect Conor and I’d like to do this fight for him but it’s got to be the right deal. We have to get the right deal done or it’s not going to happen,” White said. “Because at the end of the day, this isn’t what I do. The UFC is what I do and I should be focusing on that and not a boxing match.

“Obviously, a lot of people want to see it, there’s a lot of interest in it, but it’s not really what I do.”",fox-sports

9,UFC finally confirms women's flyweight division launching with 'Ultimate Fighter' 26 | FOX Sports,"Let’s try this one more time.

Last week the UFC announced and then retracted plans to launch a women’s flyweight division with season 26 on “The Ultimate Fighter” with filming expected to start in July.

Now the UFC has finally rolled out the plan — again — to kick off the 125-pound women’s division with the new season of the reality show where fighters from outside the UFC as well as competitors currently on the roster can try out for the season that will crown the first ever champion.

Tryouts will be held on May 23 at the Palace Station Hotel in Las Vegas. Fighters are required to be between the ages of 21-34 with at least three fights and a winning professional record.

The stutter step for the announcement didn’t slow down the excitement for several fighters already competing in the UFC, who have already expressed interest in moving to flyweight once the division opens.

Jessica Eye, who was previously ranked as the No. 1 fighter in the world at flyweight, has already told FOX Sports that if she wins her next bout on July 7 against Aspen Ladd that she plans to move down to 125 pounds.

Former “Ultimate Fighter” competitor Bec Rawlings has also mentioned a potential move to flyweight although it doesn’t appear she’s interested in competing during another season of the reality show after already doing that once previously in her career.

Lauren Murphy has stated that she plans on gunning for a spot on the reality show with an aim to become the first ever women’s flyweight champion in the UFC.

The new season of “The Ultimate Fighter” featuring the flyweights will begin filming in July with the show airing on FS1 later this year.",fox-sports

South Korea's new leader Moon Jae-in has been sworn in, vowing to address the economy and relations with the North in his first speech as president.

He said that he would even be willing to visit Pyongyang under the right circumstances.

Mr Moon took his oath of office in Seoul's National Assembly building a day after his decisive win.

The former human rights lawyer and son of North Korean refugees is known for his liberal views.

Tensions on the Korean peninsula remain high and recent weeks have seen the US and Pyongyang trade angry rhetoric as speculation about another nuclear test grows.

Mr Moon has also vowed to unify a divided country reeling from a corruption scandal which saw his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, impeached.

In his inauguration speech, Mr Moon said he would ""do everything I can to build peace on the Korean peninsula"".

""If needed I will fly to Washington immediately,"" he said. ""I will also go to Beijing and Tokyo and even Pyongyang in the right circumstances.""

He added that he would have ""serious negotiations"" with the US and China over the controversial deployment of anti-missile system Thaad.

North Korea has yet to officially comment on Mr Moon's victory and remarks. It had previously hinted that Mr Moon was its preferred candidate.

The 64-year-old Democratic Party candidate has also promised to bolster the economy and address youth unemployment, which are key concerns for voters.

Who is Moon?

Who is South Korea's new president?

Mr Moon has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations, which took a hardline stance against Pyongyang, for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.

Since the Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953, there have only been two summits where the leaders of the two Koreas have met, both held in Pyongyang.

Mr Moon spearheaded preparations for the second meeting in 2007, when serving as a presidential aide.

9,Manu Ginobili saved the San Antonio Spurs ... and only delayed the inevitable | FOX Sports,"Unfortunately, all Ginobili did in Game 5 was delay the inevitable.

This Rockets-Spurs series has perfectly illustrated San Antonio's shortcomings in a potential Western Conference finals series against the Golden State Warriors. It's not that the Spurs lack athleticism, although that will be a problem against the back-to-back NBA Finals.

And it's not that the Spurs are doomed from behind the arc. San Antonio can chuck with the best of them. If they take care of business against Houston (no sure thing, to be sure) and keep the pace slow against Golden State, the Spurs might be able to hang around.

The problem continues to be LaMarcus Aldridge. Outside of a spectacular Game 3 performance, the Spurs big man is borderline unplayable against precise offensive teams that move the ball and look for the best shot.

He's the reason San Antonio keeps switching all of its pick-and-rolls, instead of fighting through screens and having Kawhi guard Harden one-on-one. Aldridge simply doesn't have the ability to jump out, corral the ball-handler, and recover to his man in time. He never has.

So the Spurs have made a conscious decision to switch everything, keeping shooters in front of them and goading Harden into trying to beat Aldridge off the dribble in isolation. It's probably the right play, assuming Leonard doesn't have the energy to carry San Antonio on offense and wreak complete havoc on every defensive possession.",fox-sports

6,Trump on Comey firing: 'They will be thanking me',"Story highlights Trump said his dismissal of Comey would be validated after ""things calm down""

Senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump defended his abrupt decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, saying on Wednesday his decision will be seen in a better light after the furious controversy dies down.

At one point in a series of tweets, Trump said his dismissal of Comey -- who came under withering criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation -- would be validated after ""things calm down.""

""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"" Trump tweeted.

Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

He led off the tweetstorm with criticism of Democrats, who have loudly called for a special prosecutor to look into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia. Democrats -- and some Republicans -- were quick on Tuesday to claim that Trump was ridding himself of an investigator who was delving too deeply into ties between his associates and Russia.

""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"" Trump wrote.

6,America's new post-Comey reality,"It leaves the nation confronting complicated questions about the relationship between government and independent law enforcement, the nature of Trump's use of power and possibly even the integrity of the presidency itself.

Trump already had Washington on edge three months into his term. But his sudden strike against Comey was unconventional even by his own standards, and immediately and significantly exacerbated the discord that has raged since he took office. It may also have delivered another damaging blow to his own viability and the goodwill he needs to build a successful presidency.

As a shocked Washington digested the implications of Trump's political decapitation of Comey, accusations from Trump critics began to fly, and his defenders struggled to summon effective counterattacks.

But this was not just politics as usual. Something very significant had just occurred: The President fired an FBI chief overseeing a probe into claims his own campaign colluded with Russia to meddle in last year's election.

FBI directors always serve at the pleasure of the President. But it was those circumstances that left everyone breathless.

""I think it is profoundly troubling for our democracy,"" CNN's senior political analyst David Gergen said. ""(Trump) may not mean to, but he is giving the impression that he thinks danger is getting too close.""

Whatever that turns out to be true or not, Trump's move raised several possibilities, neither of which are likely to end well for him.

First, there is the question of whether Comey firing marks a deliberate attempt to disrupt the Russia investigation -- which would potentially amount to an abuse of power.

Alternatively, Comey's dismissal made quickly on Tuesday afternoon following a Justice Department recommendation, will appear to be an impulsive swipe made with little forethought and or insight into consequences that hint at gross political negligence.

Historical precedent?

News of Trump's breathtaking decision broke just before 6 p.m. ET after a comparatively normal Tuesday in Washington, which was digging in for the GOP's long campaign to navigate an Obamacare repeal bill through the Senate.

Everyone was left groping for a historical precedent and had the same thought at once: Watergate.

Trump's dismissal of Comey brought to mind President Richard Nixon's order for Attorney General Eliot Richardson to sack special prosecutor Archibald Cox in 1973 -- a move that unleashed political forces that would eventually bring him down in disgrace. (Richardson and a deputy refused and resigned instead.)

""The only historical parallel is the Saturday Night Massacre,"" CNN Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said.

JUST WATCHED Comey's firing compared to Nixon 'massacre' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Comey's firing compared to Nixon 'massacre' 01:13

CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin accused Trump of a ""grotesque abuse of power.""

Most immediately, the firing of Comey spurs questions about the future course of the investigation into Russia election interference.

After all, the President will now have to nominate a new director changed with overseeing the investigation into his own associates -- raising immediate questions over the new FBI boss' independence.

Those who see a nefarious hand in the firing will note that every investigation into the Russia issue -- in the FBI and in Congress, will now be overseen by a Trump appointee or a Republican.

And any new FBI chief nominated by Trump -- who vowed Wednesday to replace Comey with ""someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI"" -- is now guaranteed a rocky and acrimonious confirmation process.

The rationale for the firing of Comey is also set to come under intense security.

JUST WATCHED Fallon calling for special counsel at DOJ Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Fallon calling for special counsel at DOJ 01:25

The rationale

Newly confirmed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein laid out a charge sheet related to Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation which many Democrats believe cost their candidate the presidency last year.

Yet Comey's actions -- including publicly upbraiding the former secretary of state for her stewardship of classified information even though she was not charged -- were raucously backed by Trump on the campaign trail.

And Trump's team has never shown anything but contempt for Clinton's complaints about the way the email saga derailed her campaign.

So the idea that the President was suddenly motivated by a desire to clean up that episode seems far fetched.

Even if he was, critics want to know why Comey was fired on Tuesday with new questions about Russia swirling around the White House and not as soon as Trump took office.

The fate of the FBI investigation itself must also now be in question.

Despite Democratic antipathy, Comey still boasted a reputation for integrity. Amid the congressional shenanigans over the Russia matter, Comey's was easily the most authoritative voice. When he announced during a Capitol Hill hearing two months ago that his agents were probing for any links between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence operatives, it put a much more serious cast on the entire episode.

Now that voice is silent.

Brookings Institution scholars Benjamin Wittes and Susan Hennessey, who is also a CNN analyst, said Tuesday's events raised profound legal and ethical issues.

""There's also no question that removing the FBI director in the midst of a high-stakes investigation of Russian influence in the inner circle of the President's campaign and White House is a horrifying breach of every expectation we have of the relationship between the White House and federal law enforcement,"" they wrote on the Lawfare blog.

Comey's dismissal and the administration's motivation will inject a new and time consuming new element into congressional probes into the Russia affair.

Investigations in the House and Senate, struggling with a mountain of evidence and political infighting had already looked to stretch on for months. Now they seem all but inevitable to stretch into next year least before they find answers.

Political implications

Then there are the political implications unleashed by Trump's move for the White House itself.

The Russia drama has hounded this administration even before its first days in office, over claims of Moscow's interference in the election, Trump's affinity for President Vladimir Putin and ties to Moscow of aides like sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

Now it seems unlikely that the suspicions and accusation will ever go away and seem certain to inflict new damage on Trump's already compromised approval ratings.

At early on the White House seemed unprepared for the firestorm that quickly came its way on Tuesday evening.

Administration officials fanned out to talk to reporters outside the presidential mansion and headed to cameras to go on cable networks.

On CNN, Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway told Anderson Cooper ""this has nothing to do with Russia.""

""Somebody must be getting $50 every time (Russia) is said on TV ... (This) has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the President's confidence and can faithfully execute his duties,"" she said.

On Wednesday, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will face a test of fire at the podium in the White House briefing room. One question she will face is whether the administration is seeking to close down the Russia probes.

After all, Comey is not the first to be shown the door for at least appearing to pose a threat to the White House.

On Monday, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified to senators about how she was fired days after warning that Flynn could be compromised by Russia. The administration insists she was dismissed for refusing to implement Trump's travel ban on residents of seven Muslim nations.

Preet Bharara, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who had jurisdiction over the area of Trump Tower, was also fired by the President.

The White House meanwhile appears at the very least to have sought to sow distraction in the House intelligence committee investigation into Russian election meddling -- which ended with the chairman of the panel, GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, having to step down with his independence besmirched.

Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly spoken and tweeted in a manner that suggests he is trying to discredit the investigations.

""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?"" Trump tweeted the day before firing Comey.

While none of these examples proves clear wrongdoing by the White House, together they add up to a pattern that is fuels suspicion among Trump critics.

Major challenge

One major challenge for the White House now will be to solidify support among Republicans and head off Democratic claims that a special prosecutor or independent probe into the Russian evidence is now inevitable.

Some Republicans, like Sens. Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, did initially take the administration's rationale for dismissing Comey at face value.

But others are wavering.

Sen. Richard Burr, who chairs the Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian election meddling, expressed extreme concern over Tuesday's events.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,"" the North Carolina Republican said in a statement.

Other Republicans struggled to make sense of the White House's behavior.

""Regardless of how you think Director Comey handled the unprecedented complexities of the 2016 election cycle, the timing of this firing is very troubling,"" said GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska.

Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake meanwhile tweeted: ""I've spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing. I just can't do it.""",cnn
6,"They were investigating Trump, and then they were fired","(CNN) After President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, questions immediately arose about the President's motivations for his dismissal -- and for the recent firings of two other then-President Barack Obama-appointees who were in the middle of conducting investigations linked to Trump.

""They fired Sally Yates. They fired Preet Bharara. And they fired James Comey , the very man leading he investigation. This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" Schumer said shortly after the announcement, calling for a special independent prosecutor into the Trump campaign's ties to the Kremlin.

""Any person who he appoints to lead the Russian investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey,"" he said.

CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was ""absurd.""

Toobin branded the move a ""grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States,"" comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.

James Comey

Then-FBI Director James Comey testifies in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee during an oversight hearing on Capitol Hill May 3, 2017 in Washington, DC.

The FBI director saw his reputation compromised when he became embroiled in the 2016 election campaign. He was first criticized by Republicans when he announced he wouldn't be charging then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her emails, and then by Democrats for publicly reopening the case days before Americans went to the polls.

Why was he fired?

The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that the erstwhile director was ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

What was he investigating?

As head of the FBI, he was overseeing the investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties to the Kremlin. Democrats have ridiculed the notion that the Clinton issue is what truly prompted Comey's dismissal, drawing parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggesting Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.

Where is the investigation now?

At a hearing last week, Comey confirmed that the FBI's investigation into accusations of coordination between Trump's presidential campaign and Russian officials was continuing. It's not clear if the incoming FBI director will pick up where Comey left off.

Sally Yates

Former US Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates testifies before the Senate Judicary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Capitol Hill May 8.

Appointed by Obama, former Deputy Attorney General Yates had been running Trump's Justice Department as Acting Attorney General while Trump's nominee for the role, Sen. Jeff Sessions, awaited confirmation. She became a household name when Trump abruptly removed her from the temporary position.

Why was she fired?

Ostensibly for her refusal to implement the first iteration of Trump's ban on travelers from a number of Muslim-majority countries.

""The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement at the time, explaining the President's actions.

What was she investigating?

As part of the probe into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump administration, then-acting Attorney General Yates met with White House counsel to inform them that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn wasn't telling the truth about his interactions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and, as a result, represented a blackmail risk.

""We believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,"" Yates said in a Senate subcommittee hearing aimed at gathering details of the Russian hacking of the 2016 election on Monday in Washington.

""Logic would tell you that you don't want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him,"" she added.

Where is the investigation now?

Yates said Monday that she warned the White House earlier this year that former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn could be ""essentially blackmailed by the Russians.""

Preet Bharara

Preet Bharara, then-US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, at the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in June 2016.

Preet Bharara, former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was known as one of Wall Street's fiercest watchdogs and a widely respected prosecutor.

Why was he fired?

Bharara first refused to resign along with 46 US attorneys across the country. Although it is common for incoming administrations to replace district attorneys when transitioning to power, Trump had previously assured Bharara that he'd keep his job.

Sources told CNN that Bharara had been told after a meeting with Trump in November that he could stay on, and that he felt blindsided by the request. He was fired after refusing to comply.

At the time, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren posted a series of tweets suggesting Bharara was removed in part because he ""had authority over Trump Tower.""

Bharara suggested that this was indeed the case. ""I wanted it to be on record that there was a deliberate decision to change (his) mind and fire me, particularly given what my office's jurisdiction is,"" he said.

What was he investigating?

Bharara's office had many investigations ongoing at the time of his firing, including one involving Trump favorite Fox News

And then there's the President's claim that he was wiretapped in Trump Tower on orders of then-President Obama, whose investigation led back to the Southern District of New York.

""Trump has undoubtedly decided that he wants his own pick rather than the choice of Senate adversary (and minority leader) Chuck Schumer in place as the top federal prosecutor in New York,"" CNN legal analyst Paul Callan wrote in March.

6,Here is who Trump could pick to replace Comey,"(CNN) By firing FBI director James Comey on Tuesday, President Donald Trump has created a near-impossible standard for his replacement.

Some Republicans, in an attempt to protect Trump's decision to fire Comey in the midst of his investigation into Trump associates, Russia and the 2016 election, argued that his replacement will have to be someone who has unquestionable credibility with a deep background in law enforcement matters.

Democrats agree, but argue Trump's next FBI director must also have no connections to Trump politically or professionally, making it impossible for anyone to question the next director's conflict of interest.

Working in Trump's favor is the fact that his next FBI director only needs 51 votes to get through the Senate.

Here's a list of people Trump could pick to replace Comey:

Rudy Giuliani

Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, would likely be among Trump's top choices for FBI director, given his loyalty to the President and law enforcement background.

But his vocal advocacy for Trump during the 2016 campaign and clear partisan bent would make it nearly impossible for the former New York mayor to get confirmed by the Senate, even if he only needed 51 votes.

Giuliani's record is chock full of anti-Hillary Clinton comments, too.

""When I see her, I see her in an orange jumpsuit, I'm sorry,"" he said days before the 2016 election. ""Or at least a striped one.""

Chris Christie

Christie is in the same boat as Giuliani.

The New Jersey governor was one of the first top flight Republicans to endorse Trump during the 2016 campaign and stood by him during some of the most trying times in his presidential campaign. His loyalty was rewarded by summarily being fired from the Trump transition, in large measure because of he, as United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, put Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's father in jail.

But Christie has remained loyal to Trump and was appointed to lead the President's opioid and drug abuse commission earlier this year. He has a law enforcement background and would be close to Trump.

But like Giuliani, he is clearly partisan.

""Is she guilty or not guilty,"" the former federal prosecutor bellowed during the 2016 Republican National Convention after talking about Clinton's character and judgment. The crowd then chanted, ""Lock her up,"" which Christie egged on.

Ray Kelly

Should Trump consider Kelly, the former commissioner of the New York City Policy Department, it wouldn't be the first time the long-time New Yorker was mentioned as a possible candidate for FBI director.

The New York Times reported in 1993, after Kelly first severed as commissioner of the NYPD after the World Trade Center bombing, that the former police cadet ""has been mentioned as a possible replacement"" for the FBI under then-President Bill Clinton.

Kelly didn't become FBI director. That job went to Louis Freeh.

But the fact he was considered by Clinton, a Democrat, gets to one of Kelly's strongest suits: Possible bipartisan support.

Kelly held two jobs under Clinton: Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at Treasury and Commissioner of the United States Customs service.

And he has deep law enforcement credentials: He served a NYPD commissioner for 13 years, longer than anyone in history.

John Pistole

Pistole, currently the president of Anderson University in Indiana, is another example of someone who could curry bipartisan support.

Pistole, who last served as the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration under President Barack Obama, also served as deputy director of the FBI under former president George W. Bush.

He joined the FBI in 1983, serving at the bureau for 26 years until he was confirmed as TSA head in July 2010. While at the FBI he also worked at the bureau's Executive Assistant Director for national security.

Pistole would be a more establishment pick, given his work on terrorism policy during both the Bush and Obama administrations.

Unlike other options on this list, it is unclear whether Pistole backed a presidential candidate in 2016.

The former TSA head has commented on some Trump policies, though.

After Trump planned to cut the ""armed pilot"" program, training that was developed after 9/11 to prepare pilots and crew for a highjacking scenario, Pistole told The Washington Post that he disagreed.

""If you were on one of the four hijacked planes on 9/11, you'd sure say it was important,"" he said. ""To me, it's a relatively small investment for the potential for the risk-mitigation value. It's all about how much risk do you want to take on. I would advocate for a reduction in that program but not elimination.""

Andrew McCabe

McCabe would likely be the easiest pick, given he is currently working at the acting director of the FBI and had served as Comey's deputy since early February 2016.

He joined the FBI as a special agent in 1996 and has since worked in on a host of issues, including counterterrorism, national security and interrogation.

McCabe's biggest drawback could be his connection to Comey and the fact that he had his hands in both the FBI's investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election and was inside the bureau during the investigation into Clinton's emails, which Trump said in a letter Tuesday led to the FBI directors dismissal.

Trey Gowdy

Picking Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican and former federal prosecutor, would electrify Trump's Republican base.

Almost immediately after Comey's departure went public, right-wing blogs and websites jumped at the chance to push Gowdy, who became a champion of the right when he led the committee looking into Clinton's handling of the 2012 Benghazi attack.

Several blogs even started petitions urging Trump to appoint Gowdy director of the FBI.

Gowdy was critical of Comey's decision not to prosecute Clinton over her use of a private email server, but said in the wake of his firing that the former FBI director ""had a very difficult job.""

Like Giuliani and Christie, it would be difficult for Trump to confirm Gowdy, given his clear partisan bent and the fact he endorsed the President during the 2016 Republican primary.",cnn
6,Firing James Comey is Donald Trump's most unpredictable and dangerous move yet,"(CNN) James Comey found out he had been fired as FBI director just like the rest of us: By watching it on television.

The move, announced late Tuesday via a letter sent from President Donald Trump to Comey, marked the most unpredictable moment of a presidency that through its first 100-plus days has been the least orthodox in memory. It also ramped up criticism of Trump's judgments -- Comey was tasked with leading the investigation into Russia's meddling into the 2016 campaign and what, if any, collusion had occurred between Trump campaign operatives and Russian intelligence officials -- and left official Washington reeling over a move considered unthinkable as recently as this week.

The explanation for the move, which emerged into the stunned silence it caused, made little logical sense. A report from deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein highlighted Comey's handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server as the main reason for his dismissal. Rosenstein accused Comey of an attempt to ""usurp"" the power of the attorney general by announcing publicly that he didn't believe any charges should be brought against Clinton in a July 5, 2016 press conference.

JUST WATCHED Who is James Comey? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is James Comey? 01:05

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein added. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

That echoes criticism launched by Democrats loyal to Clinton, who insisted that Comey's decision to offer his own unvarnished view of Clinton's conduct vis-a-vis her private email server -- he said she had been ""extremely careless"" -- went well beyond his proscribed duties.",cnn
6,"Post-Comey: 3 ways to investigate the Trump campaign and Russia, explained","President Donald Trump's stunning firing of FBI Director James Comey Tuesday triggered renewed demands from lawmakers, former government officials and watchdog groups for an ""independent"" investigation into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

For months, some have argued for the appointment of a "" special"" counsel or prosecutor , while others want to form a congressional "" select committee ,"" and a third group suggests launching a new bipartisan commission . While none of these options are mutually exclusive, there are, however, significant differences in the purpose, scope and viability of these approaches.

Here's a breakdown of the various paths available and how they differ:

Special counsel

Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided in March to recuse himself from any existing or future investigations related to Trump's presidential campaign ( or transition ) after reports surfaced that Sessions had met with a Russian diplomat last year. As a result of Sessions' recusal, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is now overseeing the FBI's investigation into whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian interference in election.

The attorney general's regulations provide for appointment of outside "" special counsel "" in certain circumstances, including if handling by the Justice Department would ""present a conflict of interest for the department or other extraordinary circumstances,"" and if ""it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside special counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.""

In light of Sessions' recusal, however, the decision to appoint a special counsel in this case will rest solely with Rosenstein.

And while lawmakers on Capitol Hill have no role in the appointment of any special counsel, that hasn't stopped top Democratic leadership from putting pressure on Rosenstein to appoint someone else in his place.

""Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein sat in the Judiciary Committee and promised to appoint a special prosecutor at the appropriate time,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday. ""That time is right now. The American people's trust in our criminal justice system is in Rosenstein's hands. Mr. Rosenstein, America depends on you to restore faith in our criminal justice system, which is going to be badly shattered after the administration's actions today.""

Experts say the main purpose of a special counsel in the Russia situation would be the pursuit of an independently driven criminal investigation.

""They can utilize a grand jury, they can ask to return indictments, they would be empowered to pick staff (of their choosing), and provided with a budget to carry out responsibilities,"" said attorney Richard Ben-Veniste, who served as the former chief of the Watergate Special Prosecutor's Watergate Task Force and on the bipartisan 9/11 Commission.

In other words, the goal of an investigation conducted by a special counsel ""is not to answer public questions about what happened or what may still be happening,"" as Wittes wrote in a post on Lawfare , but rather to conduct ""a set of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence investigations that may (or may not) have criminal investigative elements.""

JUST WATCHED Fallon calling for special counsel at DOJ Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Fallon calling for special counsel at DOJ 01:25

Select committee

While a number of House and Senate committees are currently examining Russian interference in the election, Arizona Sen. John McCain and other outside experts have specifically called for a ""select committee,"" with new members hand-picked by current congressional leadership.

In the immediate aftermath of Comey's firing, such calls grew louder.

""I have long called for a special congressional committee to investigate Russia's interference in the 2016 election,"" McCain said in a statement Tuesday. ""The President's decision to remove the FBI Director only confirms the need and the urgency of such a committee.""

Advantages of using such a select committee include newly dedicated staff with sufficient expertise and time, subpoena power to compel testimony and documents, and ideally, implementation without the arguable taint of influence by the White House -- an accusation that has besieged existing structures like the House intelligence committee's investigation.

While both a special counsel and a select committee could employ certain investigative functions, Wittes cautions that they serve different purposes: The special prosecutor function is ""designed to prosecute crimes,"" whereas a select committee is ""designed to do an investigation so that Congress would know how to pursue it's constitutional functions.""

But Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society, said the choice between a special counsel and a select committee ""shouldn't be either/or,"" despite the fact that ""there are somewhat different interests being protected"" -- both approaches are useful ""given that the stakes are so high here.""

JUST WATCHED Castro: Comey firing 'extremely suspicious' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Castro: Comey firing 'extremely suspicious' 03:42

Bipartisan commission

On the other end of the spectrum, some have called for a new bipartisan independent commission to investigate Russia's influence on the election, much in the same vein as the 9/11 Commission.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who sits on the House intelligence committee, accused the White House in March of ""obstructing"" the panel's investigation, and called repeatedly for an independent commission to review the matter.

The @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse is obstructing Congress's #RussianHacking investigation. Ind. Commission is only path to find the truth. https://t.co/TNa370VdT2 — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) March 27, 2017

The purpose of such a commission is distinct from a criminal investigation, as its goal would be ""inform the legislature or the public about something that happened,"" Wittes said. ""The purpose of the 9/11 Commission was to tell the story of how we got to this point.""

""The advantage is that it's flashy and very independent,"" but it's ""not well-positioned to litigate"" without certain investigative powers, Wittes added.

The other downside of an independent commission is that it would require legislation to enact, which could prove challenging in the current political climate.

If used, ""it would no doubt be the result of substantial public pressure on Congress and the President, but it seems unlikely at this point,"" Ben-Veniste said.",cnn

Democratic and Republican lawmakers will be ""thanking"" Donald Trump for firing FBI director James Comey, the president has said.

In early morning tweets, Mr Trump defended his shock decision to fire the FBI chief over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails.

His comments come just before he is set to meet the Russia's foreign minister.

Mr Comey was leading an FBI investigation into alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

""James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI,"" Mr Trump said in defending his decision on Wednesday.

""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"" he added.

The president and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are scheduled to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday morning.

The White House shocked Washington and Democrats were quick to link the firing of Mr Comey to the Russia investigation.

It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired.

Why was James Comey fired?

President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that ""you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau"".

Mr Sessions said the department of justice was ""committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law"", and ""a fresh start is needed"".

Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the investigation into Mrs Clinton's emails, given that Mr Trump once praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.

In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump told a rally it ""took guts"" for Mr Comey to reopen the inquiry. ""What he did brought back his reputation,"" Mr Trump said.

But on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he ""cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [of State Hillary] Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken"".

""Almost everyone agrees the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.""

Mr Rosenstein also said:

Mr Comey had been wrong to ""usurp"" the previous attorney general in July 2016 when he announced the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution

That he had compounded his error by ""gratuitously"" releasing ""derogatory information"" about Mrs Clinton

Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when, according to US media, he learned he had just been fired when he saw the news on television.

The 56-year-old - who was three-and-a-half years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank.

What about the Russia investigation?

Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.

The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are looking into the same allegations but no conclusions have yet been reached.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference.

""This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" he added.

A cover-up? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump and senior justice department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support.

Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree.

How did Comey handle the email inquiry?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Comey explains why he went public reopening Clinton email probe

Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.

The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.

He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.

What was Clinton FBI probe about?

He told the Senate last week it had made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again. Mrs Clinton lays part of the blame for her shock election defeat last November on Mr Comey.

He told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails, ""some of which contain classified information"", to her husband.

But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had sent only two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing.

Watergate 2.0?

Image copyright AP Image caption Nixon became the only US president to resign from the job

In June 1972, five men were arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) at the Watergate office and hotel complex in Washington. The break-in was traced to President Richard Nixon's supporters.

The firing of James Comey is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when Mr Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the break-in and the subsequent cover-up.

""Not since Watergate has a president dismissed the person leading an investigation bearing on him,"" the New York Times wrote late on Tuesday.

Mr Nixon later admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry. He later became the only US president to resign.

It was alleged the party spent tens of thousands of pounds on local campaigns - including on ""battle bus"" visits by activists - which were either not declared or were wrongly registered as national spending.

Under complex election spending rules, parties must disclose national spending separately from money used to promote each candidate, and separate national and local limits apply.

In March the Tories were fined a record £70,000 by the Electoral Commission, which criticised the party for resisting its investigation although it was unable to prove any intention to make false declarations.

But following a lengthy investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service said it would take no further action against either candidates or party officials.

It said a file from Kent Police on the South Thanet campaign was recently received and was ""under consideration"", adding that nothing should be inferred from the fact that its inquiries were continuing.

A decision on whether to bring charges is likely to be made before the General Election, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw understands.

'Insufficient evidence'

In a statement, the CPS said it was an offence to knowingly make a false declaration but in order to bring charges it must be proved that suspects knew the return was inaccurate and acted dishonestly in signing the declaration.

""Although there is evidence to suggest the returns may have been inaccurate, there is insufficient evidence to prove to the criminal standard that any candidate or agent was dishonest,"" said its head of special crime Nick Vamos.

Submitting inaccurate returns relating to battle bus spending was a ""technical offence"", Mr Vamos said, but he did not believe in the circumstances it was in the public interest to bring charges against individuals.

Speaking at an event in Nottingham, Prime Minister Theresa May said the Tories had believed all along local expenses had been properly reported and declared.

All the major parties had been fined for mistakes on national expenses, she said. ""We've paid our fines, and I sincerely hope the other parties are paying theirs.""

Conservative Party chairman Patrick McLoughlin said the party regretted the police had become involved.

""These were politically motivated and unfounded complaints that have wasted police time,"" he said.

The Electoral Commission said the CPS's findings were consistent with its own investigation, which had found the Conservative's spending return was incomplete and inaccurate.

The allegations came to light following an investigation by Channel 4 News and the Daily Mirror.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""surprised"" by the ruling and would ""look into the details"". While he respected the independence of the Crown Prosecution Service, he said the electoral laws had to be adhered to and enforced.

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the Tories had ""driven a battle bus and horses"" through the spirit of the law.

One Conservative MP investigated by the police, Karl McCartney, called on senior officials at the Electoral Commission to resign.

Describing the watchdog as ""unfit for purpose"", Mr McCartney - who is seeking re-election in Lincoln - said unless senior figures took responsibility he would campaign for the quango's abolition after the general election.",bbc-news

6,Analysis: Donald Trump's decision to fire James Comey means the campaign won't end,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The White House reports Comey's dismissal comes after he was found in the middle of several political controversies like Russia's possible election interference and Hillary Clinton's handling of classified e-mails. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — The 2016 campaign apparently isn't over yet.

Six months after Election Day, President Trump's stunning decision to fire FBI Director James Comey thrust questions about the campaign that put Trump in the White House back at center stage. Democrats and a handful of Republicans are pressing demands that a special prosecutor be appointed to pursue an independent investigation into Russian meddling in the election, including whether Trump associates colluded with them.

Now the issue of what Moscow did and who may have helped — for months an annoying background noise for Trump — has become the loudest clamor in the capital. The president's action, taken after tweets dismissing the investigation and demanding it be shut down, has ignited a firestorm of criticism, drawn comparisons to Richard Nixon, and sparked talk of a constitutional crisis. At least for now, it is likely to complicate and delay the administration's governing agenda, from health care to tax cuts.

5 key points in memo calling for FBI Director James Comey's firing

Clinton officials respond to Comey firing with suspicion, not satisfaction

Analysis: James Comey's firing won't end election controversy over Russia

What it will not do is squelch the appetite for investigation.

If anything, scrutiny now expands to include the decision to fire Comey. And critics note that Trump already has fired two other officials who happened to be involved in potentially troublesome investigations — former acting attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover who had reported concerns about Flynn to the Trump White House, and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, another holdover whose investigations touched Trump associates.

""EVERYONE who cares about independence & rule of law in America should be ""troubled by the timing and reasoning"" of Comey firing. Period,"" Bharara tweeted Tuesday night. He was quoting Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C.

The fury of the reaction seemed to surprise the White House, given Democrats' criticism of Comey for his public accounts of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of State. Clinton herself last week blamed Comey and the Russians for costing her the White House.

After Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters he wondered whether investigations into the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia were ""getting too close for the president,"" Trump derided him as ""Cryin' Chuck Schumer.""

""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"" he tweeted Wednesday morning. He retweeted a link to a Drudge Report story headlined, ""10 SCANDALS ON DIRECTOR'S WATCH."" The president predicted that ""Republican and Democrat alike"" eventually ""will be thanking me.""

Still, in one more sign that the White House may be misjudging the optics involved, the president was scheduled to meet at the White House Wednesday morning with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

""It's time to move on,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Fox News.

That's not likely to happen.

After the rockiest opening months of any modern president, and the lowest approval ratings, Trump on Day 110 created his biggest controversy to date. Comey is just the second FBI director ever to be fired. (William Sessions was the first, ousted by Bill Clinton after allegations of financial improprieties.) Trump is the first president to fire a law-enforcement official investigating him since Richard Nixon ordered aides to fire Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor.

""Nixon, in his memoirs, said that the 'firestorm' that met the Saturday Night Massacre was the first glimpse that he had of how the acid of Watergate had eaten away at his presidency, and eroded his powers,"" says John Farrell, author of an acclaimed new biography, Nixon: A Life. ""It is conceivable that Americans have become so cynical as to shrug all this off, as Trump hopes, but I tend to believe that this ongoing drip, drip, drip will have a corrosive effect on the Trump presidency, similar to that of Watergate on Nixon.""

In 1974, Nixon would resign in the face of impeachment. The Nixon Library and Museum posted a wry tweet Tuesday night: ""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian.""

WASHINGTON — As calls for an independent prosecutor intensify on both sides of the aisle, President Trump and aides argued Wednesday that the firing of FBI Director James Comey had nothing to do with the agency's ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.

""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"" Trump tweeted.

The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, speaking on MSNBC's Morning Joe and other television news programs, said the FBI director's overall record subjected him to dismissal. Sanders cited the recommendations of Justice Department leaders who said Comey had lost his effectiveness as the bureau's leader — in part because of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

Comey announced just 11 days before the November presidential election that he was reopening the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. As Sanders noted in her interview defending the firing, many Democrats blamed for her loss to Trump in the November election.

Stressing the Trump administration has no plans to get involved in FBI business, Sanders said the Russia investigations will ""continue whether Jim Comey is there or not.""

That did little to assuage the concerns of Democrats, who united in their calls for the appointment of a special prosecutor in the Russia probe — and even some Republicans on Wednesday began to broach the idea.

5 key points in memo calling for FBI Director James Comey's firing

James Comey's firing won't end election controversy over Russia

Disputing Trump's reasoning on the timing, Democrats insisted that Trump could have fired Comey over his handling of the Clinton investigation anytime during the past four months he's been in office. Instead, they said, the president waited until the various Russia investigations heated up. ""He feels the noose tightening,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, also speaking on Morning Joe.

Kaine noted that, in Trump's termination letter to Comey, the president thanked the FBI director for ""you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

As Kaine put it: ""That shows a deeply insecure president.""

As many Democrats described the Comey dismissal as ""Nixonian,"" in reference to President Richard Nixon's firing of the Watergate special prosecutor in 1973, there could be some Republican support for an independent investigation. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., told MSNBC that Comey's firing makes it ""hard to resist"" calls for a special prosecutor. ""It's pretty tough to fire the guy who's investigating your campaign,"" Dent said.

Other Republicans joined in the criticism of the timing of Trump's stunning move.

Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., heading up one of the investigations as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he is ""troubled by the timing and reasoning"" of Comey's firing. He added that it ""further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.""

Trump, of course, doesn't see it that way. During his morning tweet storm, Trump said that ""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!""

Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

The president said he will hire someone ""who will do a far better job"" in restoring the FBI's prestige.

The new director will inherit an ongoing investigation into whether there was any collusion between associates of the Trump campaign and Russian who sought to influence last year's election by hacking Democrats close to Clinton and releasing the stolen information to websites such as WikiLeaks.

The investigation focuses on whether there are any Russian links to Trump associates Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager; Carter Page, a member of a Trump foreign policy advisory board; and Roger Stone, a long-time friend and political adviser to Trump.

Manafort, Page, and Stone have all denied collusion with Russia during the 2016 election.

Trump's decision to fire Comey comes amid a flood of news about the Russia investigation. On Monday, Sally Yates, the acting attorney general Trump fired earlier in his term, told a Senate panel that she warned the White House that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied about contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and was therefore vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Trump later fired Flynn.

White House officials downplayed the timing of all these developments, however, insisting that the same Democrats condemning the decision have in the past called for Comey's removal over his handling of last year's Clinton email investigation.

In the report that Trump used to justify his decision, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein criticized Comey for holding a July 5 news conference to announce that charges would not be filed against Clinton, even as he criticized her over the handling of classified information. “We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein said. His letter recommending firing also specifically mentioned Comey's decision to announce new investigation in the Clinton investigation on October 28.

Trump, meanwhile, had praised Comey for re-opening the investigation in October – and has in the months since complimented the FBI director. Introducing Comey during a White House event in January, Trump said that ""he's become more famous than me.""

At the White House, Trump's relatively light public schedule guarantees that questions about Russia will continue to be front and center.

The president is scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. It's the only event on his public schedule so far.

After a State Department meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Lavrov laughed off questions about the Comey firing and the Russia investigation.

""Was he fired?"" Lavrov told reporters. ""You're kidding? You're kidding?""

The White House says it will begin the search for a new FBI Director immediately. (May 10) AP

The larger question is whether we are officially turning into a banana republic.

President Trump is always transparent in his peculiar way. Even as he lies baldly, he reveals what is on the forefront of his mind. So it is in the brutal letter he had a top personal aide hand deliver to the FBI, firing director James Comey: “While I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau.”



Of course, we do not know if Trump is or is not under investigation. We certainly cannot take Trump’s word for it. We do know for a fact that the FBI is looking into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible involvement — links, coordination, collusion — by Trump aides and associates. By pushing Comey out the door, and doing so on the preposterous pretext that the FBI director mishandled the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server last July 5, Trump has plunged the country into nothing less than a constitutional crisis. How it is resolved will have profound implications for our future.



An obvious and key question is whether by getting rid of Comey, Trump will succeed in slowing or bringing to a halt the investigative machinery presently in motion. On its face, that seems unlikely. If the workings of the FBI are always a black box, that is especially so for a leaderless bureau, run by a toothless acting director. It is conceivable that Trump’s replacement for Comey, whomever he appoints, will manage to pour sand into the gears. But even if that happens, the bureau is not the only game in town.



The House and Senate investigations have significant limitations. They do not have adequate investigative resources and they have been periodically hamstrung by partisanship. But if the White House is seen to be engaged, as now appears, in a full-throated cover-up, will Republicans let Trump get away with it?

GOP elected officials have been remarkably craven up to this juncture, tolerating behavior in the White House that would have been inconceivable in any previous administration. Will they wake up now, or are they in too deep? Having revealed themselves, with some notable exceptions, to be devoid of principles, the one safe prediction we can make is that they will approach this question not with reference to right and wrong, and not by putting country ahead of party, but by studying the polls.



The larger question raised by the Comey firing is whether the United States is now officially turning into a banana republic. As more and more dots are connected, they are forming an ugly picture. The abrupt firing of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara on March 11 is one such dot. Bharara had been told by Trump in November that he could stay in office. But of course his investigative bailiwick in the Southern District of New York encompassed a location that, as the months went by and as the Russia investigation proceeded, became increasingly sensitive: Trump Tower. Without explanation, Bharara was sacked.



A second is the bizarre White House interference in the House Intelligence Committee investigation, with Chairman Devin Nunes secretly invited to the White House to receive information which he then briefed to President Trump as if he obtained it from somewhere else. That escapade discredited the committee’s work and set it back for weeks. Then we have the efforts of the White House, over several months, to try to block former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates from testifying before Congress on the grounds that it would violate “client confidences.”

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

The stage-managed firing of Comey is the biggest blow of all to the rule of law thus far. Multiple news outlets are reporting that Trump decided to fire Comey sometime last week. He then asked his Attorney General Jeff Sessions to come up with a rationale for such a step. Never mind that this entailed putting the cart before the horse. And never mind that Sessions himself had formally recused himself from matters concerning the Russia investigation that Comey was heading up. This is the same Sessions who lied to the Senate about his own meetings with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and it is the same Sessions who recommended that the Trump campaign bring on board as a foreign policy adviser Carter Page, who is also under FBI investigation for his ties to Russian officials.



No one knows what will come next. But the degree of tumult, dishonesty and corruption is breathtaking. As the Trump administration, in the name of making America great again, drags the country ever deeper into crisis, one can make two safe predictions. First, many more utterly unpredictable things are bound to happen. And second, it will not end well either for Trump or for the country.

The wife of longtime ESPN broadcaster Chris Berman was one of two people killed in a car accident on Tuesday in Connecticut.

The Mercedes driven by Kathy Berman, 69, was struck from behind by a Ford Escape driven by an 89-year-old man in Woodbury at around 2:16 p.m., according to the Connecticut State Police summary of the accident obtained by USA TODAY Sports. The collision sent Berman’s car down an embankment before it overturned into a small body of water.

The Escape hit a utility pole after the initial collision and the driver, Edward Bertulis, died as result of his injuries.

""This is a devastating tragedy and difficult to comprehend,"" ESPN president John Skipper said in a statement. ""Chris is beloved by all his ESPN colleagues and for good reason: He has a huge heart and has given so much to so many over the years. We know how much his family means to him and all we can do at a moment like this is give him the love and support he will surely need at this hour.

Donald Trump gave FBI Director James Comey his walking papers just in time for the late-night comedians to work the news into their opening monologues.

""We'll have more on this tomorrow when they scramble to cover the whole thing up,"" promised Stephen Colbert.

Here are their best jokes on the story so far:

The Late Show With Stephen Colbert

""(The firing) showed no gratitude at all,"" Colbert said at the top of his monologue, just minutes after the story broke Tuesday evening. ""Did Trump forget about the Hillary emails that Comey talked about?""

Launching into his breathy Trump impression, the comedian imagined their parting, saying ""Thanks for the presidency, Jimmy. Now don't let the door hit you where the Electoral College split you.""

Jimmy Kimmel Live!

""A few hours ago (Trump) fired James Comey, the director of the FBI, which is kind of like O.J. firing Judge Ito halfway through the trial,"" the ABC host noted. ""He fired the director of the FBI while the director was investigating the possible collusion with Russia ... This is what dictators do. It's what reality TV stars do. They fire someone every week. Maybe that's what happened. He thinks he's still on The Celebrity Apprentice.""

Kimmel was amused by the reason White House gave for Comey's dismissal: ""It was because he mishandled the Hillary Clinton email situation, which is hilarious because that would mean Trump fired Comey for making him president.""

He also saw the firing as a business opportunity, announcing that he would be selling T-shirts bearing the slogan ""Comey is my homey.""

The Daily Show with Trevor Noah

While The Daily Show's old guard was reuniting on Colbert's show, Noah questioned the legality of Trump's decision. ""You can't just fire the FBI director. If he's gone, who's going to investigate Russia's ties to ... Ohhh.""

He then reminded his audience, ""I know how we said Trump was an African dictator. But right now, even Africans are watching this like, 'Yo, Donald Trump does not (mess) around.'""

He could barely keep a straight face while relating the reason for Comey's ouster. ""This is insane. Hey's basically saying he's doing this because of what Comey did to Hillary. That is the most gangster excuse I've ever heard. Trump is saying, 'I'm doing this to clear my good friend, 'Crooked Hillary' because James Comey just wanted to lock her up, lock her up, lock her up.'""

9,Aaron Hernandez's first days in prison trouble-filled as he vowed to 'run this place',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Judge Susan Garsh explains her decision to vacate the murder conviction against Hernandez, who was serving a life sentence for the murder of Odin Lloyd. USA TODAY Sports

Aaron Hernandez (Photo: Associated Press file photo)

Aaron Hernandez fought, served as a lookout, received a neck tattoo and stole an inmate’s calling card shortly after his arrival in the maximum security Massachusetts prison in April 2015.

The disciplinary records obtained by USA TODAY Sports from the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, the same facility where he was found hanged last month, show 25 alleged violations over an eight-day span in May 2015, shortly after he was convicted of murdering Odin Lloyd.

“You ain’t got (expletive) on me (expletive),” Hernandez told corrections officer after his first prison fight. “You just making up (expletive).

Hernandez was checked out by medical personnel and put in restrictive confinement when he continued his verbal barrage.

“This place ain’t (expletive) to me,” Hernandez said. “I’ll run this place and keep running (expletive). Prison aint (expletive) to me.”

Hernandez had a total of 78 disciplinary offenses spread across 12 incidents during his nearly two years at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, the majority of which took place during his first three months at the facility in Shirley, Mass.

""When people first enter custody, they need to make their bones,"" Larry Levine, the founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants who served 10 years in a federal prison, told USA TODAY Sports. ""They need to create a reputation that will carry them through their time in custody. Hernandez was probably being tested by the other inmate. By becoming a management and disciplinary problem, he showed that he was willing to stand up to staff and the inmate population, potentially anyone who got in his way.""

At the disciplinary hearings that followed, Hernandez either pled guilty or was found guilty by a hearing officer of 14 charges.

None of the incidents were forwarded to prosecutors.

Hernandez fought three times, according to the prison records. Levine, however, said the fact Hernandez served as a lookout early in his stint was just as noteworthy.

""No one in any prison respects a rat,"" Levine said. ""By acting as a lookout, he was tested to see if he could keep his mouth shut and be trusted. ""

One of the more serious altercations came in August 2015 after a new inmate attempted to shake Hernandez’s hand.

“Hernandez struck (name redacted) with a closed fist to the face and both men engage (sic) in a physical altercation,” a corrections officer wrote in the report of the incident. “The combatants ignored several direct orders to cease their actions and chemical agent was utilized to separate the inmates.”

Both Hernandez and the other inmate were put in segregation afterward.

Hernandez closed out 2015 with his ninth incident that year: possession of a weapon that was discovered in a search of his cell on Dec. 3. Corrections officers found a nearly six-inch piece of metal that had been sharpened into a knife. The weapon had a cloth handle and tether so it could be attached to the wrist.

He received 15 days in solitary confinement ---the maximum allowed under state guidelines --- and he lost access to the facility’s canteen, the prison equivalent to a general store, for 90 days.

Hernandez had only three other incidents during his stay at the prison, a stretch broken up by his trial on double-murder charges. After he was acquitted at that trial in April, he returned to the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center where he resumed serving his life sentence for the 2013 murder of Lloyd.

There were no documented infractions since October 2016 when Hernandez was found to have locked himself in the cell with another inmate, something not permitted under prison guidelines because it “disrupts the normal operation of the facility.”

The last time corrections officers responded to his cell was in the early hours of April 19 as he was found hanged with a bedsheet. His death at age 27 was ruled a suicide days later.",usa-today

9,How good is Kylian Mbappe? The teenager just spent 180 minutes torching the best defense in the world | FOX Sports,"What is Kylian Mbappe’s ceiling? Right now it’s looking to be somewhere between Thierry Henry and the Archangel Michael, but honestly there’s no telling just how good this kid can be.

We’re fresh off seeing an 18-year-old manchild terrorize one of the best defenses in European history. For 180 minutes, Mbappe put the fear of god into the Juventus back line, culminating in the goal that ended Juve’s historic scoreless streak. The Bianconeri had stood firm for 690 minutes, seeing off the likes of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar, and they’d even made it look easy.

Until they met Kylian Mbappe.

Monaco’s crown jewel was a problem for the Bianconeri from start to finish, with the wiry attacker showcasing every single tool in his extensive kit. It wasn’t just his eye-popping pace to get in behind, or his mesmerizing skill with the ball at his feet that gave the Juventus defense fits, but his understanding of the ebbs and flows of the game, and ability to consistently find pockets of space in dangerous areas made life hell for the Bianconeri. There was no hyperbole about it. He was a monster, and it went well beyond just physical skills.

Over two legs, Mbappe was the most constant and terrifying threat Juventus have seen this year.

Juventus’ defense were well aware of Mbappe’s danger before the match, and legendary goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon gave him high praise before their first meeting, calling him an “incredible talent” and a “good kid.”

“Of course, the characteristics are similar [between he and Thierry Henry] – he plays for Monaco early in his career, the very slender and elegant running style,” Buffon told UEFA’s website.

“Probably, at this age, he is even better in front of goal than Henry was.”

Thierry Henry comparisons have become standard for Mbappe, and his ability to somehow exceed those expectations has become even more standard. Buffon was right to be wary, and the Frenchman gave the goalkeeper plenty of problems. He tested him a number of times in the first leg, bringing the very best out of the old man in the Old Lady’s goal, and was finally able to put one past the 39-year-old Italy legend with a nice finish in the 69th minute of the second match. It wasn’t enough to help Monaco progress past Juventus, but it was more than deserved for the effort he put in over two legs.

Mbappe’s goal was well earned, and it was the perfect showcase of just how diverse his talent is. Throughout the tie, and throughout this entire season, he’s shown his physical capabilities: There aren’t many athletes in the game who can keep up with him in a footrace. He’s showed off his silky smooth dribbling skills time and time again, twisting and turning defenders inside and out all through the season. He even managed to put Juventus’ best one-on-one defender Andrea Barzagli in a blender, joining an extremely exclusive list of Very Saucy Individuals.

But it wasn’t his athleticism or dribbling ability that got him on the scoresheet, it was his preternatural off-the-ball movement and timing inside the box. It was his understanding of where to be, and the determination to shrug off the attentions of Alex Sandro so he could ghost in and side-foot home Monaco’s only goal.

At basically a standstill, in tight quarters with the best defenders in the world looking for him, Mbappe still managed to get free. That has nothing to do with athleticism — it’s all instinct, intelligence and perfect timing. Whereas some youngsters can shine early on because of their physical gifts, Mbappe is well beyond that. And he has those physical gifts.

Barzagli himself was effusive in his praise for the young Frenchman after the first leg matchup, raving about the completeness of his game.

“We studied Mbappe, he is a devastating player,” said Barzagli. I’ve met some over the years, but at his age with that technique, physical strength pace, and above all his movements, because he changes things up and makes excellent movements off the ball. I’ve not seen someone like him.”

Ostensibly a central striker, Mbappe has drawn comparisons to Henry mainly because of that movement. Tall, with a string bean figure, Mbappe isn’t physically strong enough yet to regularly throw bodies around with burly center backs, but his sweeping runs through the center out to the wings cause devastation because of the way he’s able to pull central players wide, creating space for himself and his teammates. While Henry often favored drifting to the left wing in order to cut inside and have a shot on his stronger right foot, so far Mbappe’s shown he’s equally comfortable taking on players down the right wing as he is mirroring his predecessor down the left. A consummate team player, the teenager is just as likely to beat his defender to the end line and put in a tantalizing cross as he is to skate past his marker and force a shot on goal.

Even though he prefers drifting wide, part of Mbappe’s terrifying versatility is his efficacy through the middle, too. He’s more than capable of holding the ball up in the middle if necessary, joining in combination play with his strike partner Falcao, and working intricate one-twos with the creative midfielders behind him, or checking in deep only to spin and get in behind into the space he’s just created for himself. Despite his young age, he already seems to have the full bag of striker’s tricks, and it looks like he’s adding more to his repertoire with every match.

Wonderkids come along every single year, and the vast majority of them flame out rather than becoming legitimate stars. Every once in a while a player shows up who looks almost predestined for greatness though, and that aura is shining all over Mbappe.

It’s too early to call him a superstar yet, but there’s no doubting the fact that if he had a walk-up song, it’d be Lil Wayne’s “No Ceilings.”",fox-sports
9,Martin Truex Jr. will debut new No. 78 paint scheme at Kansas | FOX Sports,"Martin Truex Jr. heads to Kansas Speedway this weekend sitting second in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series driver points standings.

He’ll also arrive with a new paint scheme for his No. 78 Furniture Row Racing Toyota, courtesy of sponsor Auto-Owners Insurance. It will be the first of six races this season with Auto-Owners as his primary sponsor on the car, and Truex is hoping it will help change his luck at the 1.5-mile track where he has yet to win in 17 career starts.

That includes some races there recently where he’s suffered some bad luck — none worse than in last year’s spring event when he started from the pole and led a race-high 172 laps, but finished 14th. He also led 95 laps in the 2015 spring race at Kansas, only to finish ninth.

“No matter how many heartbreaks we’ve had at Kansas, I have all the confidence that our team will provide me with another fast race car and we will once again be competing for the win,” Truex said in a team release. “I am excited about having our car with the Auto-Owners Insurance colors for the first time this season. We had good runs last year with the blue Auto-Owners Toyota, including a victory at the Southern 500 (Darlington, S.C.).”

Truex already owns one win this season, going to Victory Lane at Kansas. He also has the most stage wins in the Cup Series with five, is second in stage points earned (124) and second in playoff bonus points earned (10).

In the first nine races of the season, he’s earned two top-five and six top-10 finishes while leading a total of 432 laps. Obviously, he’s looking to add to those impressive totals in the car featuring the paint scheme below.

9,NFL hires Dean Blandino's replacement as VP of officiating | FOX Sports,"The NFL announced Wednesday that Alberto Riveron will take over as the league’s senior vice president of officiating. The job was previously held by Dean Blandino (pictured), who stepped down last month to pursue other opportunities.

In addition to hiring Riveron, Russell Yurk was named vice president of instant replay. In that role, he will “direct the league’s instant replay operations in the Art McNally GameDay Central room and oversee all instant replay-related personnel.”

Riveron has 40 years of officiating experience, beginning in 1977 as an official in local youth leagues. He then transitioned to the collegiate level in 1990 before joining the NFL in 2003. In 2008, he became the NFL’s first Hispanic referee.

“Al has done a terrific job as a key member of our officiating staff for the past four seasons,” Roger Goodell said in a statement. “Prior to that, Al was an outstanding on-field official who earned the respect of his fellow officials, as well as coaches and players alike. To have Al leading our officiating department, and then to add talented, knowledgeable instant replay and officiating experts like Russell and Wayne, is a tremendous positive for us as we look forward to the 2017 season.”

Yurk has 10 years of experience as an official at the high school and collegiate level and has spent the last seven years in the NFL’s replay department. The team of Riveron, Yurk and Wayne Mackie will have the final say on all replay decisions, along with the consultation of referees.

The NFL is moving to a more centralized replay procedure this season, which should hopefully speed up the process.",fox-sports

9,Juventus will have to win the Champions League to finally get the credit they deserve | FOX Sports,"Juventus are en route to a sixth straight Serie A title. And while they are also into second Champions League final in three years, they still can’t get people to call them one of Europe’s best teams.

The rarified air of European elites is still reserved for Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Even Chelsea and the Manchester clubs will get more love than Juventus.

After all, critics will say, “Serie A is weak.” And even as Juventus were rolling to a dominant first leg win in the Champions League semifinals, “they were lucky to draw Monaco.”

Those statements are both true. Serie A is weak and they were lucky to draw Monaco in the semifinals (the alternatives were Real Madrid and Atletico Madric), but that doesn’t make Juventus any less brilliant. They’re not knocks on The Old Lady, simply statements of facts like this one — Juventus are nothing short of brilliant and maybe even the best team in the entire world.

Consider: The Old Lady are nearly into their second Champions League final since Bayern last played in one, just toppled Barcelona, 3-0, in dominating fashion to make the semifinals, and dispatched Real Madrid in the semifinals two years ago to make that final.

If there is a holy trinity of clubs right now — Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich — then where do you put the team that has gotten the better of all three just since 2015?

Most incredibly, Juventus haven’t done it with one special group of players. After all, we’ve seen everything come together for a club, vaulting them into the upper echelon until they’re sold off and the team goes back to mediocrity. They were the team of Paul Pogba, Arturo Vidal and Andrea Pirlo, but they’re all gone and now they’re the team of Paulo Dybala and Miralem Pjanic, with the ability to spend absurd money on Gonzalo Higuain to fill their lone hole up top in front of a defense that went 690 minutes without conceding a single goal.

While you can point at Barcelona’s slow midfield, Real Madrid’s leaky defense and Bayern Munich’s lack of a secondary scoring option to Robert Lewandowski, Juventus are just about flawless. To find a weakness requires calling Mario Mandzukic a striker pushed out wide, even though he’s been terrific there, or saying Pjanic can’t handle the defensive duties asked of him, even though he’s proven (albeit surprisingly) that he absolutely can. Sure Higuain might look a little hefty, but the scale only reads two goals in the first leg of their semifinal tie.

From top to bottom, Juventus are run expertly, featuring world-class players, future stars and established stalwarts, all in a gleaming stadium that is home to one of Europe’s best atmospheres. It will be on display next week when The Old Lady try to book their spot in yet another final. And if they do, the excuses will be trotted out again. They’re good, but not on the level of Europe’s elites, because it’s just Monaco and they have it easy in Serie A.

Even as more people recognize how special Juve are, they’re still shortchanged. Narratives are stubborn that way and there’s nothing fans hate more than opening the doors to an exclusive club. But sports are still a place where trophies are everything and Juventus are 90 minutes from the biggest and most prestigious trophy in club soccer. Win that and the trinity of Europe’s elite will finally and belatedly grow to four, lazy excuses about Serie A or opposition be damned.",fox-sports

6,McConnell: 'Too much is at stake' for new probe,"Story highlights President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday night

The Senate Majority Leader responded to Democrats on Wednesday from the Senate floor

(CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected Wednesday any calls for a new investigation by a special prosecutor into alleged ties between Russia and the Trump campaign in the wake of the President's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.

McConnell said ""too much is at stake"" to halt an investigation already in progress, though some in his own party appear to leave the door open to such a process.

The Kentucky Republican said from the Senate floor such an investigation into Russian meddling into the US election last year would ""only serve to impede the current work being done to not only discover what the Russians may have done but also to let this body and the national security community develop counter measures.""

McConnell was referencing the Senate intelligence committee investigation led by Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.

6,"Trump meets Lavrov, Kislyak at White House","Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak at the White House Wednesday amid the swirling investigation of Russian contacts with Trump campaign and transition officials in 2016 and Tuesday's firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was handling the probe.

Kislyak has been a central figure in the controversy, as then-national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired after it emerged that he had misrepresented conversations with Kislyak to others in the White House. Flynn is now one of the key figures in the investigation.

The Russian Embassy tweeted a photo of Trump shaking the hand of Russia's ambassador in what appears to be the Oval Office. Current and former US intelligence officials have accused Kislyak of being a top spy and recruiter of spies, a notion that Russian officials have dismissed.

The Russian Embassy tweeted the photo as Trump was set to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday. The meeting will be the highest-level encounter between the US administration and Moscow since Trump's inauguration.

Lavrov met first Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to discuss Ukraine, Syria and other bilateral issues, but even their brief appearance before reporters was upstaged by the Comey firing.

After Tillerson briefly welcomed Lavrov and thanked the Russian minister for coming to Washington, a reporter asked if their talks were shadowed by the former FBI director's sudden dismissal.

A visibly irritated Lavrov said, ""Was he fired? You're kidding! You're kidding.""

Lavrov, who has been Russia's top diplomat for more than a decade, was already due to be in town for the meeting with Tillerson before the Trump meeting was announced.

The Lavrov-Tillerson conversation was expected to be ""broad, blunt and businesslike,"" a senior official told CNN ahead of the meeting. With ongoing fighting paralyzing eastern Ukraine, the two foreign ministers were set to discuss the need to fully implement the Minsk ceasefire agreement.

Tillerson was also set to press Lavrov on the need to de-escalate the violence in Syria's civil war, make sure humanitarian assistance was reaching people there and find a political solution to the conflict. The State Department official said it was ""too early to tell"" whether a Russian-backed plan for safe zones inside Syria was viable.

The Trump administration said Comey was fired for mishandling the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of atate, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings.

Alleged ties to Russia

Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates said Monday that she alerted the White House earlier this year that then-Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn could be ""essentially blackmailed by the Russians.""

Her testimony pushed the story of the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia back into the headlines.

In an interview last week, Trump once again refused to blame Russia for attempting to influence the 2016 election through hacking and other means, despite an overwhelming consensus by US law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin also spoke by phone last week about the war in Syria for the first time since Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian government air base last month after an alleged chemical weapons attack by the Syrian regime.

The US missile strike angered Moscow and led Lavrov to declare that ""it's sad how damaging this is to the already bad relations between US and Russia.""

Seasoned diplomat

Since Lavrov's meeting with Trump is closed to the press, few details may emerge of what they discuss. However, its timing -- in the midst of the furor over the Trump administration's firing of Comey -- has raised some eyebrows.

JUST WATCHED Lavrov on U.S. election hacking accusations, Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lavrov on U.S. election hacking accusations, Trump 10:10

Lavrov is a highly experienced diplomat who has served as Russian foreign minister since 2004. Before that, he was Russia's ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 1994 to 2004.

In total, Lavrov, who speaks fluent English, French and Sinhalese according to his foreign ministry biography, has 45 years of diplomatic experience, while his US counterpart Tillerson has just over three months.

The pair's face-to-face meeting Wednesday will focus on ending the fighting in eastern Ukraine and Syria, the US State Department said. It comes ahead of an Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska.

""On Syria, the secretary intends to discuss efforts to de-escalate violence, provide humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and set the stage for a political settlement of the conflict,"" the State Department said in a statement.

Russia, a key backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has taken a central role in ongoing Syria peace talks , while the United States -- which continues to target ISIS in Syria and Iraq as part of an international coalition -- has not been directly involved.

'Reset' of relations?

After meeting with Putin and Lavrov last month in Moscow, Tillerson was blunt about their differences, saying US-Russia relations were ""at a low point, there is a low level of trust between our two countries.""

But Tillerson also offered his Russian counterparts a bridge, tempering the open tensions by urging that Washington and Moscow find ways to cooperate.

Before taking office, Trump touted his intention to improve ties with Moscow. This ambition has been largely derailed, however, by continued questions over his campaign's alleged ties to Russia, accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and the two countries' disagreements over Syria.

In 2009, under then-President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton famously presented Lavrov with a ""reset"" button to symbolically restart US-Russia relations. Unfortunately, instead of ""reset"" the Russian word on the button read ""overcharged.""

Diplomatically, Lavrov said he would keep the button on his desk. The attempt at a reset didn't work and relations between the US and Russia at the end of the Obama administration plunged to Cold War-era lows.",cnn
6,General election 2017: Labour pledge £20bn for English schools,"Image copyright PA Image caption Labour are promising to transform access to lifelong learning

Labour has pledged to invest more than £20bn in schools in England by 2022 by significantly raising business taxes.

It said it would protect real-terms schools funding and cut class sizes for five, six and seven-year olds by hiking corporation tax from 19% to 26%.

The Lib Dems will spend £7bn over the same period to protect cash per pupil, funded by a smaller rise in the tax.

Theresa May said spending was at record levels and 1.8 million more children were in a good or outstanding school.

The prime minister also defended proposed changes to the national funding formula for schools in England, which have caused concerns among some Tory candidates, saying everyone agreed that the existing mechanism was ""unfair"" and needed reform.

BBC education editor Branwen Jeffreys says schools in England have been experiencing a financial squeeze for the first time in 20 years.

Head teachers have been warning about job losses caused by cash shortages, with the National Audit Office estimating schools will have to cut £3bn from budgets by 2019-20 to meet rising cost pressures.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Angela Rayner tells BBC Radio 4's Today Labour will tackle school cash shortages

Launching their plans for a ""national education service"", Labour said they were committed to protecting core schools budgets through a £4.8bn annual real-terms funding increase.

They would also ensure no schools ended up with less cash as a result of the planned national funding shake-up by making available £335m of extra money a year for those affected.

Their other proposals include:

£1.9bn for skills and free ""lifelong education""

£582m to restore the Educational Maintenance Allowance

Free school meals for primary schools

£1.8bn on bringing back student maintenance grants

Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner told BBC Breakfast the Conservatives had ""broken their contract"" with the public over funding and grammar school expansion, to the point that some schools were having to let teachers and teaching assistants go.

""I want to reassure parents up and down the country that my priority is that our education system will be fully funded,"" she said.

She said this ""transformative"" change would mean anyone who wanted to re-train, for example, as a nurse would be able to do so.

Asked about Labour's policy on student tuition fees - after footage emerged of shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying last month that Labour would scrap them - she told BBC Radio 4's Today ""watch this space"".

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that Labour's combined pledges so far amount to £8.4bn in extra spending a year by 2022, compared with that envisaged by the Conservatives.

The think tank has calculated that raising corporation tax to 26% - which would return the headline rate to its 2011 level - could raise at least £19bn a year in the short term but that the yields could reduce over time as the move could affect business investment.

The Lib Dems claimed their own plans went further than Labour's and were more financially credible.

Leader Tim Farron said his party would raise corporation tax to 20% and abolish the married couples tax allowance, which has been in force since 2015. The rest of the funding would come from the £100bn in revenue he said the UK would hold onto by opting to stay in the EU's internal market.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tim Farron said schools were having to lay off teachers

Pressed on how he could guarantee this given the Tories want to leave the single market and the Lib Dems have ruled out a post-election coalition with Labour, he told BBC Radio 4's Today that ""setting out your priorities is incredibly important"".

""It is desperately needed... We are going to see over the next three years £3bn taken out of schools. Two thirds of schools in Britain will be sacking at least one teacher before the start of the academic year and that is because the Conservatives have chosen priorities which are wrong.""

The Conservatives said Labour had already set aside the proceeds of the corporation tax rise to other projects and were also going back on a commitment not to increase the rate for small business - now mooted to go up to 21% by 2020-21.

Speaking in Nottinghamshire, Mrs May said the Conservatives were making their own funding guarantees - such as protecting the £2.5bn pupil premium for disadvantaged families - but that it wasn't simply a question of extra resources.

""It is about the results you see and the education you are providing for the children,"" she said. ""We want to ensure every child gets a good start in life and that is why what we are proposing is a good school place for every single child.""

The Green Party of England and Wales warned against ""pumping more money into a broken system"".

""We would bring free schools and academies back under the control of local authorities so they can be held to account and get rid of the relentless and counter-productive testing of teachers and pupils,"" its spokeswoman Vix Lowthion said.

As education is a devolved matter, the pledges relate to England only, and the amount Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receives would be determined by the funding formula.",bbc-news

A reporter was arrested on Tuesday night at the West Virginia Capitol for allegedly causing a disturbance by shouting questions to two Trump aides.

Dan Heyman had asked Health Secretary Tom Price and White House adviser Kellyanne Conway about coverage under the Republican healthcare plan.

The veteran health reporter wanted to know if domestic violence would be covered as a pre-existing condition.

He later said he ""was trying doing my job"". He faces a fine and jail time.

Mr Heyman, who works for the Public News Service, spoke to reporters after being released by police.

He said that he had been following the Trump team's entourage through the capitol building while wearing his press badge and a shirt identifying his media outlet.

""He didn't say anything,"" Mr Heyman told reporters about Mr Price's refusal to answer his question.

""So I persisted,"" he added.

Mr Price and Ms Conway were in West Virginia for a conference on the opioid epidemic, and its effect on West Virginia, which has seen more overdoses than any other US state.

""This is my job, this is what I'm supposed to do,"" he said. ""I think it's a question that deserves to be answered. I think it's my job to ask questions and I think it's my job to try to get answers.""

According to a criminal complaint, Mr Heyman was ""aggressively breaching the secret service agents to the point where the agents were forced to remove him a couple of times from the area walking up the hallway in the main building of the Capitol.

""The defendant was causing a disturbance at Ms Conway and Secretary Price.""

He was charged with wilful disruption of government processes.

Mr Heyman retorted that he was in a public space, and had not been warned to step away.

The American Civil Liberties Union has defended Mr Heyman's actions, saying his ""arrest is a blatant attempt to chill an independent, free press. The charges against him are outrageous, and they must be dropped immediately"".

""They [the Trump administration] have shown us every day since Donald Trump took office that they don't care about the First Amendment, or the free press. Today was just another example of that. It's horrifying,"" said ACLU-West Virginia legal director Jamie Lynn Crofts.",bbc-news
3,"Non-EU parents may have EU residence right, ECJ rules","Image copyright AFP Image caption Depriving non-EU citizens of residence rights could indirectly deny EU citizens - their children - of their own rights, the court found

Non-EU citizens may have the right to residence in the EU if their children are EU citizens, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled.

It made the judgement in the case of a woman from Venezuela who had a child with a Dutch citizen from whom she has since legally separated.

She was denied social welfare and child benefit payments by Dutch authorities.

The rights of non-EU citizens in the EU have come to the fore as Britain prepares to negotiate to leave.

The European Union says questions about the status of Britons in the remaining 27 EU countries, and of those countries' nationals in the UK, must be resolved as a priority in negotiations.

The ECJ's ""interference"" in national court judgments about migration was cited by some who advocated for the UK to leave the EU.

Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU

EU demands 'serious UK response' on citizens' rights

Wednesday's ruling concerned a Venezuelan national who came to the Netherlands on a tourist visa.

In 2009, she had a child with a Dutch national with whom she lived in Germany until their separation in 2011, when she and the child left the family home and she became responsible for care of her daughter without support from the father.

But because she did not have a right to residence, Dutch authorities rejected the mother's application for welfare payments.

But the ECJ has now ruled that EU law does not allow a member state to take decisions which block the legal rights of a family member of an EU citizen - in this case, the woman's child, who is a Dutch citizen via her father.

The court argued that any threat to the mother's right to remain in the EU would deprive the child of the ""genuine enjoyment"" of her own rights under European law.

The ruling applies to cases where the child has a relationship of dependency on a parent which means the child would have to leave the territory of the EU if the parent did. That would require assessment of a number of factors including age, the child's development and its emotional ties to each parent.

It is now left to the Dutch courts to make a final decision on the individual case involving the family in the light of the decision handed down by the European judges.

10,Microsoft fully dives into artificial intelligence,"Between Cortana and chatbots, it’s clear Microsoft wants to create smarter interactions between people and their technology. However, the company has never proclaimed its plans to get into full blown artificial intelligence – that is until now.

At its annual Microsoft Build developer conference, the Redmond-based company announced its plans to infuse AI into every product and service it offers including Xbox, Windows, Bing and Office to name a few. The software maker demonstrated how AI can help users present a PowerPoint with real-time translations with its translation API.

In another demonstration, Microsoft combined its AI with a cognitive vision service so players could manipulate a slingshot with a real-sense camera tracking the position of their hands. That might sound an awful lot like Kinect, but the idea here is to build an interactive experience on top of hardware already built into computers.

That’s not the only cognitive service offers, Microsoft announced it has tallied up a total of 29. A few of its latest AI services include Bing Custom Search, Custom Vision Service, Custom Decision Service and a Video Indexer.

As the name might suggest Microsoft Cognitive Services allow programs to look for and analyze data whether it be visual, audio or written.

With this level of machine learning developers can build apps that recognize gestures, translate text in multiple languages, deconstruct video for quicker search, editing and real-time captioning, and even customize data to recognize images to categorize them.

A multi-faceted backbone

Of course the benefits of Microsoft AI is only half the picture. To create this intelligent network, Microsoft is leveraging the power of its cloud computing Azure platform. At the same time Microsoft Graph collates business and user data – with their consent – to drive AI development.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made a joke Wednesday about the firing of FBI Director James Comey during a brief appearance before reporters at the State Department.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson welcomed Lavrov in the Treaty Room, saying he looks forward to continuing a dialogue the two began in Moscow “on a very broad range of topics.”

When a reporter asked if President Trump’s firing of the FBI director Tuesday “cast a shadow on your talks,” Lavrov responded with a joke.

“Was he fired?” Lavrov asked. The reporter answered “yes.” Lavrov continued: “You are kidding. You are kidding.”

He then waived his hand with a nod of his head, and walked away with a smiling Tillerson.

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a video of the exchange on Twitter.

Has the razza del ratto (rat race) got you down? Is life too febbrile (hectic) where you live?



But are you worried you don’t have enough contanti (cash) to live a more peaceful life?

Then you might be interested in the Italian hillside village of Bormida, which is about to offer a payment of €2,000 ($2,175) and rents as low as $50 a month to reverse its declining population.

Bormida, located in the mountainous Liguria region – Genoa, about 50 miles away, is the nearest big city – had declined to 390 residents in 2014, when the current mayor, Daniele Galliano, took office, according to the local Il Secolo XIX newspaper.

Spurred by visions of a ghost town, Galliano began measures to reverse the decay.

Now the population is 394, which may not seem much of a success until you consider that 54 people have either died or moved away against just four births.

""Instead of seeing a heavy demographic deficit, the situation is stable thanks to the initiatives of the municipal administration to encourage those who, by necessity or pleasure, wish to live in a small mountain community like ours,"" Galliano told Il Vostro Giornale, another local publication.

But with only four people added, he decided more-enticing measures were needed, hence the subsidies, which also include a $130-a-month rent for larger homes.

""We couldn't rent them at market value, so we chose a symbolic number and the requests abounded: the important thing was to repopulate the village,"" Galliano told Il Secolo XIX.

According to Britain’s Guardian newspaper, details of the offer still needed to be settled and approved by the local council, Galliano wrote on his Facebook page. But if the proposal is passed, anyone who moves to Bormida will be given €2,000.

You probably won’t be able to spend the money all at once – the “Bor(ing)” in Bormida, which has a population of more than 1,000 in the 1950s, gives a clue as to the pace of its life.

According to Cosmopolitan magazine, the village has one main street, four restaurants (hey, this is Italy), a bed and breakfast and a post office that opens only three days a week. Much of the architecture dates back to 1200s.

“There is nothing much to do here,” Oddone Giuseppe, manager of one of the restaurants, told the Guardian. “But life is so simple and natural, we have forests, goats, the church, and plenty of good food. Life would definitely be free of stress.”

Some people, though, worry that €2,000 won’t go far enough.

“Mr. Mayor, I’m available to move and give up the €2,000,” wrote a Facebook user, Amedeo Alloca, on the mayor’s posting, “but I can’t live off air. I have a family with two small children. If you can guarantee a job, even the most humble one, it wouldn’t be a problem.”

Maybe there’s a job in one of those restaurants.

6,"Comey's dismissal had nothing to do with Russia probe, Trump says","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Democrats are insisting a prosecutor investigate possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia following FBI Director James Comey's firing. Sen. Dick Durbin said he'd await word on if the investigation will continue from the White House. (May 9) AP

WASHINGTON — As calls for an independent prosecutor intensify on both sides of the aisle, President Trump and aides argued Wednesday that the firing of FBI Director James Comey had nothing to do with the agency's ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.

""He wasn't doing a good job,"" Trump told reporters about his reasons for firing Comey. ""Very simply, he was not doing a good job.""

Trump's first in-person remarks about Tuesday's abrupt dismissal came after an Oval Office sit-down with Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov – which only sharpened the debate over the tie between Comey's firing and Russia investigation.

The Comey news did not affect the meeting with Lavrov, Trump said as he sat next to former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that Comey's firing came just days after he requested more funds for the Russia investigation.

That's sure to fire up Democrats, who are already saying Trump is trying to short-circuit the Russia investigation, and have united in their calls for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

As many Democrats described the Comey dismissal as ""Nixonian,"" in reference to President Richard Nixon's firing of the Watergate special prosecutor in 1973, there could be some Republican support for an independent investigation. ""It is now harder to resist calls for an independent investigation,"" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., on MSNBC's Morning Joe. ""It's pretty tough to fire the guy who's investigating your campaign.""

However, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, speaking on MSNBC's Morning Joe and other television news programs, said the FBI director's overall record subjected him to dismissal. Sanders cited the recommendations of Justice Department leaders who said Comey had lost his effectiveness as the bureau's leader — in part because of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

Comey announced just 11 days before the November presidential election that he was reopening the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. As Sanders noted in her interview defending the firing, many Democrats blamed for her loss to Trump in the November election.

Stressing the Trump administration has no plans to get involved in FBI business, Sanders said the Russia investigations will ""continue whether Jim Comey is there or not.""

Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted: ""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!""

The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

Disputing Trump's reasoning on the timing, Democrats insisted that Trump could have fired Comey over his handling of the Clinton investigation anytime during the past four months he's been in office. Instead, they said, the president waited until the various Russia investigations heated up. ""He feels the noose tightening,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, also speaking on Morning Joe.

​Kaine noted that, in Trump's termination letter to Comey, the president thanked the FBI director for ""you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

As Kaine put it: ""That shows a deeply insecure president.""

Other Republicans joined in the criticism of the timing of Trump's stunning move.

Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., heading up one of the investigations as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he is ""troubled by the timing and reasoning"" of Comey's firing. He added that it ""further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.""

Trump, of course, doesn't see it that way. During his morning tweet storm, Trump said that ""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!""

Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

The president said he will hire someone ""who will do a far better job"" in restoring the FBI's prestige.

The new director will inherit an ongoing investigation into whether there was any collusion between associates of the Trump campaign and Russian who sought to influence last year's election by hacking Democrats close to Clinton and releasing the stolen information to websites such as WikiLeaks.

The investigation focuses on whether there are any Russian links to Trump associates Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager; Carter Page, a member of a Trump foreign policy advisory board; and Roger Stone, a long-time friend and political adviser to Trump.

Manafort, Page, and Stone have all denied collusion with Russia during the 2016 election.

Trump's decision to fire Comey comes amid a flood of news about the Russia investigation. On Monday, Sally Yates, the acting attorney general Trump fired earlier in his term, told a Senate panel that she warned the White House that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied about contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and was therefore vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Trump later fired Flynn.

White House officials downplayed the timing of all these developments, however, insisting that the same Democrats condemning the decision have in the past called for Comey's removal over his handling of last year's Clinton email investigation.

In the report that Trump used to justify his decision, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein criticized Comey for holding a July 5 news conference to announce that charges would not be filed against Clinton, even as he criticized her over the handling of classified information. “We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein said. His letter recommending firing also specifically mentioned Comey's decision to announce new investigation in the Clinton investigation on October 28.

Trump, meanwhile, had praised Comey for re-opening the investigation in October – and has in the months since complimented the FBI director. Introducing Comey during a White House event in January, Trump said that ""he's become more famous than me.""

6,Senate blocks move to overturn Obama-era rule on drilling,"In this June 12, 2014, file photo, oil pumps and natural gas burn off in Watford City, N.D. (Photo: Charles Rex Arbogast, AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a surprising win for environmentalists and Democrats and a blow to the fossil-fuel industry, the Senate on Wednesday failed in a bid to reverse an Obama-era regulation restricting harmful methane emissions that escape from oil and gas wells on federal land.

The vote was 51-49 in the Republican-led Senate with three GOP lawmakers — Maine’s Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona — joining forces with the Democrats to block efforts to overturn the rule.

President Obama finalized a rule in November that would force energy companies to capture methane that’s burned off or “flared” at drilling sites because it earns less money than oil.

Energy companies frequently “flare” or burn off vast supplies of methane — the primary component of natural gas — at drilling sites because it earns less money than oil. An estimated $330 million a year in natural gas is wasted through leaks or intentional releases — enough to power about 5 million homes a year.

Gas flaring is so prevalent in oil-rich North Dakota that night-time flaring activity on drilling sites is visible in NASA photos from space.

For months, Republicans have rammed through reversals of rules issued by Obama on gun rights, coal production, hunting and money for family planning clinics. They have used the previously obscure Congressional Review Act, which requires just a simple majority in both chambers to overturn rules imposed recently imposed by the executive branch.

The latest target was the Interior Department rule on methane.

A coalition of groups with ties to the fossil-fuel industry and the conservative Koch Brothers had waged a public campaign to overturn the rule, which they said would decrease energy production on federal lands, raise energy costs and eliminate jobs.

Republicans and industry groups call the rule an example of federal overreach under Obama and say it duplicates state rules in place throughout the West.

Democrats and environmental groups countered that the rule protects the public health and generates millions of dollars in revenue for state, local and tribal governments.

Gleeful Democrats hailed the vote as a breakthrough in the GOP-controlled Congress.

“Today’s vote is a win for American taxpayers, a win for public health and a win for our climate,” said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. “Rejecting this Republican attempt to allow oil and gas companies to continue wasting natural gas owned by the American people will ensure that American taxpayers will not get burned. And it will ensure we don’t lose control of managing methane emissions on public lands that contribute to climate change.”

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s top lobbying group, called the Senate vote disappointing, but said in a statement it looks forward to working with the Trump administration on policies to boost energy production.

Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society, an environmental group that had pushed to defend the Obama rule, said the Senate vote was the result of grass-roots efforts by voters across the country.

“In recent months, thousands of Americans asked the Senate to stand up for clean air and against the oil lobby, and their efforts were successful today,” Williams said.

Such disdain for dogma wasn't exactly new a decade ago; teams had dabbled with small ball here and there for as long as there had been an NBA. Combined with the league's growing affinity for the 3-pointer, though, D'Antoni was on the cusp of a revolution.

As is so often the case when conventional wisdom is overturned, D'Antoni's ideas spread like wildfire.

By 2011, the Dallas Mavericks were using aspects of the Seven Seconds or Less Suns to knock off LeBron James and the Miami Heat, who in turn incorporated small-ball to win two titles, only to be bested by the Spurs, who took D'Antoni's offense to new levels and knocked off The King.",fox-sports

He has good potential, is a year or two away from being a starter, and Manning’s declining play has created some cause for concern in New York.

It seems like the perfect situation for the Giants and Webb, but co-owner John Mara wants everyone to take a step back before handing the rookie anything.

“I think it’s a little premature to be anointing this guy as the heir apparent to Eli,” Mara said on The Rich Eisen Show. “He hasn’t set foot on the field yet. But he’s got a lot of talent and we’re looking forward to seeing what we got when he gets here. As Bill Parcells used to say, let’s not get his bust ready for Canton just yet.”

Webb has yet to take any snaps with the Giants, but he’ll do so at rookie minicamp later this week. As for the regular season, Webb isn’t even guaranteed a spot on the game day roster each week.

He’ll have to beat out Josh Johnson and Geno Smith for the backup job, which is easier said than done. Smith is a proven No. 2 quarterback in the NFL and understands a pro-style offense better than Davis does. In the event that Manning gets hurt, the Giants would probably rather go to a player with multiple years of experience than a raw rookie.

That being said, Webb does have the brighter future. He just won’t be handed anything – especially the starting gig after Manning moves on.

“He’s a talented guy, but let’s let him get on the field and let’s let him play in the preseason and develop,” Mara said. “If he’s the successor, that’s great. If not, then we’ll find somebody else.”

Webb is the Giants’ highest-drafted quarterback since they took Philip Rivers in 2004, so there are certainly high expectations for the rookie in the coming years. He just has a long way to go before he makes an impact in New York.",fox-sports

9,Dustin Poirer: Eddie Alvarez 'made a mistake' signing to fight me at UFC 211 | FOX Sports,"Dustin Poirier wants to make one thing very clear ahead of his fight at UFC 211.

He has the utmost respect for former lightweight champion Eddie Alvarez and all the accolades he’s racked up over the years as one of the best fighters on the planet for more than a decade.

That being said, Poirier heard the rumors that Alvarez picked him as an opponent for the card taking place on Saturday night and he believes the Philadelphia native will regret that decision once they step into the Octagon together.

“He just made a mistake,” Poirier told FOX Sports about the fight with Alvarez. “He signed the papers and now it’s too late.”

Outside of the fact that he has to fight Alvarez at UFC 211, Poirier has nothing but good things to say about his opponent, especially when considering the laundry list of legends he’s faced during his career.

Alvarez has battled it out against the best lightweights in the world across several continents while consistently sitting near the top of the rankings if not holding onto a championship belt.

There’s no denying that Alvarez has put together a hall of fame worthy resume and Poirier will be the first person to agree with that statement but none of that matters when it comes to their fight.

Poirier knows that a lifetime on top also means a mountain of battle scars suffered over the years and he plans on opening up some of those old wounds on Saturday night.

“I respect him and I appreciate what he’s done in the sport and the miles he’s had to travel to do it. That being said, I’m a warrior and I’m going to go out there and damage this guy,” Poirier said.

“He wears damage bad and I’m going to damage him. That’s what this fight is to me. Go in there, be slick, be crafty, I’m evolving in the sport, I’m getting better every week. I feel like I’m hitting a stride. I’ve stumbled in the past but I’m one of the best fighters in the world and I absolutely know it in my heart.”

Alvarez hasn’t suffered defeat very often during his career and throughout his 33 professional fights, he’s only been finished by strikes on two different occasions.

Poirier won’t exactly be gunning for the knockout but he knows that if he lands his best punches, Alvarez won’t be standing by the time the final bell sounds.

“It won’t happen. It’s simple and plain. His body can’t take the damage,” Poirier said. “I’m bigger and stronger and my technique’s the best it’s ever been. If he goes out there and makes the wrong moves and allows me to connect, I’ll put him away. I’ll finish Eddie Alvarez.

“I respect that about Eddie. He comes in there looking for blood. He doesn’t break, he has a strong heart and a strong will and I’m excited about that kind of fighter. So let’s go, let’s fight.”

16,Sources: Comey sought resources for Russia probe,"Story highlights James Comey spoke to the leaders of the Senate intelligence committee last week

The Justice Department denied the allegation the former FBI director had requested more help

(CNN) FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department for more resources for the agency's investigation into Russian meddling of the US election and ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, just the week before the President fired him.

Comey told the heads of the Senate intelligence committee that he went to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week and pushed for more resources to be devoted to the Russia investigation, according to two sources familiar with the discussion.

Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Flores denies Comey asked Rosenstein for more resources. She called reporting to the contrary ""100% false,"" and told reporters she spoke directly with Rosenstein about the reports.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia met Monday with Comey and urged him to speed up the Russia investigation. Comey acknowledged in this discussion that things were moving slowly.

3,Trump says Comey 'wasn't doing a good job',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year

US President Donald Trump has said he fired FBI director James Comey because ""he was not doing a good job"".

He gave his first in-person explanation of the FBI chief's dismissal during a surprise meeting with Henry Kissinger.

The president has said he fired Mr Comey over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails.

But Mr Comey reportedly asked for more money for his inquiry into Russia's alleged meddling in the US election, according to US media.

Days before his removal, he made the request to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who recommended Mr Comey's dismissal to the president, according to leaks.

Mr Comey's dismissal has shocked Washington and outraged Democrats.

The sacking ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,"" said Adam Schiff, who is the highest ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

But the president stood by his actions on Wednesday morning, hours before a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - his first with any Russian official since taking power.

""James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI,"" he said in early morning tweets.

""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"" he added.

It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired.

What is the latest reaction on Wednesday?

Russian President Vladimir Putin weighed in from a hockey rink in Sochi, saying: ""We have nothing to do with that"".

""President Trump is acting in according with his competence and in accordance with his law and constitution,"" he told CBS.

Meanwhile, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will request a closed and ""if necessary, classified"" all-senators separate briefing from senior Justice Department officials.

He also called for a special prosecutor to oversee the FBI investigation into any potential Russian ties to Mr Trump's associates.

But Vice President Mike Pence told reporters Mr Trump demonstrated ""strong and decisive leadership"" in his decision and the move was ""based solely and exclusively on his commitment to the best interest of the American people"".

""The president made the right decision at the right time,"" he said.

Why was James Comey fired?

President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that ""you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau"".

Mr Sessions said the department of justice was ""committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law"", and ""a fresh start is needed"".

Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the investigation into Mrs Clinton's emails, given that Mr Trump often praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.

But on Tuesday, Mr Trump followed the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who wrote a letter saying he could not defend the director's handling of the investigation into Secretary Clinton.

He added Mr Comey had been wrong to ""usurp"" the previous attorney general in July 2016 when he announced the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution.

Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when, according to US media, he learned he had just been fired when he saw the news on television.

The 56-year-old - who was three-and-a-half years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank.

What about the Russia investigation?

Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.

The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are looking into the same allegations but no conclusions have yet been reached.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?"" Mr Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference.

""This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" he added.

Mr Trump responded on Twitter that Mr Schumer had recently expressed his lack of confidence in the FBI chief.

A cover-up? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump and senior justice department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support.

Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree.

How did Comey handle the email inquiry?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Comey explains why he went public reopening Clinton email probe

Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.

The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.

He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.

What was Clinton FBI probe about?

He told the Senate last week it had made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again. Mrs Clinton lays part of the blame for her shock election defeat last November on Mr Comey.

He told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails, ""some of which contain classified information"", to her husband.

But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had sent only two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing.

Watergate 2.0?

In June 1972, five men were arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) at the Watergate office and hotel complex in Washington. The break-in was traced to President Richard Nixon's supporters.

The firing of James Comey is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when Mr Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the break-in and the subsequent cover-up.

""Not since Watergate has a president dismissed the person leading an investigation bearing on him,"" the New York Times wrote late on Tuesday.

Mr Nixon later admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry. He later became the only US president to resign.",bbc-news

""You are hereby terminated.""

With those words, President Donald J Trump became only the second commander-in-chief to fire his FBI director.

He and officials from the Department of Justice were clear why they felt James Comey had to go - more on that later.

Democrats, however, have their doubts over the timing. And reports in the meantime do indicate there was more going on.

So what are the possible reasons for his departure?

1) The official reason - the Clinton emails

President Trump was given letters by his Attorney-General Jeff Sessions and Mr Sessions' deputy, Rod J Rosenstein, outlining what they saw as failures in Mr Comey's time in office.

Mr Rosenstein's letter says ""the FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice"".

His letter focuses on the fallout from an FBI investigation, now closed, into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to store sensitive information while secretary of state.

""I cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken,"" Mr Rosenstein goes on to say.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Comey explains why he went public reopening Clinton email probe

So did Mr Comey act correctly?

""The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution,"" Mr Rosenstein's letter says.

Mr Comey chose to announce there would be no investigation because, the letter says, ""he believed attorney General Loretta Lynch had a conflict"".

While this was not customary, Mr Comey explained why he took the responsibility ahead of Mrs Lynch. He said he did it because she had recently generated adverse headlines by having a meeting with ex-President Bill Clinton on an airport runway. They said it was a casual encounter but she was accused of a conflict of interest.

It is also unusual for the FBI to go public with an investigation, especially during an election campaign. Mr Comey did that not once but twice. But he justified it by saying if he had not come forward, he could have been guilty of concealment.

What was Clinton FBI probe about?

Mrs Clinton's supporters cried foul when it emerged that the Trump election team was also under investigation by the FBI, but Mr Comey never divulged that until a long time after the election.

One key question though - if this was indeed the real reason Mr Comey was fired, why did the White House wait until now? The Clinton investigation was closed in early November, and Mr Trump has been in office since 20 January.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Mr Trump's letter dismissing Mr Comey was released by the White House

2) Russia

Mr Comey's public profile had risen recently in relation to the FBI's ongoing investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 election (as well as possible links between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia).

In fact, Mr Comey confirmed that such an investigation existed only on 20 March, when he spoke before a congressional intelligence committee.

Nothing has come from this investigation yet; Mr Comey said the investigation was ""very complex"" and that he could not give a timetable for its completion.

But US intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Russian President Vladimir Putin did order the hack against the DNC. And the Russia scandal has already claimed one Trump official - former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who was fired for not giving a correct account of his meetings with a Russian official.

The White House has consistently denied having links with Russia. But after Mr Comey's dismissal, Politico reported that the president ""had grown enraged by the Russia investigation"" and was ""frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia"".

""He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn't disappear and demanded they speak out for him,"" Politico reported. ""He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said.""

Mr Comey had been due to appear before the senate intelligence committee to speak on Russia on Thursday - its chairman, Richard Burr, said he was ""troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination"".

Democrat former presidential contender Bernie Sanders also highlighted the fact the decision came a day after former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates told a Senate committee of the concerns she had over Mr Flynn's Russia ties. He called the timing ""deeply troubling"".

3) He simply didn't like Comey

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year

""He's become more famous than me!"" Mr Trump said when beckoning Mr Comey at a January meeting, sending an air-kiss his way.

But could this have been a problem, rather than a compliment?

Citing unnamed White House officials on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported the two were a poor match, and that Mr Trump did not like the increased media attention on Mr Comey.

""He viewed Mr Comey as eager to step in front of TV cameras and questioned whether his expanding media profile was warping his view of the Russia investigation, the officials said.

The fact Mr Comey had not publicly talked down links between the Trump campaign and Russia was also a source of tension, the Journal reported.

WASHINGTON — President Trump’s abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey triggered renewed calls this week from Democratic senators for the appointment of a special counsel or independent prosecutor to investigate ties between President Trump’s associates and Russia.

“If there was ever a time when circumstances warranted a special prosecutor, it is right now,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, a day after Comey’s dismissal.

But the power to appoint a special prosecutor rests with a key figure in the Trump administration who played a role in Comey’s firing.

While Attorney General Jeff Sessions has legal authority to make the appointment, he has recused himself from investigations relating to the 2016 campaign after his undisclosed conversations with Russia’s ambassador Sergey Kislyak came to light. As a result, the responsibility falls squarely on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who wrote Tuesday’s memo justifying Comey’s removal.

During his confirmation hearings for the No. 2 post at the Department of Justice, Rosenstein refused to commit to Democrats’ calls for a special prosecutor to oversee the inquiry.

Read more:

Syracuse University law professor William Banks said it’s unrealistic to expect action from Rosenstein. “Even if the deputy wanted to do this, he would be shot down by the White House, I imagine,” Banks said.

The options are limited for congressional Democrats.

A post-Watergate independent counsel law that gave Congress the authority to call on the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor lapsed in 1999. Passing a new version, much less with the margin needed to overturn a certain presidential veto, is unlikely in a GOP-controlled Congress, Banks said.

On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., rejected the calls for an independent prosecutor. A new probe, he said, would “impede” an investigation already under way by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

6,White House: Trump thought about firing Comey since Election Day,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump had been t hinking about firing FBI Director James Comey since Election Day , White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday.

""The President has lost confidence in Director Comey and, frankly, he'd been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected,"" Sanders told reporters, adding that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had raised concerns about the former FBI chief on Monday, prompting Trump to ask him to put his recommendation in writing.

Revelations that Trump had been unconvinced by Comey for his entire transition and presidency were surprising given the White House had previously expressed confidence in the ousted FBI chief multiple times. Sanders also said Trump was not the only one to lose confidence in the FBI director, adding there were deep reservations about him inside the FBI.

Sanders also said that Trump didn't regret not firing Comey sooner, saying he ""wanted to give Director Comey a chance.""

She also pointed to a ""big catalyst"" from last week congressional testimony by the former FBI chief when he related how he held a news conference without notifying his superiors last year. In the blockbuster appearance, Comey announced that Hillary Clinton would not face charges over her email server but also heavily criticized her handling of classified material.

""Director Comey made a pretty startling revelation that he had essentially taken a stick of dynamite and thrown it into the Department of Justice by going around the chain of command,"" Sanders said.

""That is simply not allowed,"" she said.

Meanwhile, Comey asked the Justice Department for more resources for the agency's investigation into Russian meddling of the US election and ties to Trump's presidential campaign, just the week before the President fired him.

Comey told the heads of the Senate intelligence committee that he went to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week and pushed for more resources to be devoted to the Russia investigation, according to two sources familiar with the discussion.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia met Monday with Comey and urged him to speed up the Russia investigation. Comey acknowledged in this discussion that things were moving slowly.

Warner told CNN Wednesday he has asked Comey to testify before the committee Tuesday. It is an invitation only at this point -- no word yet if he will appear.

Before Rosenstein, Comey had been working with the acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente. Comey's requests for funds was first reported by The New York Times

In the wake of Comey's firing, a fierce political battle has erupted, as Democrats step up demands for a special prosecutor but Republican leaders hold the line to shield the White House.

With Washington still in disbelief over Tuesday's dramatic events that sent shockwaves across the nation, Trump blasted criticism of his sudden move, declaring that the former FBI chief ""wasn't doing a good job.""

But the President's comments did little to dispel the controversy over the firing of Comey: the FBI director overseeing the bureau's probe into whether there were any links between Trump campaign aides and Russia at a time when Moscow is accused of meddling in last year's election.

Critics claimed that Trump was trying to shut down the FBI Russia investigation. They ridiculed the White House's rationale for the firing -- that it was over Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation that many Democrats believe cost the former secretary of state the presidency.

Trump's defense

The substantive push back was left to Vice President Mike Pence, who praised his boss for showing strong leadership to restore public confidence in the FBI and refuted suggestions the administration had anything to hide over Russia.

""President Trump made the right decision at the right time to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general, to ask for the termination, to support the termination of the director of the FBI,"" Pence told reporters on Capitol Hill.

The vice president also reiterated the White House's line that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that there is no evidence to support the idea of collusion between Trump aides and Russia.

But he would not answer a question about whether the impetus for the report by Rosenstein that led to Comey's dismissal came from the White House or the Justice Department.

Pence's appearance before the cameras was a strategic decision of the White House to push back on the political crisis that ensued after Trump's move. The next White House official to face the public will be deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who will brief reporters at 1:30 p.m. ET.

Trump joined the counter attack on Twitter as he lambasted his critics and Democrats who are accusing him of an abuse of power.

""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"" Trump wrote, and said a new FBI director would do a far better job.

Congress' next steps

In a highly unusual move, large numbers of Democrats showed up for the opening of Senate business on Wednesday, as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a closed briefing of all senators with Comey and renewed his calls for a special prosecutor.

""Nothing less is at stake than the American people's faith in our criminal justice system and the integrity of the executive branch of our government,"" Schumer said.

But Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sought to quell the rising pressure on the White House.

McConnell argued that Democrats were ""complaining"" about Comey's removal after having argued during the campaign that Comey had behaved unfairly toward Clinton.

""Partisan calls,"" he said, shouldn't slow down the investigation by the Senate intelligence committee.

However, some other Republican senators are expressing increasing concerns about the escalating political crisis and the firing of Comey.

Arizona Sen. John McCain renewed his calls for a special congressional committee to investigate allegations of Russian election meddling.

""When you fire probably, arguably, the most respected person in America you better have a very good explanation and so far I haven't seen that,"" McCain told CNN's Manu Raju.

McCain said the White House rationale that Comey was fired because of his handling over the investigation into Clinton's emails was not sufficient.

The surreal

Trump's demeanor suggested defiance on Wednesday but also verged on the surreal.

With questions swirling about his links with Russia, he met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the Oval Office for talks he later said were dominated by Syria.

The Russian embassy, meanwhile, tweeted a picture of Trump shaking hands with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who is at the center of the Russia storm since his conversations with Michael Flynn led to the firing of the former national security adviser.

Then Trump sat down with Henry Kissinger, who served as secretary of state under President Richard Nixon, apparently unconcerned that the photo-op could fuel already circulating allusions to the Watergate scandal in the 1970s.

Developments and revelations about the Comey firing tumbled out at a frenetic pace on Wednesday.

Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone was among those who recommended to the President that he fire Comey, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Stone, who also is being scrutinized by the FBI as part of its Russia investigation, spoke to Trump after Comey appeared at a hearing last week on Capitol Hill, according to the source.

The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

Trump immediately disputed that Stone was involved: ""The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision.""

Stone said he was not the source behind the reporting but added that he supported the firing of Comey ""100%.""

I am not the source of Politico/ CNN stories claiming I urged @realDonaldTrump 2 fire Comey. Never made such claim. I support decision 100% — Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) May 10, 2017

A White House spokesperson reached out to CNN to reiterate the President's tweet that he has not spoken to Stone in a ""long time.""

""The President has not spoken to Roger Stone in many months and any reports suggesting otherwise are categorically untrue,"" the spokesperson said.

Career ended

Comey's dismissal ends a major chapter in a career of the man once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.

In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

White House press secretary Sean Spicer, sandwiched in the dark Tuesday night between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from Rosenstein , which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings.

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

Trump's decision came on a day when CNN reported that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former national security adviser Michael Flynn seeking business records, as part of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year's election, according to people familiar with the matter.

The top senators on the Senate intelligence committee, Republican Richard Burr and Democrat Mark Warner, met Comey on Monday and urged him to speed up the Russia investigation, CNN's Sara Murray reported.

The search for Comey's successor is meanwhile already underway.

6,And then Henry Kissinger walks in...: 24 hours in the Donald Trump circus,"(CNN) Donald Trump promised a White House like no other when he pulled the biggest upset in presidential history to become the 44th man to hold the job. Man has he delivered.

From his Twitter feed to his dinner guests (Ted Nugent, Kid Rock and Sarah Palin -- all in one night!), the Trump White House has looked, and run, like nothing we've ever seen before.

But, even by Trump's standards, the last 24 hours has been surreal. In fact, the last day feels more like a reality TV show -- storyline twists and turns, surprise guest appearances -- than it does anything resembling a semi-normal day in political Washington.

Let's start with the present moment and then rewind.

The White House press pool was called into the Oval Office just before noon eastern time for what they expected to be a photo op between Trump and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov since the two men were scheduled to huddle earlier today.

But it wasn't Lavrov they found sitting with the president! It was Henry Kissinger, best known for his role as Secretary of State to President Richard Nixon!

Reporters asked Trump about the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Trump responded, briefly, that Comey was simply ""not doing a good job."" It was apparently lost on Trump that the last 16 hours had been dominated by comparisons between Nixon's ""Saturday Night Massacre"" -- where he jettisoned the independent counsel investigating Watergate -- and Trump's decision to part ways with Comey. Either that or Trump was pulling the greatest troll move ever by having Kissinger there when he took his first questions from reporters about the Comey firing. (I'm not ready to rule that option out.)

Speaking of Lavrov, he didn't make the Kissinger photo op but that doesn't mean we didn't see him. Shortly after the meeting with Trump, the Russian news agency TASS put out a series of pictures of the gathering. But, wait! There was a special guest with them. This guy:

In the event you have been under a pile of coats for the last 2 years or so, the guy next to Trump is Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Yes, the same Sergey Kislyak at the center of the FBI investigation into deposed national security adviser Michael Flynn. (Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his conversations with Kislyak.) And, yes, the same Sergey Kislyak who Attorney General Jeff Sessions forgot he had met with -- twice -- during the 2016 presidential campaign, a memory lapse that led him to recuse himself from the ongoing Russia investigation.

Whoops! I forgot to mention that in the midst of all of this, Vladimir Putin gave an interview about the Comey firing -- in full hockey gear

Putin says Comey's firing will have 'no effect' on US-Russia relations in bizarre interview in full hockey gearhttps://t.co/g4X3uFV8m6 pic.twitter.com/SKHDSaTBRQ — Brett LoGiurato (@BrettLoGiurato) May 10, 2017

Before meeting with Kislyak and Lavrov -- and Kissinger -- Trump was watching cable TV. And lots of it. He tapped out a series of tweets regarding Comey and the way the firing was being covered beginning with this one right at 7:10 a.m. ET: ""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!""

(Trump has previously insisted he doesn't watch CNN because it is ""fake news."" He apparently has reconsidered that decision. Welcome back, Mr. President!)

Then, finally, go back to 6 p.m. ET last night when Trump shocked the world -- and, apparently, much of his administration and Congress -- when he jettisoned Comey with a letter hand-delivered to the FBI by his former bodyguard. (That sentence, in and of itself, is surreal.) The letter, which was four short paragraphs, included this amazing line: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.""

If Aaron Sorkin had written a ""West Wing"" episode with this many twists and turns, misdirections and shocking surprises, everyone in the writer's room would have rolled their eyes. Except this isn't a drama; it's real life. Or maybe reality life.

6,How the GOP reacted to Trump's Comey firing,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's sudden decision Tuesday to fire FBI Director James Comey has forced GOP lawmakers to decide whether to side with the White House on a move that comes in the middle of the FBI's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Here's how Republican lawmakers have reacted:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: ""Our Democratic colleagues (are) complaining about the removal of an FBI director whom they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized. ... Partisan calls should not delay the considerable work of Chairman (Richard) Burr and Vice Chairman (Mark) Warner. Too much is at stake.""

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina, in a statement: ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the committee. In my interactions with the director and with the bureau under his leadership, he and the FBI have always been straightforward with our Committee. Director Comey has been more forthcoming with information than any FBI director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intelligence committees. His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.""

Sen. John McCain of Arizona to reporters: ""There will be more shoes to drop. There always are on these scandals.""

Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska in a statement: ""Regardless of how you think Director Comey handled the unprecedented complexities of the 2016 election cycle, the timing of this firing is very troubling. Jim Comey is an honorable public servant, and in the midst of a crisis of public trust that goes well beyond who you voted for in the presidential election, the loss of an honorable public servant is a loss for the nation. As the chairman of the Judiciary committee's oversight subcommittee, I have reached out to the deputy attorney general for clarity on his rationale for recommending this action.""

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida to reporters: ""I would expect the FBI to continue to function along the lines that we have come to expect it to function.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on CNN's ""New Day"": ""I think Director Comey is a fine man, but Democrats called for his removal about two to three, four weeks ago and now he's gone and we get a chance to pick on a new director that hopefully we can all agree is above reproach.""

Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona to reporters: ""I just don't know why this happened now. I'm having trouble with it still. With regard to a special prosecutor, I'm looking to see how that would impact the Senate investigation that's going on. I have confidence in the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation, so still reviewing.""

Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio in a statement: ""Given the timing and circumstances of the decision, I believe the White House should provide a fuller explanation regarding the President's rationale. The American people must have faith in a strong, independent FBI. I'm concerned about eroding trust in this premier law enforcement agency.""

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky on Fox News: ""All they continue to ask for is more power to invade our phone calls and more power to invade our privacy. I was not a huge Comey fan.""

Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in a statement: ""Whether or not you are a supporter of Mr. James Comey's actions as FBI director, the timing of his firing -- in the middle of an investigation into Russia's interference in our election -- is serious cause for concern.""

Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee in a statement: ""It would have been easier to explain if the President had fired the FBI director earlier when Senator Schumer and other Democrats said they'd lost confidence in Mr. Comey.""

Sen. John Thune of South Dakota on CNN: ""The timing of all of this is something the administration will have to answer questions about.""

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in a statement: ""Today's announcement is likely the inevitable conclusion of Director Comey's decision last July to bypass the longstanding protocols of the Justice Department and publicly announce the reasons he had decided not to recommend an indictment of Hillary Clinton and to offer his personal views of Mrs. Clinton's actions.

""That decision, while well-intentioned, embroiled Director Comey into political controversies that unfortunately continued to this day.

""Any suggestion that today's announcement is somehow an effort to stop the FBI's investigation of Russia's attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced. The President did not fire the entire FBI; he fired the director. I have every confidence that the FBI will continue to pursue its investigation. In addition, I am certain that the Senate Intelligence Committee, on which I serve, will continue its own bipartisan investigation and will follow the evidence wherever it leads.""

House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia: ""The FBI is the premier law enforcement agency in the world and it is critical to have a director who holds the trust of the American people. It is clearly the President's prerogative to remove the FBI director, as was recommended by the top two officials at the Department of Justice.""

Rep. Rod Blum of Iowa, at a town hall meeting: ""I think it's probably time for Comey to go. The FBI has been way too involved in politics -- both sides of the aisle. Been too politicized. And the president has every authority under the constitution to terminate the director of the FBI. So, I'm supportive of that decision.""

Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan in a tweet: ""My staff and I are reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia. The second paragraph of this letter is bizarre."" : ""My staff and I are reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia. The second paragraph of this letter is bizarre.""

Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia: ""Both Democrats and Republicans attacked the FBI Director at various times for various reasons and called for his ouster. However, I can't defend or explain tonight's actions or timing of the firing of FBI Director James Comey. The FBI investigation into the Russian impact on the 2016 election must continue. There must be an independent investigation that the American people can trust.""

Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida in a statement: ""Today's extraordinary decision raises many questions all of which must be answered. Congress and the American people need a transparent explanation as to how this decision was reached and why it was executed at this time. It is critical that the FBI can continue all of its pending work with independence and integrity -- especially the investigation into the Russian government's efforts to influence our last election and undermine American democracy. Today I reiterate the need for Congress to establish a select committee with full investigatory powers to thoroughly examine this matter.""",cnn
3,Trump 'considered firing Comey since taking office',"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters gather outside the White House over James Comey's dismissal

President Donald Trump had been considering firing former FBI Director James Comey since he was elected, a White House spokeswoman has said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that there was an ""erosion of confidence"" in Mr Comey over the last year after several missteps.

The administration says Mr Comey was removed on Tuesday for his handling of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry.

But Democrats say it is because he was probing alleged Russia-Trump links.

During a news conference on Wednesday, Ms Huckabee Sanders also accused the former FBI chief of ""throwing a stick of dynamite"" into the Department of Justice.

The White House spokeswoman raised eyebrows among the press corps by saying that Mr Comey had committed ""atrocities, circumventing the chain of command"".

Ms Huckabee Sanders also rejected calls to appoint a special prosecutor to the FBI investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election.

""We don't think it's necessary,"" she said. ""No one wants this to be finished and completed more than us.""

Her comments came as the US Senate Intelligence Committee invited Mr Comey to testify before the panel on Tuesday.

Top Democrat Senator Mark Warner said the panel had so far ""not heard back"".

Washington is still shaking from the aftershocks of Mr Comey's unexpected dismissal.

The move ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,"" said Adam Schiff, the highest-ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

But the president stood by his actions on Wednesday during a surprise meeting with Henry Kissinger, saying Mr Comey was fired ""because he was not doing a good job"".

His first in-person explanation for his actions came before a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak - his first with any Russian official since taking power.

It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired.

'Not good optics' - Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

If Donald Trump is trying to avoid comparisons with Richard Nixon's scandal-plagued presidency, welcoming Henry Kissinger - the man probably most closely connected with the former president - in the Oval Office probably isn't the best move.

The whole group meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak was a bit strange, starting with the fact that it happened at all. Given the allegations that Mr Trump fired James Comey because of the FBI investigation into Russia ties to the Trump campaign, meeting with a Russian ambassador the very next day isn't exactly good optics, as they say.

Neither is keeping US media out of the room and having Russian state photographers provide the only public images of the event - images that are sure to be featured in Democratic campaign adverts in the not-too-distant future.

During the campaign, Mr Trump famously joked that he could shoot somebody, and his supporters would stick by him. Smiling with the Russian ambassador in the midst of a growing Russian hacking controversy is the diplomatic equivalent - a brazen move sans firearms.

Many in Washington will howl, but there's no guarantee it will move the needle among the president's legions.",bbc-news

Russian and the US are looking to ""remove all the barriers"" to having a better relationship, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said.

He said he thought Moscow's relations with the current administration would be better than with the previous one.

Mr Lavrov was speaking after talks in Washington with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

The meetings came a day after the US president fired FBI director James Comey.

Mr Comey was leading an investigation into alleged Russian interference in last year's US election.

Clearly impatient with journalists' repeated questions about Mr Comey, Mr Lavrov rejected claims that Moscow had intervened in the presidential election as ""fabrications"".

A key topic of conversation at the meetings was the war in Syria, in particular a Russian plan to create ""safe zones"". Mr Lavrov praised the talks with Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson as ""constructive"".

The US administration has broadly welcomed the Russian plan, but has expressed wariness about Moscow's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and the role of Iran - and Iranian proxy forces - in the country.

US officials say they need to hear more about who would patrol the proposed zones, and how they would be enforced.

Oval Office honour

Mr Lavrov told journalists: ""I would say that our dialogue as of now is free from ideology that was very typical for [Barack] Obama's administration.

""Both Mr Trump and the secretary of state of his administration, as I realised today once again, are businesslike people and they want to reach agreements.

""The goal of both President Trump and [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin is to have concrete results which will be tangible and which will allow us to alleviate problems, including on the international agenda.""

10,iPhone 8 leaked images show an all glass design,"This might be our best look yet at the iPhone 8 – or at least renders of it, based on leaked CAD blueprints.

The images show the phone from all angles, and highlight a metal frame and a shiny glass back, making for a marked departure from the metal-backed iPhone 7.

There’s also a vertically aligned dual-lens camera, in place of the horizontally aligned one on the iPhone 7 Plus. This has been rumored before and it’s thought that the change could somehow be needed to help with rumored augmented reality functions of the phone.

Image 1 of 3 Image 2 of 3 Image 3 of 3

Big screen, small body

The port and button placement largely seems similar to what’s gone before though, with two speaker grilles and a Lightning port on the bottom edge, a power button on the right edge and volume buttons on the left.

Apparently the iPhone 8 pictured here has dimensions of 143.5 x 70.9 x 7.7mm, which would make it slightly bigger in all dimensions than the 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm iPhone 7, but smaller (though still slightly thicker) than the iPhone 7 Plus.

Despite that it will probably have a bigger screen than either, with many current rumors pointing to a 5.8-inch display, achieved by removing the home button and having an all-screen front, as you can also see in these images.

The source of this leak theorizes that the fingerprint scanner could instead be built either into the display itself, as has been rumored a number of times, or into the Apple logo on the back.

These images largely line up with a dummy unit we saw previously. That too was supposedly based on leaked designs, so the source diagrams could be the same.

These latest images were sourced for MySmartPrice by @OnLeaks, who is one of the more reputable leakers in the business, but they themselves aren’t certain that this will be the iPhone 8’s final form, as Apple has apparently been working on a number of prototypes, so this could end up being an unused design.

We might not know for sure until September, when the iPhone 8 is expected to be officially announced.",techradar
10,Windows 10 HomeHub looks to turn all-in-one PCs into the best smart speakers,"Microsoft apparently will confront the rise of smart speakers with a new kind of all-in-one PC, judging from leaked images and details of a Windows 10 HomeHub experience provided to The Verge.

HomeHub, which first leaked late last year, is essentially an enhanced version of the Windows 10 lock screen that allows for deeper voice controls through Cortana and more pertinent information than any Windows lock screen has provided.

Of course, the idea is for this new HomeHub overlay to be released in tandem with slightly specialized all-in-one computers through its device manufacturing partners, computers deliberately designed to be placed in kitchens and living rooms.

Citing internal sources, The Verge reports that HomeHub will act as an always-on experience for touchscreen all-in-one PCs, with a digital drawing board being one of its primary features. The suspicion is that Microsoft is working with partners on devices comparable to that of the newly-minted Amazon Echo Show.

However, those sources also allegedly say that any device running Windows 10 HomeHub must be a full PC, as that’s to be one of Microsoft’s key advantages over existing and future smart speakers.

Finally, a place for the PC again

Microsoft’s goal here seems to provide a compelling reason to bring all-in-one PCs that were so popular decades ago back into consumers’ houses where laptops, tablets and phones have ruled for years. Further to that point will be features like calendar management, sticky notes and to-do lists as well as voice calls (likely through Skype).

To really cement in whole “HomeHub” idea, the feature is expected to support Hue, Nest, Insteon, Wink and SmartThings devices, with Cortana able to issue commands to said devices.

According to The Verge’s sources, Microsoft plans for these features to arrive in Windows 10 with the forthcoming autumn update due in September. As a follow-up, Microsoft reportedly expects HP and Lenovo to have such devices ready for the holiday rush.

As for when we’ll officially see Windows 10 HomeHub and the various devices in which it will live, either Microsoft Build 2017 or its May 23 Surface event are fine guesses.

10,Would you let a robot perform your eye surgery? One just passed clinical trials,"The idea of having your eyes operated on is a pretty terrifying proposal at the best of times, but throw robot surgeons into the mix and it suddenly feels very James Bond. But robot optical surgery is now a very real possibility thanks to the University of Oxford in the UK.

For the first time a robot has passed clinical trials to perform highly delicate retinal surgery, meaning it could soon become a fixture in hospital wards. The robot, named R2D2 (yes, really) outperformed its human counterparts in the control group.

The reason that a robot is proving so effective in this field is the microscopic level of movement needed to perform the surgery, well outside the capabilities of even the most competent surgeon.

Talking to the BBC about the Robotic Retinal Dissection Device (R2D2), the program’s director Dr Robert MacLaren said: “Current technology with laser scanners and microscopes allows us to monitor retinal diseases at the microscopic level, but the things we see are beyond the physiological limit of what the human hand can operate on.

""With a robotic system, we open up a whole new chapter of eye operations that currently cannot be performed.”

Slow and steady

In order to operate on a retina, an incision 10 microns deep at the back of the eye is necessary. For reference, a human hair averages at about 60 microns. As precise as human surgeons are, even the pulse of their heart is enough to move their hand more than 10 microns.

The clinical trial took the form of 12 retina membrane removal operations, 6 by human surgeons, 6 by R2D2. In the group operated on by the human surgeons, there were five micro-hemorrhages (minor bleeds) and two retinal touches, which we feel a bit queasy just writing. In comparison, R2D2 only had two micro-hemorrhages and one retinal touch.

If it helps set your mind at ease, the robot is still controlled by a human surgeon so it isn’t deciding where and when to cut, yet.

10,Windows 10 S will be locked to Edge browser – Chrome won’t be an option,"Never mind Microsoft Edge being locked as the default browser in Windows 10 S, as we heard last week – it's now emerged that Edge's biggest rival, and the most popular desktop web browser in the world, Chrome, won’t even be available to install on the lightweight version of Microsoft’s desktop OS.

As we discussed last week, the central point of Windows 10 S is to restrict the operating system to apps from the Windows Store so Microsoft can better police security – but as spotted by ZDNet, the store’s policies will actually forbid Chrome (or other third-party browsers, such as Firefox) from gaining entry.

Several sections in the list of Windows Store policies call for apps to “not jeopardize or compromise user security” (unsurprisingly), but more to the point, specify that: “Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate HTML and JavaScript engines provided by the Windows Platform.”

So if Google did want to turn Chrome into a universal app for use with Windows 10 S, the browser wouldn’t be able to use its own engines. In other words, it wouldn’t be Chrome anymore, but just a shell of Google’s browser using Microsoft’s HTML and JavaScript engines.

ZDNet also cited a developer who had sent their Chromium-based desktop browser to be approved by Microsoft, and had it refused, being told that browsers represent a particular security risk, and that: “They are secure only if, like Edge, they're true UWP apps, so they run in a sandbox environment and they don't have access to the overall system.”

The upshot of all this is that while these store policies remain in place, Chrome – and indeed other third-party browsers – won’t be coming to Windows 10 S. Or at least, if they do, the apps in question will only be superficial lookalikes.

The best laptops for college all run full Windows 10 and macOS

Fair turnabout?

As we touched on last week, you could argue this is fair turnabout: Google did, after all, build Chrome OS around its own browser, and it’s also a locked-down ecosystem (although these days, if you have one of the Chromebooks that support Android apps it’s theoretically possible to use a third-party browser, although there’s no guarantee it'll function smoothly).

And Microsoft is certainly arguing that this is an important move in terms of the security of Windows 10 S, which is also a fair point. But it’s clearly also a major advantage for the company to keep its browser rivals away from its desktop OS.

Microsoft further notes that folks can simply shift over to the full-fat version of Windows if they want more choice. The company stated: “If people would like to access apps from other stores and services, they can switch to Windows 10 Pro at any time.”

It’s also worth bearing in mind that as well as Edge being locked as the default browser on Windows 10 S, Bing is locked as the default search engine, so you can’t switch to Google for your searches either.",techradar
6,"Donald Trump, Richard Nixon and Watergate: What's the same and what's different?","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, is drawing comparisons to a controversial figure from 44 years past, President Nixon. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains. Buzz60

The comparisons between President Richard Nixon, the Watergate scandal that helped end his presidency and President Trump are coming with an increasing frequency these days, particularly after Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey Monday.

Watergate refers to the all-encompassing series of scandals that engulfed Nixon starting with the June 17, 1972, failed break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington's Watergate office complex. Five men, including four Cuban exiles affiliated with the CIA and James McCord, the security director of Nixon's 1972 re-election committee, were caught inside the DNC offices with bugging equipment and photographs.

By the time Nixon resigned and left office on Aug. 9, 1974, the scandal had become a catalog of many of Nixon's abuses of power. They included FBI wiretaps of 17 government officials and journalists, a 1970 plan to relax internal security procedures to track suspected subversives, the existence of a secret White House special investigations unit called the Plumbers, the secret bombing of Cambodia and a wide-ranging dirty tricks program run by the Nixon 1972 campaign team against potential Democratic opponents.

The final straw was the release of June 23, 1972, tape of a conversation between Nixon and his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, in which Nixon approved a plan to use the CIA to block the FBI's investigation of the Watergate break-in.

The Trump campaign and some of his associates are being investigated by the FBI and two congressional committees for possible involvement in the Russian-led hacking of the Democratic National Committee's email system and the transfer of those emails to the online site WikiLeaks, which posts secret government and political documents online.Nothing so far that links Trump personally to the hacking or leaks.

So, what are the similarities and similarities between the Trump White House and Nixon's?

Similarities

• Firing investigators. By May 1973, a special prosecutor was appointed by Attorney General Elliot Richardson to investigate potential crimes stemming from the Watergate break-in and subsequent White House cover-up of its involvement. Richardson, a former secretary of Defense and Health, Education and Welfare, appointed his former mentor from Harvard Law School, Archibald Cox. A former solicitor general for President John Kennedy, a Nixon nemesis, Cox quickly angered the Nixon White House with its demands for documents and tapes of Nixon's conversations in the White House, the existence of which was revealed in July.

On Oct. 20, 1973, Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Cox. Richardson refused and resigned. Nixon then asked Richardson's deputy, William Ruckelshaus, to fire Cox, He, too, refused and resigned. Solicitor General Robert Bork, the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, agreed to fire Cox, reasoning that Nixon would just roll through the entire department until he found someone willing to get rid of Cox. Those firings, called the Saturday Night Massacre, increased calls for Nixon's impeachment.

On Monday, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, saying that he had lost confidence in Comey's ability to run the FBI because of how he handled last year's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server on which some classified government documents were sent. Comey's firing spurred immediate comparisons to the Cox firing, because the FBI is also investigating connections between Trump's campaign and administration with Russia and its interference in the 2016 elections.

• Embattled White House spokesmen. Nixon's press secretary, Ronald Ziegler, became notorious for his briefings in which he tried to explain the constantly changing explanations from the White House about the involvement of administration officials in the Watergate break-in and cover-up. During one briefing, Ziegler said his previous, inaccurate statements were ""inoperative.""

Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, has struggled to deal with the president's numerous tweets and inaccurate statements. On Tuesday, he reportedly told television camera operators to turn off their lights as he and other members of the White House press team tried to explain the Comey firing.

• Campaign dirty tricks. Nixon's campaign hired young political operatives to disrupt the operations of several Democratic candidates for president in 1972. They included, as the Washington Post wrote on Oct. 10, 1972, ""Following members of Democratic candidates' families and assembling dossiers on their personal lives; forging letters and distributing them under the candidates' letterheads; leaking false and manufactured items to the press; throwing campaign schedules into disarray; seizing confidential campaign files; and investigating the lives of dozens of Democratic campaign workers.""

The Trump campaign benefited from a Russian plan to destabilize the U.S. elections last year, which included the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails by a hacker called Guccifer 2.0. Those emails were then given to the online leak site WikiLeaks and distributed online over a period of weeks during the height of the general election campaign. Roger Stone, an alumnus of the 1972 Nixon campaign and a longtime Trump adviser, spoke often during the campaign of impending WikiLeaks email dumps and their effect on the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

In each case, it was never proved the Nixon knew in advance about his campaign's dirty tricks or that Trump had any knowledge of the connections of people affiliated with his campaign with the Russian government or its agents.

Differences

• There is no special prosecutor. Yet. Nixon was forced to agree to the appointment of Cox and his successor, high-powered Houston lawyer Leon Jaworski to lead a special prosecution team of Watergate-related crimes because of charges that the Justice Department was too politically compromise to investigate the president who had appointed its top officers.

Claims of political bias exist now, but so far neither Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions or key Republicans, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have endorsed calling for a special prosecutor into the Russia hacking case. Sessions has recused himself from any role in the Russia investigation, citing his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which Sessions failed to acknowledge during his Senate confirmation hearings. Any special prosecutor in that case would have to be appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but he and Sessions both were involved in the firing of FBI director Comey.

• Congressional control. In 1973, Congress was controlled by Democrats, who had long distrusted Republican Nixon for a series of political maneuvers over the course of his political career, which started in 1946. Senate Democrats called for the creation of a special committee, the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, to investigate the claims of dirty tricks and the White House connection to the Watergate break-in. After the Saturday Night Massacre, calls for impeachment proceedings for Nixon picked up steam. By the summer of 1974, the House Judiciary Committee was considering multiple articles of impeachment against Nixon.

This year, however, the White House and Congress are controlled by Republicans, and congressional leadership has been quiet in calling for a special prosecutor or a deeper investigation into the Trump administration. However, the GOP-controlled Senate and House intelligence committees are investigating the Trump campaign and the Russian hacking. The Senate investigation, led by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., has been noted for its cooperation with Senate Democrats, particularly Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, while the House probe has been stalled by political squabbling and the recusal of the panel's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, for his meetings with Trump officials.

6,Comey fired before Justice Department could complete internal probe into his election actions,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

WASHINGTON— President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey before the Justice Department's inspector general could complete a wide-ranging review of his handling of Hillary Clinton's email investigation.

Two weeks before Trump's inauguration, Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz took the extraordinary step of publicly announcing a review into the FBI's inquiry into Clinton’s use of a private server while secretary of State.

Trump, along with Justice Department leadership, said Tuesday they fired Comey for his controversial handling the Clinton case.

But the fact that Comey was fired as the official review of his actions was still ongoing is raising serious questions among congressional leaders and legal analysts about the speed with which Attorney General Jeff Sessions and newly-confirmed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommended Comey’s dismissal.

Democrat and some Republican lawmakers directly challenged the timing of of the director's abrupt firing, suggesting that it could be an attempt to redirect attention away from the FBI and congressional investigations analyzing possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

""The timing and reasoning incites people to believe that something is being covered up,'' said North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is reviewing Russian interference in the 2016 elections along with the House Intelligence Committee.

An ""incredulous'' California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on Trump and the Justice Department to explain why there was little reference to the looming Russia investigation in Comey's dismissal.

""If the reason for firing Comey was his handling of the Clinton investigation, why now?'' Feinstein asked.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, specifically referenced the inspector general's investigation, saying that review could have brought an independent assessment of Comey's fate.

""Why didn't the president wait for the conclusion of the inspector general's investigation?'' Schumer said Wednesday. ""There is little reason to believe that Mr. Rosenstein's letter is the true reason Mr. Comey was dismissed.''

In a three-page memo to Sessions outlining the case for Comey's removal, released by the White House, Rosenstein offered a scathing account of the director's management of the Clinton investigation. Rosenstein specifically took issue with Comey's unusual July news conference that the FBI was recommending Clinton not be prosecuted, and later public announcement just 11 days before the November election that he was re-opening the inquiry.

""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken,'' Rosenstein wrote. ""As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understand the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.''

The written assessment, assembled during Rosenstein's first 10 days on the job, did not, however, mention the ongoing inspector general's inquiry that had been underway for nearly five months – and was being directed from a suite offices on the same floor as the new deputy attorney general.

That's not because it was secret. In fact, the Justice Department's investigation was strikingly public.

The launch of such internal Justice inquiries are rarely accompanied by a press release, but Horowitz, the inspector general, felt it necessary because of the cascade of requests for an investigation that poured in from lawmakers and even members of the public.

As attention turned to the bumpy transition to the Trump administration, little more was said about the internal probe that promised an exhumation of events that Clinton has claimed helped doom her bid for the White House – until last week. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where then-FBI Director James Comey offered an animated defense of the Clinton case.

He also turned more than few heads when he randomly acknowledged that the inspector general interview, but indicated that there may be a need for follow-up questioning.

""Lordy, has this been painful,'' Comey said of the firestorm prompted by his actions in the Clinton case. ""I've gotten all kinds of rocks thrown at me, and this has been really hard. But I think I've down the right thing.''

Horowitz has declined to comment on the course of the review and the timing of its projected conclusion, but a team of investigators has been gathering documents and seeking witness interviews.

Among those also likely to be questioned include former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by Trump while serving as acting attorney general during the initial days of the Trump administration. Yates' Jan. 30 dismissal followed her refusal to direct Justice attorneys to defend the president's controversial travel ban.

Ron Hosko, a former assistant FBI director who is familiar the inspector general process, said the Trump administration would have been better served had it waited for the completion of Horowitz's probe.

""I can clearly see the reasoning for Rosenstein's stated conclusions,'' Hosko said. ""The director went too far. He usurped the role of a prosecutor by recommending that charges not be filed against the secretary. That's all true. And it was true five months ago.

""The timing of this decision is indeed questionable,'' Hosko said. ""They (Trump administration officials) had the opportunity to hang their decision on the back of the IG investigation. Why they didn't only raises questions about their motives.""

What's more, Hosko said ""the way they did it"" – allowing Comey to learn of his firing from media reports – ""was insulting to him and to the entire FBI.""

The NCAA said 17 Division I teams across a variety of sports will be ineligible for postseason play in 2017-18 as a result of low Academic Progress Rate (APR) scores, down from 23 last year.

The APR measures eligibility and progress toward graduation for athletes, and schools must achieve a score of 930 (out of 1,000) to avoid penalties.

Teams ruled ineligible for the postseason tilt heavily toward Historically Black Colleges and Universities, including the men’s basketball programs at Alabama A&M, Grambling and Savannah State. Four teams at Southern University will miss the 2017-18 postseason including men’s baseball, men’s cross country, men’s track and women’s cross country.

However, the NCAA said overall average scores at HBCUs have improved from 916 to 956 since 2010. For the last two years, the NCAA has allowed teams from HBCUs and “limited resource” universities to avoid some penalties by meeting specific academic criteria including a graduation rate for athletes that exceeds the student body at large.

DI student-athletes improved in the classroom for the 13th straight year, according to the Academic Progress Rate: https://t.co/XAbvlCLJh3pic.twitter.com/FyJy2gDwUy — NCAA (@NCAA) May 10, 2017

The NCAA has also allocated additional money to underfunded schools to aid in academic support.

The most high-profile school facing penalties is Southeast Missouri State, whose men’s basketball team is banned from the 2017-18 postseason.

According to the NCAA, the overall four-year APR for the 2015-16 academic year is 981, up two points from last year. Football increased from 959 to 962, while men’s basketball improved from 964 to 966.

From the NCAA report:

The specific penalties for each team are listed on the school’s report in the APR searchable database.

Level One penalties focus on practice restrictions, which provide additional time for teams to focus on academics. Teams facing this penalty lose four hours and one day of practice time per week in season, which is intended to be replaced with academic activities. In 2017-18, 16 teams face this level of penalty.

Level Two penalties include the Level One penalty and a reduction of four hours of practice time out of season, which is intended to be replaced with academic activities. At Level Two, the team’s nonchampionship season, or spring football, is eliminated. Teams without nonchampionship seasons face a reduced number of contests. In 2017-18, 10 teams fall into this category.

3,Erdogan rips U.S. plan to arm Kurds; Mattis downplays Turkey rift,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The YPG is a dominant force within the Syrian Democratic Forces. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

The United States must support its NATO ally Turkey and reverse its decision to arm Syrian Kurds in the battle against the Islamic State, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday.

Erdogan rebuffed U.S. efforts to downplay the ambitious military plan announced Tuesday, saying he would take up the issue with President Trump when they meet in Washington next week.

""A terrorist group cannot be defeated with another one,"" Erdogan said. “I want to believe that Turkey's allies will side with us, not with terrorist organizations.”

Earlier Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he was confident the U.S. can resolve tensions with Turkey, promising to ""work very closely with Turkey in support of their security.""

U.S. officials said Tuesday that Trump approved directly arming the Syrian Democratic Forces, about 50,000 fighters almost evenly divided between Arabs and Kurds. The SDF will be a driving force in the effort to repel ISIS militants from their last major Syrian stronghold in Raqqa. The Kurdish YPG organization, which Turkey views as a terrorist group, is a driving force in the SDF.

Read more:

Turkey says Arabs, not Kurds, should lead the effort to take back Raqqa and wants the Kurds removed from the complicated military equation. The U.S. decision to arm the Kurds drew an outcry across Turkey. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu stressed that ""every weapon they (Kurds) obtain is a threat to Turkey.""

Prime Minister Binali Yidirim said the U.S. still has the ""opportunity"" to alter its position.

“If a negative decision is taken, its consequences will not only be against Turkey but have a negative impact on the U.S., too,” Yidirim said.

Turkish leaders thus far have declined to detail what steps Turkey might take. The U.S. flies military strikes against the Islamic State out of Incirlik, a Turkish base.

Turkey views the YPG as an arm of the leftist Kurdistan Workers' Party, which for decades has pressed a violent struggle for Kurdish self-determination in Turkey. Turkey, the U.S. and European Union all view the Kurdistan Workers' Party as a terrorist group.

The Pentagon policy had been to provide arms only to Arab fighters. The Kurds, however, have proven to be a formidable fighting force. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement Tuesday that arming the entire SDF was ""necessary to ensure a clear victory over ISIS in Raqqa,"" but stressed that Washington understood Turkish security concerns.

“We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the U.S. is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our NATO ally,” White said.

Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Nurettin Canikli dismissed the U.S. reassurances, saying Wednesday that Ankara cannot accept a NATO ally supporting the Kurdish fighters.

“We cannot accept the presence of terrorist organizations that would threaten the future of the Turkish state,"" Canikli said. ""We hope the U.S. administration will put a stop to this wrong and turn back away from it. Such a policy will not be beneficial, you can’t be in the same sack as terrorist organizations.""

9,Maria Sharapova blasts Genie Bouchard without saying a word | FOX Sports,"While Genie Bouchard was putting Maria Sharapova on blast for having the gall to return to the sport after dutifully serving a harsh drug suspension, the five-time Grand Slam champion stayed quiet, refusing to enter the fray. She didn’t bite on questions about the critical comments made by Bouchard or other peers and when she lost to Bouchard in a second-round match this week at the Madrid Open, Sharapova kept on driving the high road, offering a “well done” at the net only to be met with an icy stare from Bouchard, who was awfully pleased with herself in press.

The matter appeared to be put to bed, at least until the next time the two play, until Sharapova threw some of the stealthiest shade imaginable, all with a single tap of a button. It’s glorious.

So, Sharapova has a book coming out in September. It’s called Unstoppable: My Life So Far and is being touted as a memoir about “sacrifice” and “a girl and her father and their crazy adventure.” In recent weeks, Sharapova has occasionally tweeted pictures of the cover.

Then, on Tuesday, one day after the match, a Photoshopped image that appeared to come from this Twitter page made its way around the online tennis community, spoofing the Sharapova cover and her new nemesis.

Get your copy of Genie's book at Barnes & Noble today! #bookcoversmaybe pic.twitter.com/rKYz70gwp2 — The Drive Volley (@thedrivevolley) May 9, 2017

Oh, that’s quite good. A little on the nose maybe but a nice rallying cry for the pro-Masha crowd.

And that was that; just another normal day on Twitter … until:

And … gold. The picture clearly made its way to Sharapova who clearly enjoyed it. Rather than retweet it out to her 5.67 million followers or comment on it, which essentially does the same thing, Sharapova went for the simple “like” option. The benefit of “like” is that the post doesn’t show up on any of Sharapova’s three main pages (tweets; tweets & replies; and media), which helps her maintain a sort of plausible online deniability. Checking to see somebody’s likes isn’t a normal part of the Twitter experience, especially if using Tweetdeck or the phone app. It’s the sort of thing that would go unnoticed by almost everybody – maybe a couple hundred people would have seen it – until one person shares it with everybody else.

The message is still the same. Finally, it’s a counterattack, if only an unspoken one. The whole thing has a sort of impishness that’s classic Sharapova, tacitly saying that all of this is on her terms. She’ll make a small statement like this but won’t provide the soundbite that’ll be replayed ad nauseam. It’s not overt enough to be a salvo but it’s definitive enough to be an ethos. It’s the opposite of Bouchard telling a Turkish TV station that Sharapova should never play tennis again or Serena Williams taking not-at-all-veiled shot at Sharapova in a 2013 Rolling Stone interview. Subtlety is a lost art.

Bouchard had it coming. In addition to the “cheater” who should never “be allowed to play that sport again” from two weeks ago, the 23-year-old Canadian, who was on a seven-match losing streak entering Madrid, said this after defeating Sharapova (in case the scoreline and her Oval Office-like power handshake and icy stare at the net didn’t get the point across):

“Some girls in the locker room are coming up to me and really wishing me good luck before matches, which doesn’t normally happen to me. It showed me that most people have my opinion, and they were just maybe scared to speak out. But privately, you know, I’ve gotten a lot of support.”

That’s some kind of delusional self-martyrdom. (And there’s some doubt about how many people texted, called or approached her – Simona Halep, the former world No. 2, shot her involvement down with such glee: “I didn’t wish good luck to Bouchard because we don’t speak, actually. She’s different.”) Bouchard is a hero because she beat a rusty Sharapova in a second-round match at a second-tier tournament? Maybe in her world, where Sharapova’s cheating, wild cards, unpopularity and status as a fallen idol has become her personal cause, keeping the sport safe from over-the-counter drug users who tested positive for a substance that had been legal 27 days before.

6,Source close to Comey says there were 2 reasons the FBI director was fired,"Washington (CNN) There are two reasons why President Donald Trump fired James Comey, according to a source close to the now-former FBI director:

The official White House version of what happened is that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

But mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russian investigation.

Rosenstein, in his memo, faulted Comey for being unfair to Clinton when he announced his conclusion last July that the case against Clinton should be closed without prosecution. He also criticized Comey for holding a press conference in which he ""Release(d) derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

The official version of the firing is that the President took the advice of the deputy attorney general, who ever since Attorney General Sessions' recusal, oversees the director of the FBI.

""This whole thing is very simple -- you're trying to make it very complex,"" White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on CNN Tuesday morning. ""This is a president who saw that the FBI director had lost the public confidence, the confidence of Republicans and Democrats.""

JUST WATCHED Kellyanne Conway's heated New Day interview Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kellyanne Conway's heated New Day interview 19:24

But we know from his public statements that Trump does not share any of Rosenstein's concerns that Comey was unfair to Clinton. In fact, he faulted Comey for the opposite -- for not criminally charging Clinton.

In addition to that fact, Rosenstein's memo was dated May 9, Tuesday -- but White House officials tell CNN the president had been considering firing Comey since he took office, but most intensely for at least a week before Tuesday's fateful decision. Comey testified May 3 to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Clinton email investigation and the Russia election investigation

If only there was some way for us to see what was on the President's mind in real time last week.

Oh right -- there's Twitter....

Let's take a look at the President's late-night tweetstorm of twitter May 2, just before Comey's testimony.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...""

FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2017

""...Trump/russia story was an excuse used by the democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps trump just ran a great campaign?""

...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2017

Moreover, the letter the President wrote to Comey firing him includes zero references to the Clinton investigation and one big one about the Russia investigation.

The White House does not seem to like any questions about this.

""You want to question the timing of when the President fires, when he hires. It's inappropriate,"" said Conway Wednesday. ""He'll do it when he wants to, just like he fired FBI Director Comey when he was faced with evidence that was unignorable.""

Except of course that evidence about how Comey had treated the Clinton investigation was quite ignorable for the President for more than three months after he took office or until he needed a reason to fire him.

One other point to be questioned has to do with the role of Sessions, who officially removed himself from the Russia investigation as it related to US political campaigns after it became clear he had not been forthcoming about his meetings during the presidential campaign with the Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Still, he cited his own ties to the Trump campaign as the reason for his recusal.

""I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States,"" Sessions said back in March.

Don't call this deal a blockhead move.

Children's programming firm and Teletubbies owner DHX Media said Wednesday that it had acquired a controlling stake in the Peanuts brand and other assets through a purchase of Iconix Brand Group's entertainment unit.

DHX said it had agreed to pay $345 million for the assets, which included an 80% stake in legendary cartoonist Charles Schulz's Peanuts and 100% of the Strawberry Shortcake brand.

Family of the late Schulz will continue to hold a 20% stake in the Peanuts brand, whose characters include Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Lucy.

Jean Schulz, the comic strip creator's widow, and son Craig Schulz endorsed the deal.

Among the assets DHX Media gets through the transaction are more than 340 half-hour segments of content. The company said it had identified opportunities to ""mine an underexploited library for global distribution and expansion into new territories and channels,"" including YouTube.

Under Armour released Newton’s signature cleats to the public on Wednesday for $169.99 — $330 cheaper than Lonzo Ball’s shoes, for what it’s worth – in four different colorways. The most notable, of course, are Newton’s foxtail cleats. Unfortunately, the ones sold by Under Armour don’t include the foxtail, so they’re just wildly colored cleats that make you dizzy when staring at them for more than five seconds.

There’s also a rose gold color, which will go great with your iPhone.

If you’re a gamer, you’ll love these, which feature the button map of a Playstation controller. Why? probably because Newton is a big Madden player.

Last but not least, there’s a purple and gold style, which would look great if you play for LSU or walk the streets of New Orleans.",fox-sports
9,Watch Karim Benzema ruin three Atletico Madrid defenders to set up Real's first goal | FOX Sports,"Atletico Madrid started strong against Real. They really made it look like another Champions League miracle was in the works with their two early goals, and there was hope.

That was until Karim Benzema decided to wantonly ruin the lives of three men without any modicum of compassion, no thought for their futures, and a complete disregard for the feelings of their loved ones.

I’d like to personally issue my condolences to the families of the three defenders whose careers Karim Benzema ended on this day. It can be extremely difficult to soldier on in the face of such abject embarrassment, but I’m here to offer you hope. All is not lost.

Ok, so pride has been lost, the tie is probably lost, the bragging rights of a whole town are lost, and those guys’ ability to walk in any room with their heads held high is probably lost. But, yeah. All is not lost. Keep your head up.

9,Atletico Madrid 2-1 Real Madrid (agg 2-4),"Isco's goal means Real Madrid have scored in 61 consecutive games across all competitions

Defending champions Real Madrid held off a spirited Atletico Madrid to set up a meeting with Juventus in next month's Champions League final in Cardiff.

Atletico, trailing 3-0 from the first leg, stormed into an early 2-0 lead on the night through Saul Niguez's header and Antoine Griezmann's cheeky penalty.

But Real grabbed a vital away goal when Isco smashed in a rebound after Toni Kroos' fierce shot was saved.

It checked Atletico's momentum and left them needing three more goals to reach a third Champions League final in four seasons.

Chances were scarcer for both teams after the break, although home substitute Kevin Gameiro missed two presentable chances to give Atletico a glimmer of hope.

Zinedine Zidane's team, attempting to become the first team to win the Champions League twice in a row, will meet Juventus at the Principality Stadium on Saturday, 3 June.

Too little, too late for Atletico

Most people thought this tie was a foregone conclusion after Atletico were outclassed at the Bernabeu eight days ago.

Los Rojiblancos, who managed just one shot on target in a limp away performance, had other ideas.

Knowing they needed at least three goals to stand any chance of progressing, Diego Simeone's side tore out of the blocks in the opening 20 minutes.

Atletico hassled and harried the visitors, creating gaps in a panicky away defence.

Real keeper Keylor Navas had already saved from Koke inside the opening five minutes before the Atletico midfielder swung in a right-wing corner which Saul met at the near post to powerfully head in.

The visitors had not conceded twice inside the opening 20 minutes of a Champions League match since 2004 - but Griezmann ended that record after Fernando Torres was bundled over by Raphael Varane's clumsy tackle.

Griezmann missed a penalty against Real in last year's Champions League final, as well as two more spot-kicks in La Liga this season, but his Paneka-style chip sneaked past the diving Navas.

La Liga leaders Real looked flustered as the noise was ramped up by the home supporters.

However, they knew one away goal would completely change the complexion of a compelling match - and Isco's opportunist strike did exactly that.

Madrid derby waves farewell to the Calderon

While the chances of Atletico thrashing their illustrious neighbours appeared slim, there was a recent precedent to which Simeone and his players looked for inspiration.

Simeone's side, then the defending La Liga champions, inflicted Real's heaviest league defeat in over four years when they produced a scintillating 4-0 home win in February 2015.

Their fans hoped they could replicate that score and provide what they thought would be a fitting farewell to the Calderon as it hosted a Champions League game for the final time.

Atletico moved into the bowl-like stadium in 1966, but will leave this summer for a state-of-the-art 76,000-seater stadium on the eastern outskirts of the Spanish capital.

The Calderon, famed for its atmosphere, was a cauldron of noise as the home supporters urged their team on to a rapid start.

For many years, the stadium hosted Atletico sides - including the one relegated in 2000 - who struggled to emerge from their shadows of their illustrious neighbours Real.

So, despite Atletico changing the dynamic in recent years under Simeone, it was perhaps quite apt their final meeting with Real there ended in pride but, ultimately, disappointment.

10,Microsoft Build 2017: the biggest highlights and news,"It’s that time of the year again, the time when Microsoft sets aside a few days to celebrate its ardent community of web developers and software engineers. While also announcing a few updates for its various services and platforms including Windows 10 , Office 365 and the Azure cloud computing platform.

The Build conference, as it’s called, took place in Seattle, Washington this year and – in an unexpected twist – the company’s day one keynote was all about the devs.

Build 2017 has been a bit of a shakeup in comparison to previous years where the first day was largely dedicated to consumer technology such as updates to Windows 10 and the Surface devices.

Given that Redmond covered much of that turf in the May 2 #MicrosoftEDU event, it makes sense to kick off Build on the more technically-focused developer side of the fence. Discussions ranged from Microsoft’s efforts in improving artificial intelligence to reflecting on its increasingly growing base of Windows 10 users.

500 million and somehow still counting

The keynote started off with a bang. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella could have dropped the mic when he said that Windows 10 now has 500 million monthly active devices, having grown 25% since last September when the count was 400 million. Although it’s quite the achievement, especially with Windows 10 no longer a free upgrade, it’s a far cry from the one billion Windows 10 users Microsoft hopes to reel in by 2019.

Data on data on data on data

Nadella also disclosed that commercial Office 365 now inhabits 100 million monthly active devices. Back in October of last year, Microsoft confirmed 85 million commercial users, meaning 15 million have since joined the likes of Microsoft’s cloud-based productivity suite.

That number may only increase now that Microsoft has added new functionality to Microsoft Graph , an API that grants developers access to data stemming from Office 365 services and the tools necessary to leverage that data.

Previously, Graph could only provide user and activity data, but now developers can take advantage of device data as well. Not only that, but Microsoft has also implemented a series of new core capabilities into Graph such as ‘Delta queries’ and ‘custom data’.

New Insights APIs are on the way as well, at least in their unfinished preview form, designed for developers to collect better data on how users and documents interconnect. Developers, for instance, will be able to use these APIs to gather intel on the most widely shared documents on OneDrive.

Programming made simple, now for macOS

Though it’s been in preview for quite a few months now, Visual Studio is now available to everyone with a Mac. Unlike Microsoft’s programming environment of old, Visual Studio for Mac derives heavily from the cross-platform IDE from Xamarin, which the company acquired last March.

For this reason, developers will be able to use Visual Studio for Mac to create apps for mobile, Windows and Mac directly from one Apple-branded computer.

You get an AI! You get an AI! Everyone gets an AI!

The other metrics Microsoft shared with us were of the company’s Cortana virtual assistant being being used across 141 million monthly active devices. But the bigger news here was that the company wants to go way bigger with artificial intelligence (AI) than it has already with Cortana. In fact, the company says it wants to bring AI to all of its products and services including Xbox , Windows, Bing and Office just to name a few.

Of course, making a statement this bold is easy. Proof of concept is a much tougher egg to crack. That said, Microsoft explained its ideas quite vividly.

In one example, the company showed AI protecting a workspace by verbally cautioning employees of incidents such as spills.

Alternatively, AI was used to assist workers in finding equipment and communicating more efficiently with teammates. In the future, AI could also be used to track motion for, say, virtual reality gaming and hopefully not a Kinect 3.0.

That’s not where Microsoft’s AI efforts end, however, as the company also revealed the Cortana Skills Kit which we expect to be used in conjunction with the still-unannounced Cortana Invoke speaker said to be made by Harman Kardon.

Using this kit, developers will be able to create their own skills for Cortana (currently for use on Windows 10, Android and iOS) to compete with Amazon’s Alexa. Of course, the Cortana Skills Kit will also come in handy for HP and Intel who have both signed up to create their own hardware powered by Microsoft’s virtual assistant.

A data chamber that’s out of this world

Though Azure is widely known as Microsoft’s platform for cloud computing, it’s also the name of an international database that’s an industry-first in that it exhibits “horizontal scale with guaranteed uptime, throughput, consistency and millisecond latency at the 99th percentile.”

The Azure database, according to Microsoft, was constructed from the ground up to power “planet-scale cloud services.” It even draws its data from the aforementioned Microsoft Graph. Microsoft hopes that the Azure Cosmos database will set the standard for global databases by manifesting the same version of itself everywhere simultaneously, with no regional differences hindering its functionality.

Stay tuned for what’s next at Build 2017

That about covers all of the important reveals from the first day of Microsoft Build 2017. Though today was much ado about showcasing new developer tools, tomorrow is when Microsoft is expected to debut new consumer materials. Maybe we’ll see more Windows 10 announcements or even Microsoft’s own contributions to be added to Cortana.

Who knows? We could even see an official reveal of the Harman Kardon smart speaker tech. No matter the case, you can be sure that it’s covered here on TechRadar as part of our annual coverage of the Microsoft Build conference.

Michael Parks, a veteran character actor memorable in a long career of quirky and award-winning films and TV shows, died Tuesday. He was 77.

His death in Los Angeles was confirmed by his agent, Jane Schulman of Vesta Talent Agency. She did not specify the cause of death but answered, ""Life,"" when asked why he died.

His death also was announced on social media Wednesday by Parks' Tusk and Red State director, Kevin Smith, who hailed him as his ""cinematic muse"" and ""the best actor I've ever known.""

I hate to report that my cinematic muse #michaelparks has passed away. Michael was, and will… https://t.co/55B8wFPujN — KevinSmith (@ThatKevinSmith) May 10, 2017

""I wrote both #RedState and @tuskthemovie FOR Parks,"" he wrote in an Instagram post. ""I loved his acting so much. He was, hands-down, the most incredible thespian I ever had the pleasure to watch perform. And Parks brought out the absolute best in me every time he got near my set.""

Parks also was a favorite of Quentin Tarantino, appearing in his Kill Bill films, and of Robert Rodriguez, who directed him in 1996's From Dusk to Dawn.

Parks also appeared in Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning Argo.

""He was like James Dean,"" Affleck told USA TODAY in 2012. ""He's sexy and amazing and a really good actor. I saw him in Kevin Smith's Red State as this crazy preacher."" Affleck had to trim Parks' role in the film but struggled to keep as much of his scene as possible. ""I couldn't bear to lose it.""

Parks had movie-star looks but he preferred character roles, especially villains, Schulman said. Smith said Parks ""elevated' any film or TV show he was in and any director he worked for.

""I was so ... blessed to have worked with this bonafide genius,"" he wrote. ""But really, I was just lucky to have known him at all. My heart goes out to James (Michael's son), Oriana (Michael's wife), Quentin Tarantino (Michael's biggest fan) and any movie or music lover who was ever dazzled by the talents of Michael Parks. Farewell, old friend. I'll see you farther along...""

Schulman said Parks was known as ""an actor's actor by his peers with a breadth of astonishing range that has allowed him to portray stunning contrasts — sometimes in the same film, like in 2014's Tusk, starring in dual roles as an erudite serial killer opposite Justin Long and as a feeble rube opposite Johnny Depp.""

She said he was in more than 100 films and TV shows over a 50-year career, starting as a contract player in 1961 in the ABC sitcom The Real McCoys. From 1969 to 1970 he starred as a motorcycle-riding hero in Then Came Bronson, and even sang the theme song for the show, Long Lonesome Highway, which was a hit on the Billboard and Hot Country Songs charts, she said.

His other TV series included David Lynch's Twin Peaks in the 1990s and the Dynasty spinoff The Colbys in the 1980s.

In addition to Kill Bill, Parks worked with Tarantino on 2012's Django Unchained and 2007's Death Proof. That same year, he could be seen opposite Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.

At least two of his recent films are in post-production, according to his lengthy IMDb page.

Parks was born in Corona, Calif., on April 24, 1940. According to Schulman, his pre-acting jobs included picking fruit, digging ditches, driving trucks and fighting forest fires. She noted he was a friend to such varied celebrities as Jean Renoir, Johnny Cash and Lenny Bruce, for whom he was a pallbearer.

Four minutes into the match we had our first caution, and two minutes later Atletico Stefan Savic picked up a yellow. The warnings didn't deter the rough-and-tumble play, though. The scrappiness continued as a whopping five cards were doled out in the first half alone.

The key word there is “expected” because there’s absolutely no guarantee he’ll be out there when the season kicks off.

Smith is still recovering from the knee injury suffered in the Fiesta Bowl two years ago as his nerves continue to regenerate, making it difficult to gauge how effective and healthy he’ll actually be in 2017. According to the linebacker himself, though, he’ll be on the field in Week 1 against the Giants.

He said as much on Wednesday at the Cowboys’ annual golf tournament.

Smith has yet to do on-field work with the team, and Jason Garrett doesn’t expect him to do much in rookie minicamp besides walkthroughs and meetings. It’s understandable for the Cowboys to take it extremely slow with their young linebacker, especially with his delicate situation.

He said he’s able to do everything in practice and is “looking tremendous,” but still wears a brace for his drop-foot condition. It remains to be seen whether he’ll need to wear it during the season, which wouldn’t be ideal, saying that will depend on the growth of the nerve.

Jerry Jones shared his thoughts on Smith’s situation Wednesday as well, saying he’ll be a “franchise player that will be around for many, many years.” That’s obviously the hope, and while doctors believe his nerve can regenerate to “maximum potential,” the Cowboys shouldn’t get too far ahead of themselves when it comes to Smith’s future.

Second-ranked Frankie Edgar looks to inch closer to another shot at the 145-pound title when he battles featherweight phenom Yair Rodriguez on the UFC 211 main card. Edgar has been the model of consistency during his more than a decade-long UFC career, having lost to just three fighters total along the way.

Rodriguez is coming off a brutal win over BJ Penn and it would be very difficult not to grant him a title shot if he can get past Edgar. However, he’ll need every bit of his dynamic striking to accomplish such a feat.

6,4 ways Trump miscalculated the Comey firing,"(CNN) Donald Trump has been president for 110 days. In that time, he has fired an acting attorney general, his national security adviser, dozens of federal prosecutors, including one who was investigating him , and, on Tuesday night, the director of the FBI, James Comey.

While each decision has threatened to kick off a crisis -- one could argue that many Americans are now in a perpetual state of minor alarm -- the decision to sack Comey landed differently.

So what did Trump, who is nothing if not savvy about how the press and public will react to his every utterance, think was going to happen? Because this is surely not how he planned his Wednesday. Based on what we know about his decision-making process, Trump appears to have made four fundamental miscalculations.

1. He thought Democrats would pull their punches

It's no secret that most Democrats, especially Clinton supporters and allies, are not exactly Comey superfans. Many of them, including Clinton herself , believe that she would be president today if he had not delivered his now-infamous letter to Congress on October 28, 2016.

As the administration has repeatedly noted, top Democrats were tough on Comey in the aftermath. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was singled out by the White House -- and Trump, in a tweet -- for his harsh words.

Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, ""I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer."" Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

""I'm surprised (Comey's firing) did create a divide since you've had so many Republicans and Democrats repeatedly calling for Director Comey to be gone,"" deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during her Wednesday briefing.

Her remark was meant as a rejoinder to Democratic criticism, but one wonders if she was channeling Trump's very real confusion.

2. He expected Republicans to keep the wagons circled tight

Though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell effectively backed him on Wednesday morning, dismissing Democrats' outrage as mere partisan rancor, and Sens. Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins were supportive, a number of Republicans seemed rattled too.

House Speaker Paul Ryan was silent on the matter for nearly 24 hours before falling in line with McConnell Wednesday evening. And Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, of North Carolina, on Tuesday expressed serious reservations. He wasn't alone.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of director Comey's termination,"" Burr said in a statement. Arizona Sen. John McCain too said he was ""disappointed"" by the firing. Even Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, an early Trump ally, conceded that Comey's ""removal at this particular time will raise questions.""

But it might have been a tweet from Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, no pal of the President, which cut deepest.

I've spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing. I just can't do it. — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) May 10, 2017

""I've spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing,"" he wrote. ""I just can't do it.""

3. He outsmarted himself by trying to use Clinton as a shield

Here is Trump, on October 31, 2016, at a rally Grand Rapids, Michigan. Days earlier, Comey revived the Clinton case in a letter to Congress:

""I really disagreed with (Comey in July when he publicly ended the probe), I was not his fan. But I'll tell you what -- what he did, he brought back his reputation. He brought it back. He's got to hang tough because a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing. But what he did was the right thing.""

JUST WATCHED When Trump praised Comey and the FBI Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH When Trump praised Comey and the FBI 01:07

Eight days later, Trump defeated Clinton.

But in the memo written by Rosenstein, presented by the White House as Trump's rationale for acting, Comey's rough remarks about Clinton at the July 5 press conference are singled out for criticism.

""Compounding the error (of making his decision not to recommend charges public),"" Rosenstein wrote, ""the Director ignored another longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

Simply stated, the suggestion that Trump's decision was swayed in any way by Comey's less-than-stellar treatment of Clinton doesn't pass the smell test.

4. He involved Jeff Sessions, casting doubt on integrity of the Justice Department

Former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions was among Trump's earliest and most influential backers. He was the first in the Senate to endorse the candidate and remained a trusted adviser and surrogate throughout the campaign. But during the attorney general's confirmation hearings in January, he failed to disclose his past contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

When those conversations were revealed, Sessions responded by recusing himself from any investigation into Russia's meddling in the campaign.

But when it came time to explain Comey's dismissal, there was Sessions -- front and center. In a memo citing Rosenstein and addressed to Trump, the attorney general said he had ""concluded that a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI.""",cnn
6,First on CNN: Comey sends farewell letter to friends and agents,"(CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired Tuesday by President Donald Trump, on Wednesday sent a letter to friends and agents. Here is the text of that letter, which was obtained by CNN.

To all:

I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.

I have said to you before that, in times of turbulence, the American people should see the FBI as a rock of competence, honesty, and independence. What makes leaving the FBI hard is the nature and quality of its people, who together make it that rock for America.

It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing. My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.

6,"Comey committed 'atrocities,' Sarah Huckabee Sanders says","Story highlights The press briefing came one day after the abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey

Sarah Huckabee Sanders filled in for press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday

Washington (CNN) FBI Director James Comey committed ""atrocities"" when investigating former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's emails, deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday.

Sanders addressed journalists just one day after President Donald Trump -- citing the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- fired Comey, who was overseeing an ongoing FBI investigation into Russia's interference into the 2016 election. Sanders cited Comey's July news conference which he held without notifying his superiors at the Justice Department.

""I think also having a letter like the one that he (Trump) received, and having that conversation (with Rosenstein) that outlines the basic atrocities in circumventing the chain of command in the Department of Justice,"" Sanders said when asked why Trump's position on Comey changed since the campaign.

""Any person of legal mind and authority knows what a big deal that is, particularly in the Department of Justice; particularly for somebody like the deputy attorney general who has been part of the Justice Department for 30 years and is such a respected person,"" she added.

During the 2016 campaign, Trump commended Comey for his decision to send a letter to Congress that suggested the FBI was looking into Clinton's email server again. Many Democrats cite Comey's handling of the investigation as a major reason for Clinton's loss.

16,Sean Spicer under fire during crucial week for Trump,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is out of the briefing room this week, and already there is speculation about his future.

A White House official told CNN that officials at the highest levels, including the president, are monitoring Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders' performances as she substitutes for Spicer in the briefing room.

The perception, according to multiple sources inside and close to the White House, is that Spicer has been ""benched"" during a critical week, following the president's termination of FBI director James Comey. And the big question, one source said, is whether it's temporary or permanent.

Spicer isn't handling the daily press briefings from Wednesday to Friday while he is fulfilling his Navy Reserve duty at the Pentagon, which the White House says was previously scheduled. A source close to Spicer told CNN that President Trump personally gave him the OK to take leave, and said Spicer will be present at the White House Wednesday night after his duty is done for the day.

But Sanders offered a ""significant contrast"" in the briefing room Wednesday, said another White House official who added Spicer's reserve duty ""couldn't have come at a worse time for him.""

However, another White House official disputed the notion that Spicer had been sidelined, and sources close to the press secretary stressed the importance of his Reserve duties. ""He has taken his Navy duties very seriously in all the time I've known him,"" one source said. ""So if he's on duty, he's on duty, and I wouldn't read more into that in itself.""

Another source close to Spicer added, ""Keep in mind Sean is following military orders, not military suggestions.""

Whatever Spicer's fate, the scrambled effort to address Comey's firing has revealed something significant about this White House, which is that its press secretary is growing increasingly irrelevant.

Already beset by critics who say he has lost his credibility, Spicer may now be losing his authority. His charge is to tell the media, and the public, what the president is thinking. And yet it is becoming increasingly clear that he is either not able to fulfill that task, or choosing not to.

A little more than three hours before Trump fired Comey, Spicer could not say whether his boss still had ""full confidence"" in Comey. ""I have no reason to believe -- I haven't asked him,"" Spicer said at Tuesday afternoon's White House press briefing. ""So I don't -- I have not asked the President since the last time we spoke about this."" Pressed again, Spicer replied, ""I don't want to start speaking on behalf of the President without speaking to him first.""

Later that night, Spicer stood before reporters outside the White House, in the dark, sounding similarly ignorant of his boss's thinking: Had the president spoken with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about Rosenstein's review of Comey, a reporter wanted to know. ""No, I don't believe, I don't know how that sequence went. I don't know,"" Spicer said. When's the last time Trump and Comey spoke? ""I don't know. I don't know,"" he said. ""There's some. I don't know. I don't know.""

Two senior White House officials were sharply critical of the White House press shop's handling of the Comey news Tuesday night. It was an ""embarrassment,"" one official said. ""A disaster,"" said another, who added that the president himself thought it was ""handled poorly.""

The president ""should be mad,"" one official added. This official said sending Sanders into the briefing room was the right call. ""She does a great job,"" the official said.

Spicer is not scheduled to address reporters at all for the remainder of the week. Instead of briefing, he will be at the Pentagon on duty with the Navy Reserve, with which he has served for nearly two decades. That commitment was ""previously scheduled,"" according to White House communications director Mike Dubke.

Already, Sanders has received some praise for her performance from reporters on Twitter. ""Sanders obfuscates same as Spicer,"" The New York Times' Maggie Haberman tweeted. ""Also does it without making deeply personal, petty, condescending.

Politico reporter Josh Dawsey tweeted a similar sentiment: ""Sarah Sanders parries, spins and obfuscates, too. But she's not condescending and seems comfortable at the podium doing it.""

The job of White House press secretary is far more than just the daily press briefing. The press secretary runs the press office, oversees the White House's public statements and press logistics, and manages a team. Even a great briefer could, as a result, be a bad press secretary. But the president's criteria for what he wants in a press secretary may be more limited -- as CNN has previously reported, Trump watches the briefing almost daily.

Spicer's last public appearance on Tuesday night took place outside the White House. Following an interview on the Fox Business Network, he disappeared behind a hedge and huddled with staff in the darkness. He emerged several minutes later to take questions from the reporters standing between him and his office.

""Just turn the lights off,"" he said, according to the Washington Post's account of his impromptu briefing, asking that he not be filmed. ""Turn the lights off. ... Can you just turn that light off?""

He took questions for about ten minutes. On several occasions, he referred the inquiring reporter to the Justice Department. To others, he said he would have to get back to them once he had the full details.

But on several questions, the refrain was simply, ""I don't know.""",cnn
6,Senate intelligence committee subpoenas Michael Flynn,"Washington (CNN) The Senate intelligence committee Wednesday issued a subpoena to former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for documents regarding his interactions with Russian officials.

The subpoena comes after Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, alerted the panel that he would not provide documents in response to their April 28 request.

Flynn's lawyer declined comment to CNN Wednesday evening.

The subpoena also comes as Senate investigators have aggressively moved on their probe after months of groundwork, and just a few days after now-former FBI Director James Comey alerted the leaders of the intelligence panel the FBI was ramping up its own investigation.

Sen. James Lankford, a Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, told Fox News Wednesday evening that the panel had ""subpoenaed a large number of documents.""

6,A 'white hot' Trump stewed over Comey's fate,"(CNN) President Donald Trump kept his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey extraordinarily close to the vest in the 48 hours leading up to the stunning announcement, people close to the White House said, before ultimately concluding that Comey ""was his own man"" and could not be trusted in a role so pivotal to the presidency.

A longtime friend who talked to the President over the weekend described him as ""white hot,"" a mood that set the table for Comey's firing.

Trump did not seek a wide range of viewpoints on Comey, several people familiar with the matter told CNN, unlike his approach on many difficult choices.

Whether sending more troops to Afghanistan or deciding whether to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, the president often embraces opposing positions, but on Comey there was little room for debate inside the West Wing.

White House chief of staff Reince Priebus initially warned of risks associated with abruptly dismissing Comey -- including the fallout for Trump's legislative agenda -- but people familiar with the decision said it was unclear how forcefully Priebus argued his point when it became clear the President was insistent on firing Comey.

""He wasn't doing a good job,"" Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office when asked about Comey. ""Very simply, he was not doing a good job.""

Those sparse words were all the President had to say about why he fired Comey, aside from several messages on Twitter. He did not answer two critical questions about Comey's dismissal: Why and why now?

""The President had lost confidence in Director Comey,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday. ""Frankly he'd been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected.""

Several people familiar with the decision say the President grew increasingly frustrated at Comey after his congressional hearing last Wednesday when he testified that he was ""mildly nauseous"" over the idea that he helped sway the election. Even the health care victory in the House one day later couldn't take his mind off Comey, two people close to Trump said.

""He wouldn't hear it (that he should be encouraged),"" the friend said. ""It's Russia. Russia. Trump and Russia."" The President complained, with expletives, about Comey's ""mildly nauseous"" answer and said his answer when pressed on leaks convinced the President he was far less concerned about the leaks than Trump thought he should be.

Communications team kept in dark

One reason the administration underestimated the explosive fallout, several people close to the White House said, because few seasoned political hands were closely involved in the decision. The White House communications team was kept almost entirely out of the loop until Tuesday afternoon.

Several people close to the White House, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, described it as a stunning and dispiriting turn of events when they were called to defend and explain one of the most controversial decisions of Trump's young presidency ""at almost the same time he pulled the trigger.""

More than 24 hours later, the White House was still explaining the timeline of the Comey decision.

Senior administration officials initially insisted on Tuesday the President was following the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein by firing Comey. The White House, by Wednesday, said the President had long been leery of Comey, despite repeatedly saying he had full confidence in him, and finally made a decision he had been mulling all year.

Both explanations were undercut by the president's own letter to Comey, which made clear Russia investigation was at the root of his frustration.

""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation,"" Trump wrote. ""I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.""

The White House declined to produce evidence of the three separate occasions the president referenced.

Asked whether the president regretted not firing Comey immediately upon taking office, Sanders had a quick answer.

""No,"" Sanders said. ""I think the president wanted to give Director Comey a chance.""

Trump has over the course of past couple months several times expressed frustration ""they can't all just make this go away.""

""He was mad at Sessions when he recused. Really mad,"" the friend said. ""Mad at his lawyer and the staff. Mad at you guys on TV. Mad at the committees. Mad at Comey. """,cnn
6,Rod Rosenstein: Trump's unlikely hatchet man,"(CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein emerged this week as perhaps the most unlikely character in the politically charged drama over the firing of FBI Director James Comey.

Publicly at least, Rosenstein played the role of President Donald Trump's main hatchet man, with the White House pointing repeatedly to his recommendation to terminate Comey as a deciding factor in the president's thinking. It was Rosenstein, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters, who ""brought the recommendation to the president.""

Little in Rosenstein's background suggested such an aggressive or dramatic role.

In more than a quarter-century in government, the Harvard-trained Rosenstein has cultivated an image as a low-key and down-the-middle prosecutor, a political survivor appointed to top jobs by both Democrats and Republicans. ""Straight shooter"" was the innocuous phrase often used to describe him.

First nominated as a United States attorney in Maryland by President George W. Bush, he was so uncontroversial that President Barack Obama kept him on the job. He lasted all eight years of the Obama administration before Trump nominated him for the Justice Department's second-highest post to serve, in effect, as its chief executive officer, and the Senate confirmed him on a 94-6 vote last month in a rare display of near-bipartisanship.

Many senators saw Rosenstein as a sober-minded and independent lawyer who would help steady the Justice Department after the bruising confirmation battle of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose history on race and civil rights became attack points for Democrats. After Sessions' undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador forced him to remove himself from any investigation into the Trump campaign's Russia ties, Rosenstein took over the probe.

Rosenstein and Comey had worked together for years, and at his Senate confirmation hearing in March, Rosenstein showed no sign of reservations about Comey's role at the FBI. He mentioned Comey by name twice in saying he would work with him on sensitive political issues.

But barely two weeks into his new job, all that appears to have changed.

There were conflicting accounts about whether Rosenstein acted on his own or at the direction of the White House. But in the end, he sent over a memo to Trump lambasting Comey's judgment in his public handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

The Justice Department said Rosenstein was not available for comment.

Trump fired Comey late Tuesday just hours after receiving Rosenstein's formal recommendation, which attempted to give the firing a somewhat less raw and political veneer.

Rosenstein's key role in the drama surprised a number of his current and former colleagues at the Justice Department, leaving some to wonder whether he acted on his own or felt obliged to carry out Trump's wishes.

""It's not consistent that he walked in here with a hit list and James Comey's name was on the top of it. That's inconsistent with who he is and what everyone says,"" one law enforcement official said. ""This doesn't pass the smell test of Rod Rosenstein.""

His prominence in the firing also threatened to undermine the integrity of the ongoing Russia probe and to further damage relations between the Justice Department and the FBI, where Comey maintains some support.

""The relationship between FBI and Justice before yesterday was already bad, but after this, it's really toxic,"" said a former federal prosecutor who worked with both Rosenstein and Comey.

Rosenstein's part in the firing drew even more scrutiny Tuesday after reports that Comey had gone to him just last week to seek more resources for the FBI's Russia investigation.

""It just seemed really odd that he would be let go right after that,"" said a former senior FBI agent.

Trump administration officials, however, denied that Comey had asked Rosenstein for more resources for the Russia investigation, and they dismissed any suggestion that Rosenstein's recommendation had anything to do with Russia.

""Everybody across the board has unequivocally said this guy is a man of upstanding character,"" said White House Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, ""and essentially the gold standard at the Department of Justice.""

6,General election 2017: Labour manifesto draft leaked,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC political correspondent Chris Mason takes a look at what's in the leaked draft Labour manifesto

A draft of Labour's general election manifesto has been leaked, including plans to nationalise parts of the energy industry and scrap tuition fees.

The BBC has seen a copy of the document, which is due to be formally signed off on Thursday.

It contains policies on nationalising railways and renewing the Trident weapons system and suggests Labour will not leave the EU without a deal.

Labour would not comment on the leak but the Tories called it ""a shambles"".

According to the draft, Labour would:

Spend an extra £8bn on social care over the next Parliament

Refuse to make ""false promises"" on immigration

Stress that any leader should be ""extremely cautious"" about using Trident nuclear weapons, which leader Jeremy Corbyn opposes

Strengthen trade union rights - including increased unionisation across the workforce and repealing last year's Trade Union Act

Scrap the public sector pay cap and reintroduce national pay bargaining

Ban so-called ""zero hours"" contracts

Increase income tax for the highest earning 5% to raise an extra £6bn for the NHS

Build at least 100,000 council and housing association houses a year

Reserve 4,000 homes for rough sleepers

On energy, Labour would have at least one publicly-owned supplier in every region of the country, with the government controlling the transmission and distribution grids.

First it would introduce an ""immediate emergency price cap"" of £1,000 a year.

The manifesto still has to be approved by around 80 Labour figures, including the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive Committee.

The final version will form the foundation of Labour's pitch to voters on the 8 June general election.

A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""We do not comment on leaks. We will announce our policies in our manifesto, which is our plan to transform Britain for the many, not the few.""

Analysis by BBC political correspondent Chris Mason

The publication of a manifesto is meant to be a huge set-piece moment for any party.

A moment that is choreographed, as what could become their governing manual is published with fanfare.

Instead, on the eve of the draft being formally signed off, a series of leaks, which tell their own story, about the divisions and lack of discipline within a party just four weeks from polling day.

Remember, the final document hasn't yet been signed off.

But there is meaty stuff in this, which some people will delight in seeing a big party advocate at a general election.

Others will label it a throwback to a different political era.

Many of the policies have been previously announced by Labour or were proposed by Mr Corbyn during his successful leadership campaign.

These include banning fracking, and the draft manifesto also says nuclear power would continue to be supported.

On welfare, Labour says it would scrap benefit sanctions and the so-called ""bedroom tax"" and restore housing benefit for people aged under 21.

The triple lock protecting the state pension would be maintained, and the retirement age would not increase beyond 66.

The draft was initially leaked to the Mirror and the Daily Telegraph.

A Conservative spokesman said: ""This is a total shambles. Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed.

""The commitments in this dossier will rack up tens of billions of extra borrowing for our families and will put Brexit negotiations at risk.""

In other general election news, the Conservatives are pledging to continue meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.

Prime Minister Theresa May said she was also extending by two years a pledge to increase the defence budget by at least 0.5% above inflation annually.

Labour is also promising to meet the 2% Nato pledge.",bbc-news
10,Nuisance call firm Keurboom hit with record fine,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Keurboom Communications made automated calls

A cold-calling firm has been fined a record £400,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for making almost 100 million nuisance calls.

Keurboom Communications made unsolicited automated calls relating to road-accident and insurance-policy compensation, the ICO said.

It breached privacy laws by calling people without their consent.

The company has since gone into liquidation but the ICO said it was committed to recovering the fine.

It said it had received more than 1,000 complaints about automated calls from the Bedfordshire-registered company.

Hidden identity

The ICO said Keurboom Communications called some people repeatedly and during unsociable hours.

It also hid its identity so that people would find it harder to complain.

""Keurboom showed scant regard for the rules,"" said Steve Eckersley, head of enforcement at the ICO.

""The unprecedented scale of its campaign and Keurboom's failure to co-operate with our investigation has resulted in the largest fine issued by the Information Commissioner for nuisance calls.""

In October, the Government announced plans to let the ICO fine company directors as well as their businesses.

""Making directors responsible will stop them avoiding fines by putting their company into liquidation,"" the ICO said.

The watchdog said 2016/17 had been its busiest year for nuisance call investigations, with 23 companies fined a total of £1.9m.",bbc-news
3,Austria convicts asylum seeker of Syria war crimes,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The suspect is said to have claimed responsibility for 20 deaths in Homs

An asylum seeker has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a court in Austria after being found guilty of killing 20 people in Syria.

The 27-year-old man was accused of shooting unarmed or wounded soldiers following a battle in the city of Homs.

The man, who has not been named, had denied the charges. He was arrested in western Austria in June.

It is thought to be the first time that a case involving war crimes in Syria have been tried in Austria.

The sentence was handed down by a court in Innsbruck, the Austria Press Agency reports.

Previous reports in local media said the man had told others at a refugee shelter that he had shot dead government soldiers when he was fighting with an Islamist rebel group called the Farouq Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army.

But his lawyers said his account of events was mistranslated and that he was expected to appeal against his conviction.

According to Der Standard, he is a stateless Palestinian who grew up in a refugee camp in Homs.

The suspect was placed under investigation when officials were alerted to his account of events in Syria last year.

Austria is unable to extradite the man to face charges in Syria because of the ongoing civil war there.

Killing injured soldiers is prohibited under the Geneva Convention.

Officials had previously said the actions that he had allegedly described qualified as terrorism and could be prosecuted under international counter-terrorism agreements.",bbc-news
10,Intel and HP to get smart with Cortana-powered devices,"The Build conference is underway in Seattle, and Microsoft is pushing hard with AI and Cortana, with an announcement that both Intel and HP have signed up to produce hardware featuring the digital assistant.

Following in the footsteps of Harman Kardon’s Cortana-powered speaker (Invoke – which is pictured above), HP will also make similar devices, along with Intel – and the latter is promising to knock up reference designs for Cortana-driven devices.

This is according to a TechCrunch report, but other than the actual partnerships and basic intentions of these companies, no details have actually been revealed about the gadgets we might see forthcoming.

We may hear more about HP and Intel’s potential creations as Build progresses, so keep your peepers peeled on TechRadar today and tomorrow.

Smart money

The smart home will potentially be a major market, so it’s little surprise that Microsoft has started to push Cortana into the various IoT gadgets that will furnish said homes.

A big piece of Microsoft’s smart home puzzle was put in place recently with the Creators Update, which brought Cortana support to Windows 10 IoT Core, and thus potentially to all manner of gadgets from smart fridges to thermostats (and indeed the Raspberry Pi 3, for tinkerers building their own smart home stuff).

As for Harman Kardon’s Invoke speaker, that’s expected to be available in the fall. There’s plenty of competition for Microsoft and partners, of course, in terms of Amazon Echo and Google Home.

Move on over Alexa

Also at Build today, Microsoft announced that its Cortana Skills Kit is now in public preview. The kit allows enterprising developers connect their apps and services to Cortana. On stage Microsoft demonstrated a few use cases including ordering pizza through Domino’s, playing music on iHeartRadio and looking up only the most important information on Cat Facts.

What's more, Microsoft promises they will work across platforms including Windows 10, Android and iOS, as well as with standalone Cortana devices like the Invoke.

10,Sprint joins the race to roll out 5G with plans for 2019,"Not wanting to be left behind by the likes of AT&T and Verizon, another major telecom company is making plans to support 5G connectivity.

Sprint announced today that it's made a joint agreement with Qualcomm and SoftBank to build new technologies for a 2.5GHz 5G service.

The carrier plans to have commercially available 5G services and devices ready for the public sometime ""in late 2019,"" but had little else to add, saying that additional details will be provided later by either itself and its partner companies.

5G may be on its way, but it won't be an overnight process. AT&T has not yet given a definitive time frame when to expect a 5G rollout, and Verizon is still prepping a pilot program in a limited number of cities for later this year.

Sprint's jump into 5G technologies also follows just over a week after T-Mobile's announcement to roll out 5G services of its own, which expects to have something commercially available starting in late 2019 and into 2020.

T-Mobile CEO John Legere made claims that his company was the first among competitors to announce plans for ""truly nationwide"" 5G, saying that AT&T and Verizon's current plans-in-development rely too much on limited hotspots instead of wide-spread coverage.

As for Sprint, it's unclear if its plans for ""accelerated wide-scale 5G deployments"" more closely match T-Mobile or AT&T/Verizon's strategy, but one thing is clear: the race to the next cellular standard is on — even if we won't see major results for at least another two years.",techradar

6,Comey's fired. Here's what we know about probes into Trump campaign and Russia,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey raises a ton of questions, including how this will affect the FBI and congressional investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 elections.

Here's what we know — and what we still don't know.

Why did Trump fire Comey?

First, let's start off with the basics.

In recommending Comey's firing, the Justice Department leadership excoriated the FBI director for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State.

In a letter released by the White House, Trump said he agreed with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and newly-confirmed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Comey ""was not able to effectively lead the bureau."" As Trump told reporters on Wednesday: ""Very simply, he was not doing a good job.""

But wasn't he running the FBI's Russia investigation?

Yes. Comey in March confirmed publicly the FBI was conducting a counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year's election. Trump has repeatedly denied any connections and has dismissed the Russia story as a ""hoax"" from Democrats committed to sabotaging his presidency.

White House aides spent all of Wednesday arguing the timing of the firing had nothing to do with the agency's ongoing investigation.

Where does the FBI's Russia probe stand now?

That's what everyone wants to know.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the Russia investigations will ""continue whether Jim Comey is there or not.""

“Any investigation that was happening on Monday, is still happening today. We encourage them to complete this investigation so we can put it behind us,” Sanders told reporters Wednesday. “Nobody wants this to be finished and completed more than us.”

But Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., expressed concern on Wednesday that the investigation would continue in full force, confirming reports that Comey had asked for more money for the FBI's probe of Russia's interference in the election days before being fired. “I’m told that as soon as Rosenstein arrived, there was a request for additional resources for the investigation and that a few days afterwards he (Comey) was sacked,"" said Durbin, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Justice Department and FBI.

Durbin said he did not know the details of the request, which The New York Times reported the FBI director made to Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the Russia investigation who also recommended Trump fire Comey. Durbin also said he did not have direct evidence that the request was related to Comey’s firing. But he had a general takeaway: “I think the Comey operation was breathing down the neck of the Trump campaign and their operatives and this was an effort to slow down the investigation.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said Comey made no request for additional funding or personnel in meetings with Rosenstein. “No resources — personnel, money or otherwise,’’ Flores said. “That is false.’’

If the FBI doesn't investigate, who could?

Democrats are unifying around the call for a special prosecutor. If Trump were truly upset with Comey about his handling of the Clinton probe, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, he could have fired Comey on his first day in office. Instead, Schumer said, the president waited until Congress and FBI investigations into Russia heated up.

""Given the way the President has fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration,"" Schumer said. Without an independent special prosecutor, he added, ""every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up.""

How would a special prosecutor be appointed?

Not easily, it turns out.

The responsibility would fall to Rosenstein, who wrote Tuesday’s memo justifying Comey’s firing. While Attorney General Jeff Sessions has legal authority to make the appointment, he has recused himself from investigations relating to the 2016 campaign after his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, came to light.

The post-Watergate independent counsel law that gave Congress the authority to call on the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor lapsed in 1999. And passing a new version is unlikely in a GOP-controlled Congress.

An independent counsel isn’t needed, Sanders said, because Congress is also investigating — and because Rosenstein, who is overseeing the Justice Department’s probe, “is about as independent as it comes.”

On Wednesday afternoon, Schumer said Rosenstein’s role in Comey’s dismissal had cast “serious doubts” on his impartiality. Democrats now say the authority to name a special prosecutor should fall instead to the highest-ranking career civil servant at the Justice Department.

So will Congress take any action, then?

There are five key committees looking at aspects of Russia's involvement in the election.

After the U.S. intelligence community accused Moscow of orchestrating a campaign of cyberattacks against Democratic political organizations, and leaking the stolen information to websites such as WikiLeaks with the goal of undermining public confidence in the election, congressional panels offered to take up the charge.

So far, though, there have been some hearings, but little definitive progress — at least that's visible to the outside observer.

Here's where things stand:

Senate Intelligence Committee:

The committee hasn’t held open hearings on its Russia probe since it heard from some academic witnesses on Russian “disinformation” efforts on March 30.

On May 5, committee leaders asked four Trump campaign associates — including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign advisers Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone — to provide records of meetings with Russian officials. The committee announced late Wednesday that it sent a subpoena to Flynn for Russia-related documents.

Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday night that he was “troubled by the timing” of Comey’s firing, adding it “confuses an already difficult investigation.” Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said it was “shocking” that Comey was fired “during an active counterintelligence investigation into improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia.” He tweeted that the situation ""demands the appointment of a Special Counsel.""

But some members of this investigating panel might not support a special prosecutor. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the panel, said Wednesday such an appointment “would probably shut down our ability to do our work because a significant amount of information would now be denied on the basis of an ongoing investigation.” He urged patience in letting the committee continue its work.

Comey has been invited to testify before the committee during a closed hearing next Tuesday.

House Intelligence Committee:

This panel’s effort is stalled, with staff continuing to go through evidence but no hearings scheduled. After Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., recused himself from the probe and handed the matter over to Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, the committee heard from Comey in a May 4 closed session — but that's about it.

Nunes stepped aside after reviewing evidence at the White House he said proved some Trump associates were inadvertently caught up in surveillance by the intelligence community of legitimate foreign agents during the presidential transition. Nunes shared that information with Trump — before informing fellow committee members, prompting calls for his ouster.

With this as a backdrop, the panel's top Democrat, Adam Schiff of California, questioned whether the White House was inappropriately interfering in the probe after Comey’s firing Tuesday. ""The decision by a president whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an attorney general who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,” he said.

Conaway spokeswoman Emily Hytha said he has not addressed the Comey firing, adding the committee’s investigation will continue “as planned.”

Senate Judiciary Committee:

This committee, which has been one of the most publicly active in its investigation, hosted two hearings that provided critical information in recent days.

The hearing with Comey appeared to be part of the impetus for his eventual firing. On May 3, Comey said in his appearance before the panel that “hundreds and thousands"" of emails had ended up on former New York congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop because of Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin. Comey said Abedin made a ""regular practice"" of forwarding emails to her now-estranged husband.

But it turned out that Comey misspoke. After ProPublica reported Monday night that his testimony was not accurate, the FBI issued a statement the next day to the committee attempting to clear things up. That was just hours before Comey’s firing was announced.

Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Tuesday it was within Trump’s right to fire Comey after the FBI director had lost the public’s trust. Grassley also criticized the way Comey had provided information to the committee. But ranking member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., praised the way Comey had worked with the panel, calling a past briefing “comprehensive” and “precise.”

On Monday, Senate Judiciary panel hosted former acting attorney general Sally Yates and former director of national intelligence James Clapper. In that hearing, Yates told lawmakers that she was so concerned that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with the Russian ambassador that she warned the White House counsel he was vulnerable to blackmail and could even face criminal charges. Eighteen days later, Flynn was fired.

House Judiciary Committee:

In a non-binding list of activities the committee adopted for the year, the panel promised to “continue to conduct oversight into allegations of misconduct” by the executive branch. Other than that, there hasn’t been much public movement.

Following Tuesday’s developments, ranking member John Conyers, D-Mich., said Comey’s firing “obliterates any semblance of an independent investigation into Russian efforts to influence our election, and places our nation on the verge of a constitutional crisis.” Yet Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., pointed to the recommendations of the attorney general and deputy attorney general in encouraging Trump to fire Comey. “The FBI is the premier law enforcement agency in the world and it is critical to have a director who holds the trust of the American people,” he said.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee:

Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and ranking member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., sent shockwaves through Washington when the they announced last month that Flynn may have broken the law in relation to payments he accepted from Russia for speaking engagements. They came to that conclusion after the committee viewed classified documents related to Flynn.

Cummings said the White House had refused their requests for documents related to Flynn’s tenure. There is ""no data to support the notion that Flynn complied with the law,” Chaffetz said at the time. A Chaffetz spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Comey’s firing, while Cummings called for “immediate emergency hearings to obtain testimony directly from Attorney General Sessions, the deputy attorney general, and FBI Director Comey” for answers.

“There is now a crisis of confidence at the Justice Department, and President Trump is not being held accountable because House Republicans refuse to work with us to do our job,” Cummings said Tuesday.

The parent company of Fox News Channel, Twenty-First Century Fox, has paid $45 million in settlements related to sexual harassment allegations against former CEO Roger Ailes.

In its quarterly report filed Wednesday with the Securities & Exchange Commission, 21st Century Fox (FOX) listed costs of about $45 million during the nine months before the quarter ended March 31, 2017 for ""settlements of pending and potential litigations following"" Ailes' July 2016 resignation and a sexual harassment case filed against him. That's $10 million more than in its previous quarterly report.

Among those payments: a $20 million settlement in September 2016 of former Fox and Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson's sexual harassment lawsuit she filed against Ailes.

The company, which is controlled by billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch, continues to seek to recover from a sexual harassment crisis that resulted in several high-profile departures.

Most recently came last week's resignation of network co-head Bill Shine, who had been mentioned in several lawsuits filed against Fox News for allowing a workplace culture in which sexual harassment and racial discrimination could develop. Shine had taken over as co-president along with Jack Abernethy in August 2016, one month after CEO Roger Ailes stepped down in the wake of accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination.

Last month, popular host Bill O'Reilly was dismissed after an internal investigation into charges of sexual harassment.

But the Murdochs say Fox News Channel has powered through, remaining the No. 1 basic cable channel in total day and primetime viewing for 61 consecutive quarters. ""Fox News Channel has delivered its highest-rated quarter ever, ratings strength we expect to continue,"" said Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch in a conference call Wednesday with investment analysts

Fox (FOX) shares dipped nearly 2% in after-hours trading to $27.20 after the company posted mixed third-quarter earnings results Wednesday.

Net income of $799 million fell 5%, with adjusted earnings per share of 54 cents, compared to 44 cents last year.

Revenue rose 4.6% to $7.56 billion, short of forecasts. Analysts had expected net income of $883.75 million, according to those polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, along with adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents and revenue of $7.63 billion.

6,Senate Democrats seek Comey’s testimony amid new questions about his ouster,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned the timing and motive behind President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.

WASHINGTON — Former FBI director James Comey has been invited to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee during a closed hearing next Tuesday, as the fallout from his sudden and surprising ouster continued to ripple across the Capitol.

President Trump’s Tuesday decision to fire Comey as he led a counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government had Democrats, and even some Republicans, questioning the president’s motives.

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, suggested that Comey could personally confirm that he had asked the Justice Department, shortly before his firing, for additional resources to advance the ongoing Russia investigation. Justice Department official dispute such a request.

“Wouldn’t it be a good idea for Director Comey to come in and testify to that issue?’’ Warner said Wednesday.

The Senate’s Democratic leader, Charles Schumer of New York, said reports that Comey met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week to request more resources for the probe ""would make the timing of this firing even more suspect.""

Schumer said Comey must come before the Senate ""in some capacity,"" and he pressed Republicans on Wednesday to convene two private and possibly classified briefings for all senators, where they could separately grill Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation earlier this year. Both Sessions and Rosenstein recommended Comey's dismissal.

“There are a great many outstanding questions about the circumstances of Comey’s dismissal,” Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor.

Schumer’s request for a classified briefing was a “surprise” and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will need more information about the request before he’s ready to comment on it, said Don Stewart, McConnell's spokesman.

Read more:

McConnell, in his own remarks opening the Senate for legislative business on Wednesday, accused Democrats of hypocrisy for objecting to Comey’s firing.

McConnell noted that many Democrats were furious with Comey for his handling of the investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Some Democrats had previously called for Comey’s resignation after the FBI chief’s public remarks about the Clinton probe, saying his move was at least partly responsible for Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential race.

Comey was removed “for many of the reasons (Democrats) consistently complained about,” McConnell said.

But Schumer and other Democrats expressed deep skepticism about the Trump administration’s statements that Comey was fired for his controversial handling of the Clinton investigation.. They point to Comey's ongoing probe into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 election on behalf of Trump and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the outcome.

""At a minimum, the decision to fire Comey raises questions about the appropriateness and timing of firing the person in charge of an investigation that could — I won’t say would, but could — implicate the administration,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the Senate Judiciary Committee's highest-ranking Democrat.

Comey's ouster prompted Democrats to slow down Senate business and ramp up their calls for a special prosecutor to be appointed for that investigation — a move that McConnell and other Republicans have dismissed as unnecessary. Schumer said Senate Democrats agree that the Justice Department's highest-ranking career civil servant — not Rosenstein — should be responsible for appointing a special prosecutor because ""serious doubt has been cast on Mr. Rosenstein's impartiality.""

McConnell said opening a new probe would “only serve to impede the current work being done” by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Democrats, hoping to pressure Republicans into supporting the appointment of special prosecutor, forced the postponement of several Senate committee hearings by invoking a rule that allows senators to prevent meetings longer than two hours after the Senate convenes.

""We're trying to get the focus on what we consider to be a historic event that happened last night,"" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Democrats are prepared to take steps to force a vote on legislation to create an outside, independent commission if House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., won't call up the bill for a vote. Democrats are working on similar legislation in the Senate.

""If the president has nothing to hide, then he should welcome the creation of a commission providing an independent investigation to remove all doubt of a coverup,"" Pelosi wrote in a letter Wednesday to Democratic colleagues.

At an afternoon visit at a packaging plant in Ohio, Ryan ignored multiple questions shouted by reporters about Comey’s firing and the Russia investigation. “The people in the press, they’re here because they want to hear me talk about tax reform,” he joked at the start of a roundtable discussion with business owners. “I’ll be making statements later about the questions that they all have.”

Comey had been scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence panel on Thursday, but acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe will now appear in his place, according to Schumer.

Democrats said Comey should still appear so he can answer questions about the status of the FBI’s probe and its potential connection to his dismissal.

“It’s extremely important that Mr. Comey come to an open hearing in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence as quickly as possible and testify as to the status of the U.S-Russian investigation at the time of his firing,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the panel.

Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., reiterated his concerns about Trump’s decision to fire Comey and said it would complicate but not stop the Senate investigation.

“The timing of this and the reasoning for it doesn’t make sense to me,” Burr said of Comey’s ouster.

Vice President Pence, during a visit to the Capitol on Wednesday, defended Comey’s firing. “Right decision, right time,” Pence said as he walked past reporters outside the Senate chamber.

Even as McConnell defended Trump’s decision, several other Senate Republicans raised pointed questions about Comey’s firing.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the timing of the FBI chief’s ouster was “serious cause for concern.” And Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said the administration needed to provide more details about its reasons for the move.

“Given the timing and circumstances of the decision, I believe the White House should provide a fuller explanation regarding the president’s rationale,” Portman said. “The American people must have faith in a strong, independent FBI. I’m concerned about eroding trust in this premier law enforcement agency.”

Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it is “incumbent” upon the White House to pick a new FBI chief who can win bipartisan support.

“It has to be someone who people on both sides of the aisle will have a lot of faith in,” Corker said. “The ball’s in their court right now … to bring forth someone who all quarters will say is the right person at this particular time in our history.”

16,What would it take to get you off your sofa and into a movie theater?,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Movie fans are starting to see better food, heated recliners and buy one, get one ticket sales! Wochit

(Photo: Eric Curtis, Universal CityWalk)

LOS ANGELES — The recent grand unveiling of Universal Cinema after its multimillion-dollar renovation was a true Tinseltown affair.

After cutting the ribbon for the flagship AMC theater near Universal Studios Hollywood, celebrity guests such as Steven Spielberg and Jordan Peele hit the Director's Lounge, which now provides full bar service and gourmet food (fruit smoothies, anyone?). All 18 auditoriums boast Dolby Atmos surround sound and laser projection, viewed from 1,930 new luxury recliners.

It sounds like Hollywood extravagance, but movie theaters nationwide are touting similar state-of-the-art amenities to attract customers in the face of stiff entertainment competition from streaming services and mobile devices.

Box office reached an all-time high of $11.37 billion in 2016, thanks to rising ticket prices, but attendance is essentially flat: 1.33 billion tickets sold last year, up only slightly from 2015's 1.32 billion, according to comScore.

With admissions up a mere .02% from this time last year, and the crucial summer movie season at hand, the need for outreach is clear.

""Theaters are fine-tuning every option they have to make it more appealing and lure moviegoers. They are trying to make that movie night out an experience people will come back to again and again,"" says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. ""Better seats, food options and drink are a big part of that.""

Here are a few of the cutting-edge efforts to get customers off their couches and into theaters.

The theater seat revolution heats up

The most dominant theater trend is comfort. The standard pull-down theater seat is giving way to plush luxury recliners, often with leg rests, cup holders and the ability to transform into a two-person loveseat.

""If you're going to pay $20 for a ticket, (you) want luxury chairs,"" says Bock. ""Theaters are providing the ultimate experience in comfort that people just can't get at home.""

AMC, the country's largest theater chain, has installed luxury recliners in more than 200 of its 600 theaters, with most of these auditoriums entirely upgraded to the premium chairs, says spokesman Ryan Noonan. He says ""a majority"" of the $420 million AMC spent on theater upgrades in 2016 went into this seating.

The chain is even turning up the heat. Noonan tells USA TODAY that AMC will start incorporating luxury seats with personal heaters in pilot locations this summer, ""with more planned in the next few years.""

There's a year-round need for the seat warmers, says Stephen Simons, founder and CEO of industry leader VIP Cinema Seating. ""Funny enough, even in places like Florida, air-conditioned theaters can get cold,"" he says.

Regal Theaters is incorporating ""buttkickers"" into the king-size seats at a dozen of their RPX premium theaters. They feature built-in woofer speakers that vibrate, bringing the viewer into the action.

In addition to power recliners, the 16 iPic theaters nationwide are rolling out double ""pod"" seating, which allows couples to dine privately on built-in tables (with cabinets to stow shoes and bags). The chain is also bringing out double chaise lounge chairs that allow moviegoers to stretch their feet.

The reclined lounges, placed up front, have turned an previously unpopular seating area into prime real estate — and are free from the dreaded neck cricks that traditionally accompany front-row viewing.

""People want the comfort and to be treated like it's still an experience to go to the theater,"" says Dave Andreadakis, chief strategy officer at Kobie Marketing. ""Theaters have done a wonderful job responding to that need with these luxury seats.""

Theater food gets even fancier

AMC is overhauling its food menu this June, a national rollout that includes trendy chicken-and-waffle sandwiches, a spicy Sriracha dog, gourmet popcorn, stone-fired flatbread pizzas (four cheese, pepperoni, barbecue chicken and buffalo chicken) and gluten-free snacks.

""This is a big sign from the industry leader just how important the expanded menu is to theaters,"" says Daniel Loria, editor for the theater trade publication BoxOffice.

Dine-in locations like the Dallas-based Studio Movie Grill have continued to step up their game, adding seared Ahi tuna and blackened chicken pasta to the popular coconut chicken tenders and seasoned edamame at their 26 locations. iPic theaters feature Hollywood chef Phil Rosenthal's gourmet mac and cheese fries during the month of May, part of a rotating gourmet menu.

Theaters are tailoring the food around films. At Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas, the menus change with the blockbusters. The theaters' 27 national locations are currently serving ""I am Froot"" shakes inspired by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, while the Croque Maurice French bistro sandwich earned its spot among the most popular menu items during the run of Beauty and the Beast.

""These expanded concessions give the opportunity for movie theaters to draw customers and increasingly become a one-stop entertainment option for a night out,"" says Loria.

Adult beverages go upscale

Alcohol sales have become the hot concession, with trade publication The Hollywood Reporter calling booze ""the new popcorn"" — the result of 32 states relaxing restrictions on serving alcohol in theaters over the past two years.

The drinks have gone next-level innovative: The Heisenberg Liquor Infusion Tower blew steam into iPic theaters in January, using liquid nitrogen to flavor exotic cocktails with fresh fruits.

Cinépolis USA has seen up to 5% growth year-over-year with alcohol sales, which are expected to make up 28% of its food and beverage sales in 2017. The group unveiled its Cinépolis Rose wine this summer, an extension of its private wine label (slogan: “Sit back. Relax. Escape”).

Seven full-liquor Cinépolis theaters will serve a color-appropriate Wonder Woman blue martini (with red raspberries) around the film's June 2 release, part of the rise of blockbuster-themed cocktails.

AMC theaters will show off The Gauntlet cocktail for Wonder Woman (vodka, grenadine, house-made lemonade and Blue Curacao) and the Banana Hammock for Baywatch (banana rum, pineapple juice, Sprite).

The tentpoles are tied to specially-brewed beer, too. Flix Brewhouse, the brewery cinema chain based in Round Rock, Texas, is selling a Groot-inspired Flora Colossus beer for Guardians 2, a double IPA with plenty of plant hops.

""Alcohol is a new, increasingly visible dimension in the moviegoing experience,"" says Loria. ""It's appealing to adult moviegoers and highly profitable.""

Virtual reality is a moviegoing reality

Ahead of The Mummy (in theaters June 9), there's the Mummy Zero Gravity Stunt VR Experience, which virtually takes participants along with Tom Cruise on the zero-g flight seen in the movie's audacious plane action sequence. It's been a promotional hit at events like South by Southwest festival and CinemaCon, the national convention for theater owners, and will open to the public at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York starting Memorial Day weekend.

Regal Theaters in 15 cities will host kiosks featuring Alien: Covenant In Utero, a new VR experience that gives a terrifying 360-degree view of the birth of the killer creature from director Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant (May 19).

IMAX opened its first standalone VR Experience Centre in L.A. in January, offering immersive VR experiences built around movie franchises such as John Wick and Star Wars. These IMAX VR centers are headed to three cinema complexes (two in New York, one in L.A.) in 2017, with plans for five internationally in the works.

The tie-in is more powerful when the experience features upcoming releases. IMAX is working on VR experiences around future behemoths such as Justice League (in theaters Nov. 17) and Aquaman (Dec. 21, 2018).

""It's the next big. This is truly immersive,"" says Bock. ""Importantly, it's something that excites millennials. Getting them off their phones (and) into theaters is key moving forward.""

Event nights provide a big lift to attendance

With niche specialties ranging from live theater performances (The Met Opera: Live series), a partnership with TCM Classics for movie revivals, sporting events and anniversary releases (Dirty Dancing's 30th), Fathom Events is quietly growing into a serious player.

Fathom put on 131 unique events in theaters in 2016 (up from 2013's 55), seeing revenue grow from $36.4 million to $55.3 million and attendance rise from 2.1 million to 3.6 million.

Already in 2017, Fathom has hosted 14 million-dollar events — matching 2016's total and making Fathom the country's 12th largest distributor, according to comScore.

""It's like 'Holy cow, these numbers are huge.' They are a growing force to be reckoned with,"" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore, who points out that many events are on weeknights, which are slow evenings in theaters. ""It's a niche market, but a powerful one with limited supply and a lot of demand.""

Convenient ticket purchasing

Online ticket sales are following the audience to mobile devices via apps such as industry leader Fandango (70% of its sales are on mobile devices) and Atom Tickets (which allows users to poll friends on movie selections and pre-purchase snacks at the theater).

Fandango is pushing forward with voice-enabled ticket purchasing on every platform (from Facebook Messenger bots to Amazon's Alexa), executives said Tuesday at San Francisco's SuperBot conference.

The platform even offers ""worry-free"" ticketing, which allows for a full refund on advance tickets right up to showtime.

Apps allow assigned seating, taking the unknowns out of the movie equation. ""People want to sit in the seats they want to sit in,"" says Bock.

Of all the theater amenities, Peele finds this the most alluring.

""I like this,"" says the ""app-oriented"" actor and filmmaker ""It's nice to go and not have to jockey for position, so having the seats in advance is key. That and caramel corn, if I can get it.""

Former Olympic gold medalist Henry Cejudo has been forced out of his fight with Sergio Pettis and the bout has been scrapped from the card on Saturday night in Dallas.

The change was announced via “UFC Tonight” on Wednesday following an initial report from MMAFighting.

With the fight card just a few days away, no replacement will be sought for Pettis, who has been pulled from the show without an opponent.

The middleweight matchup between Krzysztof Jotko and David Branch will be bumped up to the main card from the prelims with the bout pitting Jared Gordon against Michel Quinones now moving to the preliminary card on FX kicking off at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday night.

It’s an unfortunate turn of circumstances as Cejudo was looking to bounce back from a pair of losses while Pettis was trying to get into title contention following his recent three-fight win streak.",fox-sports
9,Cardinals reportedly will sign QB Blaine Gabbert to a one-year deal | FOX Sports,"The Arizona Cardinals are adding a little insurance at quarterback, reportedly signing Blaine Gabbert to a one-year deal.

Former 49ers' and Jaguars' QB Blaine Gabbert is signing a one-year deal with the Arizona Cardinals, per source. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) May 10, 2017

Blaine Gabbert is expected to sign a 1-year deal with the #Cardinals tomorrow, source said. — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) May 10, 2017

Gabbert started five games last season with the 49ers, completing 57 percent of his passes for 925 yards with five touchdowns and six interceptions in 2016. The 27-year-old is set to join his third team after being taken with the 10 pick in the 2011 draft by the Jaguars.

The Cardinals gave starter Carson Palmer a one-year extension earlier this offseason after throwing for 4,233 yards with 26 touchdowns and 14 interceptions last year. Gabbert likely will compete with Drew Stanton for the backup role in Arizona.

Gabbert won the starting job at the beginning of last season with the 49ers only to be replaced by Colin Kaepernick, who is still unsigned. Gabbert ended the year third on the 49ers’ depth chart behind Kaepernick and Christian Ponder.",fox-sports

9,Eddie Alvarez explains what it took to get past the loss to Conor McGregor | FOX Sports,"Regret is like a disease that can fester, and former lightweight champion Eddie Alvarez understands that concept better than most.

Last November, Alvarez truly believed he was going to dish out a savage beating to Conor McGregor while defending his lightweight title for the first time in one of the biggest UFC events in history.

Instead, Alvarez suffered arguably the most lopsided loss of his entire career as McGregor knocked him down several times over the course of the fight before finishing him in the second round.

Alvarez suffered from Murphy’s Law that night — the idea that what can go wrong, will go wrong — but seven months later as he approaches his next fight at UFC 211 he makes no excuses for what happened in the fight with McGregor.

“I think I got hit with a punch. Media likes to [ask] what happened or trying to make things a little more difficult than what they are,” Alvarez explained when speaking to FOX Sports. “Fighting’s unique, you can prepare a million times, you can know everything that you’re going to do but you get hit with a shot, you get stupid for a little bit, make some bad decisions, things go bad quickly and that’s what happened on November 5.

“I’m over it. I’ve forgiven myself and I’m excited to get back in there and redeem myself.”

Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

With a new fight just days away, Alvarez would prefer to look forward rather than look back, but he knows the loss to McGregor is going to be a big topic of discussion for him this week in Dallas.

No matter what’s being said, Alvarez knows it can’t be any worse than what he already told himself in the aftermath of that fight and that’s probably what helped him finally move past it all.

“I think there was too much nerves involved and never really got a chance to settle into the fight. I enjoy fights the most once them nerves go away and you settle into the fight. That’s when you can have your fun and be creative and just kind of be yourself. I’m looking forward to doing that this weekend,” Alvarez said.

“I’m my own biggest critic so no matter what was being said in the media or being said by fans, I feel the worst when I disappoint myself. I put my heart and soul into it so when I don’t go out there and it doesn’t manifest in the way I prepared for, I’m heartbroken. I used that energy, I used that disappointment to fuel me in this next upcoming bout.”

Alvarez says he was in “bad shape” in the days following the loss to McGregor but he eventually found a way to even turn that defeat into a positive for the rest of his career.

In a strange way, Alvarez says living through the worst possible situation has prepared him to bring the best out in his fight this weekend with Dustin Poirier.

“Having something like your worst nightmare come true it’s liberating. There’s a freedom in it. I feel free. Now I feel I can step inside this cage and I don’t know if I can feel any worse than I’ve already felt. I feel like I can just be myself,” Alvarez said.

“Just be forgetful. It’s in the past. There isn’t much you can do about it and just focus in on the things that you can control. I’ve done that. I’ve focused on the present moment. I’ve focused on what I can control right now and what I can control on Saturday. I have a good feeling.”",fox-sports

6,Comey firing sends shockwaves through FBI rank-and-file,"Washington (CNN) News of James Comey's firing Tuesday night sent shockwaves through the FBI, where the dismissal of the generally well-liked bureau director immediately impacted the thousands of agents nationwide.

The reaction was not universal. Some in the agency resented the political spotlight Comey had brought on the bureau with his public statements at the center of the Russia and Clinton investigation firestorms.

But many felt loyalty to Comey and appreciated his independence to both sides of the political aisle, especially with critical comments President Donald Trump made about the intelligence community during the campaign and early in his presidency, as well as the former director's efforts to streamline administrative processes.

In the wake of the firing, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe sought to reassure agents Wednesday that the bureau would continue to do its work, according to two officials familiar with the call.

McCabe spoke via secure conference call with top officials in the FBI's field office around the country Wednesday afternoon, according to the officials. He spoke briefly and told them to focus on the FBI's mission. McCabe also met with Trump at the White House Wednesday afternoon, where White House officials said the President would discuss FBI morale.

One agent called a CNN reporter in tears Tuesday night to say that FBI morale had never been better under Comey -- and that now it had plummeted. Some said they feel like they've lost a family member.

Despite White House claims that Comey had lost the support of his FBI staff, recent former officials disputed the idea that he had anything but respect.

Recently retired assistant director of the national security branch, Michael Steinbach, who oversaw the Russia probe said the claim that the FBI had a morale problem under Comey is ""inaccurate.""

Comey is ""a man of integrity"" who was ""a strong leader in the organization and entirely respected with the rank and file across the FBI,"" Steinbach said. ""Of course in any situation you have a variety of viewpoints and it's fair to say not everyone agreed with him, but his reputation was that of a respected leader in the organization.""

The move will have consequences with agents, though, another former official said.

""It's pretty damaging, and it's demoralizing, and this move I think further separates what should be everybody kind of on the same team,"" said a former FBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to sensitivities of the situation. ""It separates the administration from the intelligence community and law enforcement.""

News of the firing came Tuesday evening, and Comey learned of his firing from television as he met with agents in Los Angeles. As the news flashed on TV screens behind him, he joked about it being a prank, then shook agents' hands as he stepped aside to get the news confirmed.

The public embarrassment only compacted the effect on agents, who almost universally agreed the situation was handled inappropriately.

""Nobody could have imagined that it would have been done this way,"" the former official said. ""Not a good situation.""

FBI agents are trained to separate personal feelings and politics from their work, and former officials that spoke with CNN, who are still in touch with active agents, said they had no doubt that would continue to be the case.

But while the impact may not immediately hit the mission of agents, the overall morale of the agency could continue be affected.

""I think it'll have a big morale impact,"" said another former FBI official. ""As a former agent, we were the people in the trenches for Comey, his troops, and I think it's safe to say that the general consensus is he was liked within the bureau. ... The FBI is supposed to be somewhat impenetrable or somewhat immune to the politics, but I think unfortunately this shows that that's not always the case.""

On Wednesday, the White House said that Comey had lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file, claiming that contributed to the decision to fire him.

When pressed by a reporter about praise for Comey from rank and file agents at the daily briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the claim.

""We've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things,"" she said. ""In fact the President will be meeting with acting Director (Andrew) McCabe later today to discuss that very thing, the morale of the FBI, as well as make an offer to go directly to the FBI people if necessary and appropriate.""

The White House offered no further explanation of why it was sure Comey had lost agents' confidence despite evidence to the contrary.

Who is brought in now to lead the FBI will be a key indicator of how investigations into sensitive areas like the probe into Russian meddling in the US election will proceed, the first official said.

""If it's somebody who is going to not be as independent and will listen to what Trump and Sessions want, maybe they move resources away from the investigation to the Russian activities,"" the official said. ""There's no ability within the FBI for agents to run a rogue investigation, it's just not possible.""",cnn
3,Suspect in California drink-drive crash 'deported 15 times',"Image copyright FAMILY PICTURE Image caption The boy was travelling with his parents when their car was hit

A man charged in a drink-driving crash that seriously injured a California boy had been deported to Mexico 15 times in as many years, US officials say.

Constantino Banda-Acosta, 38, drove his truck through a stop sign and hit a car carrying a family of three on their way home from a trip to Disneyland.

They said they were one block from home when the collision occurred.

The six-year-old boy suffered brain trauma and is said to be in a serious condition.

The suspect fled but was arrested.

The truck hit the rear passenger door of the car on Saturday night in the San Ysidro district of San Diego, close to the US-Mexico border, said the family.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said the suspect had been ""repatriated to Mexico at least 15 times since 2002, most recently in January 2017"".

""[ICE] has lodged a detainer against Mr Banda seeking to take him into custody if and when he is released by local authorities to pursue additional immigration enforcement action and/or criminal prosecution,"" a statement quoted by local broadcaster KGTV added.

He was charged with driving under influence, hit-and-run and driving without a licence.

Another man was also arrested in connection with the crash.

The boy is being treated at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego.

His father told CBS8 broadcaster of his son: ""Right now he's got a lot of swelling.

""He can't open one of his eyes, so he's kind of scared about why he can't see.""",bbc-news
3,Brazil's ex-President Lula questioned over corruption,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Julia Carneiro on how things changed for Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva

The former Brazilian President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has given evidence before the country's top anti-corruption judge.

He was closely questioned for five hours by Judge Sergio Moro.

Lula has rejected allegations that he received an flat as a bribe in a corruption scandal linked to the state oil company, Petrobras.

He says the trial is politically motivated and he has denied any wrongdoing.

The hearing in a courthouse in the southern city of Curitiba was closed to the public but throughout the day thousands of his supporters gathered in a square nearby.

Supporters of the investigation in to the former president gathered elsewhere in Curitiba and in the capital, Brasilia.

If Lula is found guilty he faces a prison sentence. If cleared, he has said he'll run again for the presidency.

This is the first of five charges against him.

Known throughout Brazil simply as Lula, he was Brazil's most popular president during his tenure from 2003 to 2010.

A former steel worker turned union leader, he came to office as the first left-wing leader in Brazil in nearly half a century.

Unable to stand for a third consecutive term, he was succeeded by close ally Dilma Rousseff, who was later impeached.

Why is he in court?

Lula is facing five charges related to the Car Wash scandal, the nickname for Brazil's biggest ever corruption probe.

This first case, which is being tackled in court on Wednesday, accuses Lula of taking bribes from a construction company that allegedly renovated a beachfront apartment for him.

He is also accused of money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice.

How important is this?

Lula is typically loved or hated in Brazil.

Wednesday will be the first time Lula and the powerful judge in charge of the Car Wash case, Sergio Moro, come face to face in court.

Lula says Judge Moro is politically-motivated and believes there is a witch-hunt against him.

Mr Moro is expected to hand down his verdict in 45 to 60 days.

Who is judge Sergio Moro?

Gloves off in Curitiba - By the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Brazil

Magazine covers in Brazil this week depict the face-off in epic style: one shows former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and judge Sergio Moro confronting each other in a boxing ring, raising their gloves and boasting muscular torsos in a montage. Another depicts them fiercely looking each other in the eye in superhero masks, announcing ""the first face-to-face confrontation"".

This gives a taste of the huge expectations surrounding Lula's testimony before Judge Moro.

Image copyright AFP / Getty Images Image caption Judge Sergio Moro has become a very famous figure in Brazil

Like a crowd before a boxing match, Brazilians will be split cheering on each contender.

Thousands of Lula's supporters are to rally in the city of Curitiba in his defence. Backers of the Car Wash operation will follow closely to see who has the upper hand.

But Lula won't be speaking to the judge only. He is the front-runner in next year's presidential elections, and his words will doubtless be measured to convey the right message to voters across the country.

Lula could eventually face prison or lose his political rights. But he could still become the next Brazilian president. What happens in the courtroom will help seal his fate.",bbc-news
6,James Comey doesn't quibble with Trump's right to fire him,"To all:

I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.

I have said to you before that, in times of turbulence, the American people should see the FBI as a rock of competence, honesty, and independence. What makes leaving the FBI hard is the nature and quality of its people, who together make it that rock for America.

It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing. My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.

If you do that, you too will be sad when you leave, and the American people will be safer.

Working with you has been one of the great joys of my life. Thank you for that gift.

Jeremy Lin can probably sympathize with Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones, who last week said he was taunted with racial slurs in Boston. As an Asian American in the NBA, Lin has heard his share of slurs, too.

But Lin, who plays for the Brooklyn Nets, said on the Outside Shot podcast with his teammate Randy Foye, that he heard more taunts while playing his college ball at Harvard than he hears in NBA arenas.

""The NBA crowd is a lot better than the college crowd,"" Lin said. ""The college crowd goes crazy. Some of the stuff they say, it's crazy. It's all students and they're all drunk. They were saying all kinds of stuff. I was at Georgetown and there was one dude courtside and he kept looking at me the whole game, saying 'chicken fried rice' and 'beef lo-mein' and 'beef and broccoli' ... the whole game. Then we went to Yale and they were like 'Hey, can you even see the scoreboard with those eyes?' Or, in Vermont, I remember at one point, I had my hands up with the Vermont player was shooting free throws and the coach was like, 'Hey ref you can't let that Oriental do that.'

""When I got to the NBA, I thought, 'This is going to be way worse', but it's it's way better. Everybody is more under control.""

Lin said that the worst situation during his college days came at Cornell, when he said he was called a derogatory name the entire game. He said it affected him in the first half and that he had one of his worst games. One of his teammates told his coaches what was happening, and Lin had a meeting with assistant coach Kenny Blakeney, who shared a story of his own battle with racism while playing at Duke. Lin said that meeting helped.

""That was a turning point for me in dealing with racism,"" Lin said. ""When you go through that, you have to internalize it and motivate yourself to play better. Whatever you do, you can't play out of character. You can't get your charges and make turnovers and foul out of the game. You have to find a way to turn that negative energy into something positive that motivates you. So that was the last time that I ever let racism affect me in a game. Even in the NBA, there are fans who will say small stuff and it's not a big deal. But that motivates me in a different way.""",usa-today
9,Jessica Penne flagged for potential doping violation following biological passport review | FOX Sports,"UFC strawweight Jessica Penne has been notified of a potential doping violation stemming from an out-of-competition drug test administered on March 20.

USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency) reported the findings to the UFC on Wednesday.

Penne’s situation is unique because she was tested on March 20 yet went onto fight on April 22 where she lost a decision to Danielle Taylor at UFC Fight Night in Nashville.

The reason for the delay stems from the original testing done on Penne’s sample showed no traces of any banned substances. However, USADA reviewed Penn’s biological passport and due to certain markers the sample was re-tested and a prohibited substance was detected.

A biological passport is a tool WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) defines as a way “to monitor selected biological variables over time that indirectly reveal the effects of doping rather than attempting to detect the doping substance or method itself”. In other words, the passport monitors an athlete’s levels over time for a potential doping violations that may appear outside of the standard drug testing procedures.

Unfortunately the additional testing wasn’t returned ahead of Penne’s fight on April 22.

Penne is afforded an adjudication process that will be handled by USADA and the anti-doping organization will also work with the Tennessee Athletic Commission on the matter as they were overseeing the event in Nashville.

As of now, Penne has been placed on a provisional suspension as she awaits her adjudication process with USADA.",fox-sports
3,Michael Flynn: Documents sought from ex-Trump advisor over Russia inquiry,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Not all Republicans are happy with the Comey firing

A US Senate panel investigating Russian interference in last year's election has issued a formal demand for documents from President Donald Trump's former national security adviser.

Michael Flynn has failed to voluntarily co-operate with the investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee says.

He was forced to resign in February after failing to disclose the content of his talks with Russian diplomats.

Meanwhile, the fallout continues over the firing of the FBI director.

The White House maintained that James Comey was removed on Tuesday for his handling of the inquiry over Hillary Clinton's emails.

But US media reported that he had recently asked the Justice Department for more resources for his Trump-Russia investigation.

Flynn: Documents demanded

The Senate Intelligence Committee said it issued a subpoena after Mr Flynn rejected its request on 28 April to submit documents relevant to the investigation.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Flynn was forced to resign in February

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

The rare use of a subpoena by senators makes it clear that the committee is forging ahead with its investigation into the alleged Trump-Russia links, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington says.

Reaction to Mr Comey's firing continued on Wednesday, with a White House spokeswoman saying that President Trump had been considering sacking the FBI director since he was elected.

But critics accuse the Republican president of firing the nation's top law enforcement official because he was leading the Russian inquiry.

Blumenthal has been critical of Trump's decision to fire Comey

Washington (CNN) Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday that President Donald Trump's decision to fire his FBI director could lead to possible impeachment proceedings in Congress.

""It may well produce another United States vs. Nixon on a subpoena that went to United States Supreme Court,"" the Connecticut Democrat said on ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""It may well produce impeachment proceedings, although we're very far from that possibility.""

Blumenthal has been quick to criticize the President in wake of the firing. On CNN's ""New Day,"" Wednesday, he called Trump's decision ""a looming constitutional crisis.""

In response, Trump went after Blumenthal on Twitter.

Benavidez initially announced the news via his Twitter account on Wednesday.

Sad to share that I suffered an injury, will not be fighting June 10th. I'll focus on what I can do and be back. Thank you for the support. — Joseph Benavidez (@JoeJitsu) May 10, 2017

Benavidez is expected to have surgery on his injured knee next week.

Recovery from a torn ACL can take several months or even up to a year or more depending on the time needed for recovery and rehabilitation.

Benavidez isn’t alone as numerous UFC fighters have suffered through the same injury in recent years including Georges St-Pierre having torn ACL’s in both of his knees as well as Conor McGregor, Dominick Cruz and many more.

To all:

I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.

I have said to you before that, in times of turbulence, the American people should see the FBI as a rock of competence, honesty, and independence. What makes leaving the FBI hard is the nature and quality of its people, who together make it that rock for America.

It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing. My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.

(Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)

WASHINGTON — Marc-Andre Fleury’s 29-save shutout sparked the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 2-0 win against the Washington Capitals to earn a spot in the Eastern Conference final.

What it means: The Penguins’ quest to be the first Stanley Cup champion to repeat since the Detroit Red Wings did it in 1997 and 1998 is still alive. They now meet the Ottawa Senators in a best-of-seven series, starting on Saturday in Pittsburgh.

Turning point in Game 7: The opening minutes of the game when the Capitals unleashed unwavering offensive pressure. But Fleury and his defense weathered the storm until the Penguins could rediscover their confidence.

Based on how the Capitals dominated the third period of Game 5, and all of Game 6, they might have carried that momentum throughout Game 7 had they been able to push a puck past Fleury in those opening moments.

""We came out like a house on fire (in the opening two minutes) and it sure would have been nice to pop one,” Washington Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen said.

""I think we got through that first little wave there and got to our game and we were much more on our toes,"" Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said. ""I thought we still went at them.. I thought we really played the right way with the lead.""

Penguins’ No. 1 star: Fleury played with considerable gusto and confidence. He made a key save against Alex Ovechkin with the score 1-0. Given his eight wins in this postseason, it’s now hard to remember that Fleury was scheduled to be the Pittsburgh backup in the playoffs until Matt Murray was injured in the warm-up of Game 1. By the way, Murray finally came off the injured list to be Fleury’s backup in Game 7.

Game-winning goal: Bryan Rust buried a shot high into the net from the slot after being set up by a perfect feed from Jake Guentzel. Crosby drew the secondary assist. Last season, en route to the Stanley Cup, the Penguins won a Game 7 against the Tampa Bay Lightning by a 2-1 verdict. Rust scored both of Pittsburgh’s goals in that Game 7.

Ovechkin mistake: Ovechkin’s failure to clear the puck out of his zone led to Patric Hornqvist scoring Pittsburgh’s second goal, on a backhander, at 4:14 of the third period. Ovechkin’s playoff agony continues.

Not Braden Holtby’s fault: The Capitals goalie also played a strong game, keeping Washington within striking distance with big saves in the third period.

Streak continues: The Penguins have never lost a Game 7 on the road. They are now 6-0 in franchise history. They are 4-0 against Washington in Game 7s.

Streak broken: Washington winger Justin Williams has been called Mr. Game 7 because he was 7-0 in Game 7s. He is now 7-1.

What it means for the Capitals: They haven’t reached the conference final since 1998, and this group might not be the same next season. T.J. Oshie, Williams, Kevin Shattenkirk and Karl Alzner are among the potential unrestricted free agents. The Capitals are 4-11 in Game 7s in franchise history. They were also eliminated from the playoffs by the Penguins last season.

“It’s just extreme disappointment,” Alzner said. “There are times when you know you are not the best team in the playoffs, or playing the best. But we honestly thought we were the best team in the playoffs and showed flashes of it.”",usa-today

Lavrov arrives at the West Wing at a dramatic moment in American politics -- hours after Trump fired FBI director James Comey because ""he wasn't doing a good job"". Video provided by AFP Newslook

This handout photo released by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, shows President Trump meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the Oval Office of the White House on May 10, 2017. ORG XMIT: (Photo: Russian Foreign Ministry via AP)

At a time of strain between the White House and the media over coverage of the new administration, reporters raised questions Wednesday as to why a photographer from the Russian media, but not the U.S. press, was apparently allowed into an Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Russian officials.

The issue surfaced after photos of the meeting, including Trump shaking hands with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and controversial Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, appeared in the Russian media.

The images were taken by a photographer from TASS, the Russian state-owned new agency.

The issue was further inflamed by the presence of Kislyak, who has been at the center of several controversies involving administration officials, including now fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Russian embassy even tweeted a photograph of Trump smiling broadly as he put his arm around the diplomat while shaking his hand in the Oval Office.

Flynn was fired in February for lying to Vice President Mike Pence by denying that he had discussed the issue of U.S. sanctions with Kislyak. Sessions recused himself from any investigations involving the Trump administration and Russia after acknowledging that he had failed to tell senators during his confirmation hearing that he had met previously with he diplomat.

In addition, Kislyak was brought into the Trump Tower in New York in December out of the sight of reporters for a meeting with Flynn and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and now senior advisor, according to The New York Times.

The photos were taken by TASS photographer Alexander Shcherbak and credited to him by the agency, which included a copyright symbol in photo captions in its own news reports of the meeting. The photos were also distributed by the Associated Press, which credits the Russian Foreign Ministry as the source, and Getty Images, which credits TASS.

After the photos began circulating, members of the White House press corps inquired whether the Russian media had been allowed into the closed meetings.

The White House responded, according to a White House pool report, by saying, ""On background, our official photographer and their official photographer were present, that's it.""

Talking Points Memosays TASS Washington bureau chief, Andrei Sitov, told TPM initially that no one from his Washington bureau was present at the meeting, but later revised his comments.

“Apparently the TASS person was admitted at the request of the Russian Foreign Ministry as the official photographer for the Russian side,” Sitov told TPM in a later email. “He is permanently assigned to cover FM Lavrov. His pictures from the meeting are available at the Russian FM’s Flickr. I was not even aware of this.”

Frequently the White House press pool is allowed in the room at the start of an official meetings to take photograph and, if possible, to ask the participants questions.

In addition to the photos, TASS provided comments by Lavrov on the Oval Office meeting with Trump, which had followed bilateral talks between him and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

Lavrov told TASS that in the meeting with Trump, ""(we) discussed, first and foremost, our cooperation on the international stage.""

""At present, our dialogue is not as politicized as it used to be during Obama’s presidency,"" Lavrov said. ""The Trump administration, including the president himself and the secretary of state, are people of action who are willing to negotiate.""

MONTPELIER, Vt. — Vermont’s Legislature become the first in the nation Wednesday to approve a recreational marijuana legalization bill.

Vermont's bill, which would legalize small amounts of marijuana possession in 2018 and anticipate the possibility of a taxed and regulated legal marijuana market, was approved in the Vermont House of Representatives on Wednesday afternoon by a vote of 79-66. The state Senate already passed the bill, so it will go directly to GOP Gov. Phil Scott.

Eight states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington — and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana following a voter referendum, but no state yet has legalized marijuana solely through the legislative process, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Legalization advocates said bills were pending in other state legislatures.

""I think it reflects that Vermont elected officials are more in touch with our constituents than a lot of elected officials in other states,"" said Vermont Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman, a member of the Vermont Progressive Party who has worked on marijuana issues for the majority of his political career. ""I think the public is ahead of us, but elected officials tend to be cautious when it comes to change.""

► April 13: Canada announces legislation to legalize marijuana

Wednesday's vote closed a debate over legalization, particularly in the state House. The divisiveness once prompted Senate President Pro Tempore Tim Ashe, a Democrat from Burlington, Vt., to predict that legalization would take a miracle to pass this year.

Advocates hugged and shared high-fives outside the two chambers after the vote.

“Vermont elected officials are more in touch with our constituents than a lot of elected officials in other states.” Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman, Vermont

Earlier in the day, the House Judiciary Committee voted 8-3 to support the limited bill, which was pitched as a compromise between the House and Senate approaches on marijuana.

The proposal incorporates H.170, a House-supported bill that would legalize possession of up to one ounce of marijuana, two mature marijuana plants or four immature marijuana plants for adults older than 21. The effective date was pushed to July 1, 2018.

The bill also sets up a nine-member commission to study the best way to regulate marijuana.

""There's no slam dunk of any kind,"" Rep. Barbara Rachelson, a Burlington Democrat, said about the prospect of a legal marijuana market. ""It just is doing work that could be used next year or in subsequent years.""

The proposal would continue to prohibit driving under the influence of marijuana and the use of marijuana in public places. Employers, landlords, schools and prisons could continue to restrict marijuana use.

""The data indicates that our youth are using marijuana more infrequently, and I don't think we should put that in jeopardy,"" said GOP Rep. Scott Beck of St. Johnsbury, Vt., who voted against the bill.

► March 17: World's first marijuana gym is in (where else?) California

Democratic Rep. Susan Buckholz of Hartford, Vt., said declining marijuana use among the state's high school students, measured at 37% in the latest Vermont Youth Risk Behavior Survey, shows that anti-drug education is working.

“We need to make a move to be treating this as a public health issue for those for whom it is a health issue and letting other people use this substance responsibly,” Buckholz said.

If Scott signs the bill, a new commission would be responsible for drafting a system to tax and regulate marijuana and submitting the plan to the Legislature. The end result would need to be a marijuana regulatory system that ""increases public safety and reduces harm to public health.""

""The administration will be at the table, along with the attorney general and others,"" said Democratic Rep. Maxine Grad of Moretown, Vt., chairwoman of the House Judiciary Committee. ""With Massachusetts and Maine starting up in 2018, I think we need to continue this conversation.""

Scott repeatedly has expressed concerns about marijuana and highway safety. He has the choice to sign the bill, veto the bill, or allow it to become law without his signature.

The first-term Republican governor declined to say before Wednesday's House vote whether he would veto the legislation.

""I don't believe this is a priority for Vermont,"" Scott said. ""I believe that what we should be doing is trying to find ways to protect those on our highways, deliver a level of impairment that is consistent throughout the Northeast, as well as to address the edibles for our kids before we move forward with legalization. Having said that, I'm going to review the bill as it's passed.""

3,Michael Flynn: Documents sought from ex-Trump adviser over Russia inquiry,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Not all Republicans are happy with the Comey firing

A US Senate panel investigating Russian interference in last year's election has issued a formal demand for documents from President Donald Trump's former national security adviser.

Michael Flynn has failed to voluntarily co-operate with the investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee says.

He was forced to resign in February after failing to disclose the content of his talks with Russian diplomats.

Meanwhile, the fallout continues over the firing of the FBI director.

The White House maintained that James Comey was removed on Tuesday for his handling of the inquiry over Hillary Clinton's emails.

But US media reported that he had recently asked the Justice Department for more resources for his Trump-Russia investigation.

Flynn: Documents demanded

The Senate Intelligence Committee said it issued a subpoena after Mr Flynn rejected its request on 28 April to submit documents relevant to the investigation.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Flynn was forced to resign in February

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

The rare use of a subpoena by senators makes it clear that the committee is forging ahead with its investigation into the alleged Trump-Russia links, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington says.

Comey fired: Fallout continues

Reaction to Mr Comey's firing continued on Wednesday, with a White House spokeswoman saying that President Trump had been considering sacking the FBI director since he was elected.

But critics accuse the Republican president of firing the nation's top law enforcement official because he was leading the Russian inquiry.

The White House has rejected calls to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate allegations the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin over last year's election.

The Senate Intelligence Committee invited Mr Comey to testify next week.

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed"".

""It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing,"" he added.

9,"Dana White scraps plans for Georges St-Pierre vs. Michael Bisping, declares Yoel Romero will get next title shot | FOX Sports","Georges St-Pierre may be coming back to the UFC, but it appears he’s no longer going to face Michael Bisping in his return to the Octagon.

After several delays to the proposed matchup between St-Pierre and Bisping, UFC president Dana White has decided to take the fight off the table and instead give the next title shot to No. 1 ranked middleweight contender Yoel Romero.

White’s frustration over the situation stems from St-Pierre just recently releasing a message where he invited Bisping to pick a date for their fight after October when the matchup was originally supposed to take place in July.

White finally said enough is enough and he’s pushing forward with a new fight between Bisping and Romero later this year.

“I made this GSP fight, we did a press conference. The thing was supposed to happen in July. Michael Bisping is going to have to defend his title now. We’re not waiting for GSP,” White told FOX Sports Australia’s “UFC Fight Week”.

“(Yoel) doesn’t need to voice his opinion on why he needs a title shot. He definitely deserves a title shot. He’s next in line, he’s the No.1 ranked guy in the world.”

The shocking turn of events comes on the heels of numerous contenders at middleweight complaining about St-Pierre getting a shot at the title while Bisping would be sitting out for over a year without defending the belt. St-Pierre is returning to the UFC for the first time in nearly four years but has never competed at middleweight during his career.

Romero was declared the No. 1 contender following his stunning knockout win over former champion Chris Weidman last November, but he stepped aside when the UFC decided to matchup Bisping with St-Pierre.

Now it appears the former Olympic silver medalist will get his shot after all and from the sound of things the bout with Bisping will come together sooner rather than later.

“Georges St-Pierre was coming back. Bisping-St-Pierre — they both wanted that fight. We asked Yoel to step aside, he did. It doesn’t look like that fight is gonna happen now. Georges St-Pierre is saying he will not be ready to compete now until November. Who knows if that’s even the case. It could be next year,” White lamented.

“So we’re not waiting for Georges St-Pierre anymore. We’re moving on with the division, and Yoel Romero will get the next shot.”",fox-sports
6,24 hours of craziness in Trump's Washington,"Even by the often bewildering standards of the Trump administration, the 24 hours following the firing of FBI Director James Comey were baffling, surreal and at times impossible to process.

In the confusing hours when up seemed down and down seemed up, the White House appeared to be defending Hillary Clinton, the FBI chief was among the last to know he was gone, and there was a cameo performance by Russian President Vladimir Putin in his ice skates.

It all started with a bolt from nowhere late Tuesday afternoon. President Donald Trump canned Comey. No one had thought it would come to this, since the FBI director was overseeing an investigation into Russian election meddling and alleged collusion by Trump campaign aides with Moscow. But the President, either dismissive or oblivious to the political damage he could suffer, did it anyway.

But it was the reason that Trump pulled the trapdoor under Comey that made it so difficult to believe. The White House cited a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein upbraiding Comey over his handling of the Clinton email saga.

So Trump went from touring the country calling for the former secretary of state to be thrown in jail to using Comey's treatment of her as a reason to oust him. No wonder Democrats said it didn't pass the smell test.

The looming dismissal of Comey was held close to the vest in the White House -- a factor that later complicated efforts to explain it to the press.

And Comey himself was among the last to know. He was talking to FBI recruits when he learned the cruel plot twist that had claimed his job -- in where else but Hollywood, California -- when someone glanced at the TV tuned to cable news that was at that moment breaking the news of his firing. Comey thought it was a joke sources said, but he called his office to find out the truth.

Back in Washington, things got stranger still. Amazingly for someone who made his name on reality television telling people ""You're fired!"" to their faces, the President is a bit squeamish about swinging the ax in person. So he sent a top aide to deliver Comey's pink slip, presented in a manila folder to the FBI headquarters a few blocks from the White House.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook captured the Washington mood, tweeting: ""Twilight zone.""

CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin was incredulous. ""This is not normal,"" he said.

A little later on, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey laid claim to the ""first person to use the Nixon metaphor"" award.

Ironically enough, just about the only people whose hair wasn't on fire were in the press office of the White House. There was a news volcano erupting in Washington, but press aide Lindsey Waters said there will be no further comment Tuesday night.

Meanwhile, in Yorba Linda, California, resentment was brewing. Then, in a epic tweet, the Nixon Library staff sprang to their namesake's defense: ""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian.""

While the 37th president's honor was being restored, it was dawning on the White House -- several hours later than for everyone else in Washington -- that there was a problem. One source amazingly told CNN's Dana Bash that the press shop didn't believe that firing Comey would cause such a backlash. After all, Democrats were as mad at him as Republicans, weren't they?

Up on Capitol Hill, lawmakers were forced to make quick calculations about how to respond to Trump's stunning gambit before they were mobbed by prowling reporters.

Washington was so shook up that even pals like Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain weren't on the same page. Graham backed the firing; McCain was troubled by what transpired.

It was all hands to the pumps on the North lawn of the White House. Trump aides fanned out to spin the press. Kellyanne Conway made it on air on CNN with Anderson Cooper, who registered disbelief when she managed to squeeze in a plug for her boss's election triumph in Michigan. ""Late Late Show"" host James Corden later tweeted at the disbelieving newsman: ""Best. EyeRoll. Ever.""

Then, it was time for Comey to come home.

But to do so, the towering and now former, law enforcement supremo had to get to the airport. The sight of his SUV making its way down a California highway with a chasing helicopter beaming live pictures to cable TV added another layer of headscratching scenery.

Back in Washington, Trump's brain trust was trying to play catch up. In the most bizarre of circumstances, White House spokesman Sean Spicer conducted one the most unorthodox gaggles of his career, in the dark at night, dwarfed by a large shrub at the side of the White House North lawn.

For a while, there was time to sleep.

But at 6:27 am ET, there came a Twitter wake-up call. ""When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"" Trump wrote on his favorite social media platform.

But things weren't calming down. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was in town for the best show on Earth, and had some fun over Comey's plight at America's expense. ""Was he fired? You're kidding!"" he deadpanned at the tail end of a photo-op at the State Department.

Down Pennsylvania Avenue, someone was missing from his post. Was it a case of man overboard? No, Spicer hadn't jumped ship, though he could be forgiven from absconding from the press grilling that awaited. He was just doing naval reserve duties at the Pentagon. But his curious timing quickly fanned rumors about whether he was next in line for a Trump takedown.

Before long, there was even more love for the Trump administration from Russia.

In the most surreal moment yet, the Russian embassy tweeted a photo of its ambassador -- and reputed master spy -- Sergey Kislyak, in a grip and grin with the President, who by now had already hosted Lavrov in the Oval Office. Kislyak's interactions with top Trump world associates -- including the attorney general and Trump's own son-in-law before they landed their administration jobs -- have spawned a steady stream of questions now being examined by multiple congressional committees. So the President's appearance with him seemed to either be a case of defiance towards the Beltway crowd, or a misreading of the political damage he risked.

It turned out to be a day for curious photo ops.

Who should be next for the Oval Office treatment but Nixon's former secretary of state Henry Kissinger? The nonagenarian foreign policy expert was pictured seated side-by-side with Trump -- in practically the same spot where he counseled his own scandal tainted boss as the Watergate crisis raged over 40 years ago.

With Spicer away, his deputy Sarah Huckabee Sanders was pressganged into service. Perhaps seeking to stave off the interrogation as long as possible she wished her daughter Scarlett a happy birthday before wading into the fray.

While chaos reined in Washington, there was one more jab from Moscow.

CBS News managed to catch up with Russian President Vladimir Putin at his ice hockey game. ""We have nothing to do with"" the Comey drama, the Russian president confided. But his smile thickened the mystery.

By the end of the day, Washington was just trying to catch a breath, but not before McCain had adjudged the Comey-gate affair as worthy of a spot on the long list of Washington scandals. ""There's more shoes to drop,"" he warned ominously.

But the day had one more touch of farce to come. It emerged that that actor, singer and wrestler known as ""The Rock"" was giving thought to running for president.

""I think that it's a real possibility,"" he told GQ, but almost no one noticed because the prospect of President The Rock was only about the 25th most surreal political thing that had happened of the previous 24 hours.",cnn

WASHINGTON — The disappointment etched into Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin’s face looked as if it could leave scars.

After another unexpected playoff exit by the Capitals, Ovechkin’s line read: no points, minus-2 and a major defensive mistake on Pittsburgh’s second goal in a 2-0 loss to the Penguins.

“I don’t think our urgency was there,” Ovechkin said.

Ovechkin has been with the Capitals since 2005 and he’s never been beyond the second round of the playoffs

He had two goals and three assists in the first six games, but he played arguably his worst game of the series in Game 7.

“Obviously, (the team had) plenty chances to score … make a couple mistakes and it cost us,” Ovechkin said.

His failure to clear the puck out of his zone led directly to a goal by Patric Hornqvist that gave the Penguins a 2-0 lead

MORE:

Ovechkin was minus-5 in the series, and never had a plus game. Washington coach Barry Trotz played Ovechkin 18:22 in Game 7. Six other Washington forwards played more than him.

Trotz said Ovechkin's playing time was close to everyone else's minutes. ""He doesn't kill penalties. That's why. Then you have pop-up lines and what have you. Most of our top guys were in that 18-20 range.""

Ovechkin had been moved to the third line with the idea of getting more production from the bottom six forwards.

""We're trying,"" Ovechkin said. ""We try to do our best.""

Added Washington winger T.J. Oshie: “I think (Ovechkin) had a great postseason. I think last year he had a phenomenal postseason as well. Teams win this time of year. I think Ovi did a great job leading us and I think he did a good job of scoring us goals and bringing us offense, bringing us those big hits. You need all 20 guys to win at this time of year and when guys aren’t playing great the other guys got to pick him up. Someone’s got to carry the torch and tonight we didn’t have that.""",usa-today

HOUSTON – When the Houston Rockets take on the San Antonio Spurs in Game 6 of the Western Conference Semifinals on Thursday at the Toyota Center, the man who built their groundbreaking roster will be nowhere to be found.

Daryl Morey, the 44-year-old general manager whose Rockets trail 3-2 in the series, will be watching on television in an undisclosed location in the back.

“I can’t watch in the bowl,” Morey told USA TODAY Sports during a behind-the-scenes visit with the Rockets between Games 2 and 3. “Not for big games, I’m not in the bowl. I can’t do it. I’m a disaster. I would be the worst coach in history, because I’d be screaming and yelling and I’d get 40 techs. I’m usually by myself (in the back).”

The NBA playoffs are a nerve-wracking time for all involved, with legacies on the line and much more in the balance. But it may be worse for front office executives like Morey, if only because they’re rendered so helpless this time of year.

The coaches get to coach. The players have to play. And Morey, who surrounded James Harden with all those shooters and saw it pay off in the form of a surprising 55-win regular season, is left to his own devices. Literally.

“I went to sleep at 4 last night,” Morey said with a self-effacing chuckle. “Some of it is just nervous energy. You’re re-watching the game and trying to figure out what San Antonio (is doing). They’re…arguably the best coached team ever, so I’m always trying to figure out what they’re going to do next, if I can come up with anything. Luckily, we have a great coaching staff (because) I don’t think of (expletive) that they don’t think of.

“Every possession matters in the playoffs, so if there’s something – and one great strength from (Rockets coach) Mike (D’Antoni) is he takes input from everyone, all the way down to the intern. So if there’s a good idea that comes up, he’s going to use it. He’s not going to care where it comes from.”

Latest NBA playoff coverage:

No matter what happens next, this season has been a renaissance for Morey just as it has been for D’Antoni and Harden. They all faced scrutiny of some sort as recently as last summer, D’Antoni as a coach whose best days were behind him, Harden as a star with limitations who was roundly blamed for the Rockets’ regression. They went from the Western Conference finals in 2015 to a first-round exit less than a year later. But Morey was the one whose very ethos was being questioned – again.

It’s been that way since 2006, when Rockets owner Les Alexander hired a headhunter to find his next general manager and wound up taking a chance on a 33-year-old from the Boston Celtics who had worked his way into the NBA through a consulting firm. Morey, a Northwestern grad who received his MBA from MIT and has long since become the de facto leader of the NBA’s analytics movement, had spent his previous three years as senior vice president of operations and information with the Boston Celtics.

“When I hired Daryl, everybody said, ‘What are you doing hiring an analytic guy?” the 73-year-old Alexander told USA TODAY Sports while seated in his office. “They all thought I was crazy. (Then-general manager Carroll Dawson) was retiring, and (the headhunter) said, ‘Well I have this young guy from the Celtics. He’s a little different. You should interview him.’ So I interviewed him, and – if you talk to anybody, I really like smart people. I fall in love with smart people. Everybody here is smart. If they’re not smart, they don’t last. So he came in, and he was really smart, and I loved the analytical part. I wanted some edge. Everybody can do the same thing, and I wanted an edge. And so I hired him.”

But in all of Morey’s time in Houston, from the end of the Jeff Van Gundy era through the Rick Adelman years and the Kevin McHale tenure that he brought to an end with his firing early last season, we’ve never seen synergy like this between his front office and the coaching staff. Their shared philosophy of taking only three-pointers and layups, once considered so extreme back when D’Antoni was leaning this way with his Seven-Seconds-or-Less Phoenix Suns, is becoming more of a league-wide norm. And with their core of Harden, Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza, Ryan Anderson, Clint Capela, and Lou Williams all under contract at least through next season, there’s surely more to come.

It’s enough to make Alexander grin.

“For the last 20 years, I’ve been saying we should play fast, take threes,” Alexander said. “And when things changed last year (with McHale being fired and J.B. Bickerstaff taking over as interim coach five games in), I badly wanted the coach we have now.

“Everybody in town wanted me to hire a young guy. So I was going to ruin James’ career until the young guy learned how to coach? Anything you do, you’re not as good the first day as you are 10 years later. You can’t be. So I didn’t want a guy to learn with James, I thought that was ridiculous. And I loved the way Mike played. And when we met him, he was a great personality, a great fit. “

A decade after finding Morey, Alexander had found an edge – again.

A US Senate panel investigating Russian interference in last year's election has issued a rare formal demand for documents from President Donald Trump's former national security adviser.

Michael Flynn has failed to voluntarily co-operate with the investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee says.

He was forced to resign in February after failing to disclose the content of his talks with Russian diplomats.

Meanwhile, the fallout continues over the firing of the FBI director.

The White House maintained that James Comey was removed on Tuesday for his handling of the inquiry over Hillary Clinton's emails.

But senior Democrats said he had recently asked the Justice Department for more resources for his Trump-Russia investigation.

Flynn: Documents demanded

The Senate Intelligence Committee said it issued a subpoena after Mr Flynn rejected its request on 28 April to submit documents relevant to the investigation.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

The rare use of a subpoena by senators makes it clear that the committee is forging ahead with its investigation into the alleged Trump-Russia links, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington says.

Reaction to Mr Comey's firing continued on Wednesday, with a White House spokeswoman saying that President Trump had been considering sacking the FBI director since he was elected.

The White House has rejected calls to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate allegations the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin over last year's election.

The Senate Intelligence Committee invited Mr Comey to testify next week.

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed"".

""I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all,"" he wrote.

""It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing,"" he added.

9,Defending champion Penguins find Stanley Cup form against Capitals in Game 7,"Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury (29) and center Sidney Crosby (87) celebrate after defeating the Washington Capitals 2-0 in Game 7. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)

WASHINGTON — For the last period of Game 5, all of Game 6, and the opening two minutes of Game 7, the Pittsburgh Penguins looked like a group of players that had forgotten how they won the Stanley Cup 11 months ago.

Then in the fourth and fifth minute of Game 7, the memory of how to succeed all came back to them.

“That might be the best game that we’ve played in the playoffs to this point,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said after the Penguins downed the Washington Capitals 2-0 in Game 7. “I thought that was the closest thing to the Penguins’ identity that we’ve seen in the playoffs so far.”

After being dominated by the Capitals for four periods in two losses that tied the best-of-seven series 3-3, the Penguins rediscovered the level of composure and efficiency they commanded in last year’s run to the Stanley Cup.

“Obviously a lot of people counted us out after last game, and I can understand it,” Penguins center Matt Cullen said. “We didn't have a good game and they ran all over us. It was a credit to the character in the room to respond the way we did and come out and throw together a good game.""

It was actually an exceptional game. After surviving the Capitals storming of the castle in the opening minutes, the Penguins did a much better job moving the puck out of their zone.

In the third period, when the Capitals were looking to mount a full charge, the Penguins limited Washington to six shots on goal.

MORE:

While all of this was going on, Marc-Andre Fleury, the goalie that likely will be traded this summer, played brilliantly in net, making 29 saves, for his first shutout of the postseason.

“He’s been our best player the whole playoffs,” said Penguins forward Patric Hornqvist, who scored one of Pittsburgh’s goals.

Cullen said Fleury “stole” multiple games in this series. “And kept us in a lot of others,” Cullen said. “We give him a lot of credit. You can’t ask for a better teammate.”

What makes the Game 7 triumph against Washington more impressive is that the Penguins have been undermined by injuries throughout the postseason.

They are still without No. 1 defenseman Kris Letang, and key puck-moving defenseman Trevor Daley was out for Game 7. In this series, they played one game without Sidney Crosby and 23-goal scorer Conor Sheary.

Fleury is only playing because Matt Murray was injured an hour before the playoffs began. He’s healthy now, but good luck getting the job back from Fleury, who has a .927 save percentage in this postseason.

The Capitals were the No. 1 regular-season team. Now, one of the Penguins’ challenges would be to guard against over-confidence. But it seems like this team is too experienced to do that.

The Penguins know they hadn’t played as impressively as they did last season when they won the Stanley Cup. That’s on their mind as they continue their quest to become the first team in the salary cap era to win back-to-back titles.

As a group we know there's another gear,” Cullen said. “And I think we're all just really happy we get a chance to find it in this next series.""",usa-today
6,The White House's explanation for the firing of James Comey is totally unraveling,"(CNN) The White House just can't get its story straight about why President Trump decided to fire FBI Director James Comey.

When the move was initially announced -- just before 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday night -- the White House pointed to a memo written by deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that made the case that Comey had lost support of the organization with his handling of the investigation into the private email server maintained by Hillary Clinton.

""I cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken,"" wrote Rosenstein. ""Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.""

From the jump, it seemed odd that Comey's actions in and around the Clinton email server investigation were the impetus for this move. After all, while Trump had been openly critical of the Director's decision not to bring charges against Clinton, he had also heaped praise on Comey when the investigation was re-opened in late October due to the discovery of another trove of emails.

""It took guts for director Comey to make the move that he made,"" Trump said of Comey's decision at an Oct. 31 rally . ""It took a lot of guts.""

Later, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the real reason for Comey's dismissal was the ""atrocities"" he had committed against the chain of command by openly acknowledging in Congressional testimony last week that he had not told the attorney general -- Loretta Lynch at the time -- what he would say on July 5 when he announced his findings in the Clinton case.

JUST WATCHED White House: Comey had missteps and mistakes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White House: Comey had missteps and mistakes 00:51

So, which is it? And did Trump, who huddled with Rosenstein on Monday, ask the deputy attorney general to write a memo to justify the firing? Or did Rosenstein do it of his own accord without Trump's knowledge? (There are conflicting reports on that coming out of the White House.) And did Trump turn on Comey relatively recently -- maybe starting with his testimony to Congress on May 3 -- or had he been considering getting rid of Comey from the first day of his presidency as Huckabee Sanders said? (There are conflicting reports on that too.)

What the ever-changing stories trying to explain why Trump did what he did suggest is that no one either knows or wants to talk about the real reason that Trump moved on Comey.

And that reason appears to be, according to scads of reporting in CNN and elsewhere, that Trump was angry at Comey -- for not being enough of a company man, for seemingly undercutting his 2016 victory, for dismissing the ideas that President Obama had surveilled him in the campaign, for continuing to push on the Russia investigation when Trump wanted him to spend more time on the number of leaks coming out of the intelligence agencies.

""Several people familiar with the decision say the President grew increasingly frustrated at Comey after his congressional hearing last Wednesday when he testified that he was 'mildly nauseous' over the idea that he helped sway the election.""

JUST WATCHED Comey: 'Nauseous' over election thoughts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Comey: 'Nauseous' over election thoughts 01:57

Trump, we know, spends a lot of time talking about and thinking about his 2016 election victory. And nothing makes him angrier than when he believes someone is trying to either lessen or take credit for what he accomplished in that race. That, in Trump's mind, is the one unforgivable sin.

The firing of an FBI director is always going to be a big deal that merits explanation. That the White House has offered so many -- and they all appear to be either contradictory, half true or misinformed -- makes this an even bigger deal.

The President regularly takes to social media to attack political opponents

(CNN) President Donald Trump acknowledged in a new interview that the combative nature of his administration could be his fault -- though he also cites ""a great meanness"" in society that's to blame.

""It could be my fault,"" Trump told Time magazine when asked directly if he feels his administration has been too combative. ""I don't want to necessarily blame, but there's a great meanness out there that I'm surprised at.""

Trump did not further elaborate. His administration has notably had a tense and antagonistic relationship with the news media -- going so far at one point to bar journalists from a White House briefing -- and his tenure in office has often been the subject of massive protests across the nation.

The Trump administration has also been marked by internal squabbling.

Trump grew so frustrated last month with the clear tensions between his chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior adviser Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, that he insisted they work out their differences.

6,White House furious after being trolled with Russia Oval Office photos,"Story highlights The White House did not post photos of the meeting

The Russians used the photos to troll the White House in its social media posts Wednesday

Washington (CNN) The White House did not anticipate that the Russian government would allow its state news agency to post photographs of an Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russia's ambassador to the US, a White House official said.

Photos of Wednesday's meeting, taken by a Russian state news media photographer one day after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey amid questions about possible Trump campaign collusion with Moscow, were ultimately posted by Russia's news agency, TASS.

The White House did not post photos of the meeting although an official White House photographer was also in the room, the White House said. The State Department did post photos of Lavrov's meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, but that was open to the press.

Smith sought to moderate her comments with a follow up tweet

Washington (CNN) A US ambassador has taken the rare step of expressing frustration with the Trump administration for complicating American diplomats' work overseas.

On Wednesday morning local time, soon after FBI Director James Comey was fired, Dana Shell Smith, envoy to Qatar, tweeted: ""Increasingly difficult to wake up overseas to news from home, knowing I will spend today explaining our democracy and institutions.""

The exact target of her comment was unclear, but it was widely interpreted as criticizing President Donald Trump for dismissing Comey.

Smith sought to moderate her comments with a follow up tweet Thursday, writing, ""diplomats explain & defend our political system. Can be tough when partisan acrimony so high, but there is still no greater country.""

3,Triple talaq: India top court reviews Islamic instant divorce,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shavista Sheikh: 'These words destroy people's lives'

India's Supreme Court has formally opened hearings into a number of petitions challenging the controversial practice of instant divorce in Islam.

The court said it would examine whether the practice known as ""triple talaq"" was fundamental to the religion.

India is one of a handful of countries in the world where a Muslim man can divorce his wife in minutes by saying the word talaq (divorce) three times.

But activists say the practice is ""discriminatory"".

Many Muslim groups have opposed the court's intervention in their religious matters, although the move has the backing of the current Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The sensitive issue is being heard by a multi-faith bench made up of five judges - a Hindu, a Sikh, a Christian, a Zoroastrian and one Muslim.

The bench has combined several petitions from Muslim women and rights groups into one to examine the issue.

The opposing sides have been given three days each to argue their cases, with the court saying the hearing will end by 19 May.

A judgement is expected to be delivered in the coming weeks.

Analysis: Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi

The Indian government has told the court that triple talaq is unconstitutional, against gender justice and the dignity of women.

Muslim organisations that support the practice say it's an issue of faith and personal law, and the courts have no role in reviewing it.

For years now, Muslim women in India have been demanding a ban on a practice they view as reprehensible.

Campaigners say over the years, thousands of women, especially those from poor families, have been discarded by their husbands, many have been rendered destitute with nowhere to go and many have been forced to return to their parental homes or fend for themselves.

Muslims are India's largest minority community with a population of 155 million and their marriages and divorces are governed by the Muslim personal law, ostensibly based on Sharia, or Islamic law.

The law came into force in 1937 and lays out that, in matters of personal dispute, the state shall not interfere.

'Our lives are ruined'

Image caption Shayara Bano has petitioned the Supreme Court to declare triple talaq unconstitutional

Shayara Bano, one of the petitioners challenging the controversial triple talaq, spoke to the BBC last year.

The 35-year-old mother of two was visiting her parents' home in the northern state of Uttarakhand for medical treatment in October 2015 when she received a letter from her husband telling her that he was divorcing her.

Her attempts to reach her husband of 15 years, who lives in the city of Allahabad, have been unsuccessful.

""He's switched off his phone, I have no way of getting in touch with him,"" she told the BBC over phone from her home in the northern state of Uttarakhand. ""I'm worried sick about my children, their lives are getting ruined.""

In February last year, she filed a petition in the Supreme Court, demanding a ban on triple talaq which, she says, allows Muslim men to treat their wives like ""chattels"".

Even though it has been practised for decades, the unilateral instant ""triple talaq"" divorce finds no mention in Sharia or the Koran.

Islamic scholars say the Koran clearly spells out how to issue a divorce - it has to be spread over three months which allows a couple time for reflection and reconciliation.

Activists say most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, have banned triple talaq, but it thrives in India.

In recent years, many Muslim men in India have told their wives they are divorcing them - by letter or telephone, and even by text message.

There have also been instances where Skype, WhatsApp or Facebook have been used for the purpose.",bbc-news
3,White House unaware of deputy lawyer's 'threat to quit over Comey',"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The White House says the decision to sack Mr Comey was based on a memo by Mr Rosenstein.

The White House says it is unaware whether the deputy attorney general threatened to quit after he was blamed for the FBI chief's sacking.

Rod Rosenstein reportedly was on the verge of resigning after the White House cast him as the prime catalyst to fire James Comey, US media reported.

He detailed Mr Comey's ""serious mistakes"" in a memo to President Donald Trump, just prior to the firing.

The sacking of Mr Comey has ignited a firestorm of criticism.

Democrats have called for a special prosecutor to take over the probe of alleged links between the Trump election team and Moscow, which Mr Comey was heading.

Mr Rosenstein reportedly made his threat unless the White House conveyed that the decision began with the president, according to US media.

""I'm not aware of his threatening to resign,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on ABC's programme Good Morning America on Thursday.

She maintained that Mr Trump ""very much had been thinking about letting Mr Comey go since 9 November"".

Lawmakers in Washington are reeling after the White House abruptly removed Mr Comey on Tuesday for his handling of the inquiry over Hillary Clinton's emails.

Critics accuse the Republican president of firing the nation's top law enforcement official because he was leading the Russia inquiry.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year

Senior Democrats have also said they believed Mr Comey had recently asked the justice department for more resources for the FBI Trump-Russia investigation, which they say could have prompted his dismissal.

The White House has rejected the calls to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate allegations the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin over last year's election.

Acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director, was due to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday on the panel's annual hearing on worldwide threats.

The Senate Intelligence Committee has also invited Mr Comey to testify next week.

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed"".

""I have long believed that a president can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all,"" he wrote.

President Trump defended his actions on Wednesday, saying Mr Comey was fired ""because he was not doing a good job"".

But Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein said she ""understood"" that Mr Comey had asked Mr Rosenstein for more resources for the FBI investigation.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump was with Henry Kissinger when he told reporters James Comey was ""not doing a good job"" as FBI chief

Another Democratic Senator, Richard Durbin, told US media be believed the reports to be true, although Justice department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores rejected them as ""totally false"".

Republicans and Democrats vowed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees' investigations into the Russia claims would continue.

The Senate Intelligence Committee moved forward by issuing a rare subpoena for documents from Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's former national security adviser, after he rejected its request to do so in April.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

6,Fact check: Trump's 'nothing to see here' spin on Comey firing,"James Comey testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, on Capitol Hill. (Photo: Shawn Thew, European Pressphoto Agency)

The Trump administration has offered some “nothing to see here” spin in response to the president’s firing of FBI Director James Comey. But President Trump and White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders have twisted some facts to fit that narrative:

Sanders wrongly claimed that former director of national intelligence James Clapper said there was “no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.” Clapper said he was not aware of any evidence, but added that he was not privy to the FBI’s ongoing investigation.

Trump misleadingly tweeted that Sen. Chuck Schumer “stated recently” that he had no confidence in Comey. But those comments from Schumer came before the election — not recently.

Trump said that Comey told him “on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.” We don’t know what Comey told Trump, but we do know that Comey said the FBI is investigating “whether there was any coordination between the [Trump] campaign and Russia’s efforts” to influence the election.

It has been quite a start to the week for the Trump administration. On May 8, former acting attorney general Sally Yates told a Senate subcommittee that she provided early warnings to the Trump administration that its national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had provided deceptive information about his conversations with a Russian official. Yates and Clapper talked about how that could have made Flynn, who was later fired, vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians.

Then, the following day, the president made the surprise announcement that he had fired the head of the agency that is investigating possible links between Trump campaign associates and Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.

What Clapper Knew, and Didn’t Know

On MSNBC’s Morning Joe program, Sanders said the investigations by the FBI and congressional committees have gone for “almost an entire year,” and that “Clapper and others” have all come to the same conclusion, that there’s “no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.”

Her comment mirrors Trump’s tweet two days earlier in which the president claimed the former director of national intelligence said “there is ‘no evidence’ of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.”

Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ""no evidence"" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

That’s not what Clapper said.

Trump’s tweet came in response to an exchange that Clapper had with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on May 8.

Graham asked Clapper about a statement he made in a March 5 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press that “there was no evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials included in an intelligence report that Clapper’s office released on Jan. 6. Here’s what Clapper told host Chuck Todd:

Clapper, March 5: ""We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say, 'our,' that’s NSA, FBI and CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report."" Todd: ""I understand that. But does it exist?"" Clapper: ""Not to my knowledge.""

Graham asked if that was still accurate.

“It is,” Clapper said.

But saying that one is not aware of evidence of collusion, or that no evidence of collusion was included in the report, is not the same thing as saying there is no evidence of it.

In the Meet the Press interview, Clapper went on to say “at the time, we had no evidence of such collusion.” But he added, “This could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left the government.”

At the May 8 hearing, Clapper said he wasn’t even aware of the FBI investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives until March 20. He then explained why he would not have known that when he was the director of national intelligence.

Clapper, May 8: ""When the intelligence community obtains information suggesting that a U.S. person is acting on behalf of a foreign power, the standard procedure is to share that information with the lead investigatory body, which of course is the FBI. The bureau then decides whether to look into that information and handles any ensuing investigation if there is one. Given its sensitivity, even the existence of a counterintelligence investigation’s closely held, including at the highest levels. ""During my tenure as DNI, it was my practice to defer to the FBI director, both Director Mueller and then subsequently Director Comey, on whether, when and to what extent they would inform me about such investigations. This stems from the unique position of the FBI, which straddles both intelligence and law enforcement. And as a consequence, I was not aware of the counterintelligence investigation Director Comey first referred to during his testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee for Intelligence on the 20th of March, and that comports with my public statements.""

To be sure, as part of its investigation into Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 presidential race, the FBI is investigating whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. As Clapper referenced, Comey made that perfectly clear in a House intelligence committee hearing on March 20. (More on that later.)

Schumer on Comey

After firing Comey, Trump took to Twitter to chastise Democrats who criticized the move, particularly those — such as Sen. Chuck Schumer — who have criticized Comey in the past.

When the president called Schumer to tell him about the firing, Schumer said he told Trump, “you are making a big mistake.” In a press conference after the phone call, Schumer called the firing troubling and speculated that perhaps the FBI investigation “was getting too close to home for the president.”

A few hours later, Trump fired back with a tweet suggesting Schumer was being hypocritical, given that he “stated recently” that he did not have any confidence in Comey.

Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, ""I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer."" Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

Actually, Schumer’s quote about Comey was not all that recent.

The White House released a link to an article about Schumer saying — on Nov. 2, 2016 — that he had lost confidence in Comey. That was before the election. Specifically, Schumer was upset that Comey announced the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails just two weeks before the election. Although Schumer criticized Comey, he stopped short of calling for his ouster.

We couldn’t find any more recent quotes in which Schumer spoke directly to Comey’s performance. But on NBC’s Meet the Press on March 5, Schumer provided supportive words for the FBI generally and its ability to conduct its investigation into the Trump campaign “without political interference.”

Schumer, March 5: ""The FBI is the premiere investigative agency here in our government. And I believe that they will do their job and get to the bottom of this without political interference.""

That wasn’t a specific vote of confidence for Comey, but Comey was head of the agency at the time.

More important, Schumer’s comment about lacking confidence in Comey was made more than six months ago, and before the election.

In his press conference on May 9, Schumer said, “The first question [about the firing of Comey] the administration has to answer is, ‘Why now?’ If the administration had objections to the way Director Comey handled the Clinton investigation, they had those objections the minute the president got into office. But they didn’t fire him then. Why did it happen today?”

In his letter firing Comey, Trump said he relied on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions’ deputy, Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein’s memo primarily cites Comey’s “handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton emails.” Specifically, Rosenstein took issue with Comey’s decision to hold a press conference on July 5, 2016, to publicly announce that he would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton and her aides.

After that press conference, Trump blasted Comey and the “crooked” FBI for not prosecuting Clinton, but he frequently quoted the critical comments that Comey made about Clinton at his July 5. 2016, press conference. For example, a Trump campaign document on “Hillary’s Lies” contained five quotes from Comey’s press conference.

After Comey announced he had reopened the investigation two weeks before the election, Trump praised the FBI director. At an Oct. 31 campaign rally, he said Comey had “a lot of guts,” and at an Oct. 29 rally he said he had “respect” for Comey’s decision.

In an April 12 interview on Fox News, Trump was asked why he didn’t fire Comey as soon as he became president. Trump criticized Comey for “saving” Clinton from prosecution, but added, “I have confidence in him. We’ll see what happens. It’s going to be interesting.”

At a May 10 press briefing, Sanders was asked when Trump lost confidence in Comey. She told reporters that “one of the big catalysts” came when Comey testified at a May 3 congressional hearing.

“I think one of the big catalysts that we saw was, last week, on Wednesday, Director Comey made a pretty startling revelation that he had essentially taken a stick of dynamite and thrown it into the Department of Justice by going around the chain of command when he decided to take steps without talking to the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General when holding a press conference and telling them that he would not let them know what he was going to say,” she said, “and that is simply not allowed.”

It is not accurate to describe Comey’s unilateral decision to hold a press conference last year as a “startling revelation.” It’s old news.

In fact, Comey said at his July 5, 2016, press conference that he did not coordinate it with the Department of Justice. At the time, the department was headed by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who came under criticism for an impromptu meeting with Bill Clinton a few days earlier on the tarmac of an airport in Arizona.

“I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government,” Comey said at the start of last year’s press conference. “They do not know what I am about to say.”

Comey’s decision to disclose his recommendation without first consulting with the Department of Justice was part of what The New York Timesdescribed as “a day of political high drama.”

The New York Times, July 5, 2016: ""White House officials said Mr. Obama also did not know about Mr. Comey’s plans ahead of time. The F.B.I. director said he did not coordinate the statement with the Justice Department or any other agency. 'They do not know what I am about to say,' he declared.""

Comey on FBI’s Russia Probe

In his dismissal letter to Comey, Trump said that the FBI director told him “on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.”

Trump, May 9: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.""

We asked the White House when these three occasions took place and exactly what Comey told Trump. We asked, too, for an explanation of what Trump means when he said he is “not under investigation.”

We received no response to our questions, but at her press briefing, Sanders declined to answer. “I’m not going to get into the specifics of their conversations, but I can tell you that Director Comey relayed that information to the president,” she said.

It would be important to know exactly what Comey told Trump. It’s not clear to us what Trump meant when he said, “I am not under investigation.” We asked the White House, for example, if Comey told Trump that he was not the subject or target of an investigation, which has specific legal meaning in the U.S. criminal code.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Manual:

A “target” is a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant. An officer or employee of an organization which is a target is not automatically considered a target even if such officer’s or employee’s conduct contributed to the commission of the crime by the target organization. The same lack of automatic target status holds true for organizations which employ, or employed, an officer or employee who is a target.

A “subject” of an investigation is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury’s investigation.

There is no evidence that the president is a target or a subject. But there is an active, ongoing investigation of his campaign, as Comey confirmed at a March 20 hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He declined to say, however, “whose conduct we are examining,” citing the ongoing investigation.

Here’s what Comey said in his opening remarks:

Comey, March 20: ""As you know, our practice is not to confirm the existence of ongoing investigations, especially those investigations that involve classified matters, but in unusual circumstances where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so as Justice Department policies recognize. This is one of those circumstances. ""I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts. As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. ""Because it is an open, ongoing investigation and is classified, I cannot say more about what we are doing and whose conduct we are examining. At the request of congressional leaders, we have taken the extraordinary step in coordination with the Department of Justice of briefing this Congress’ leaders, including the leaders of this committee, in a classified setting in detail about the investigation, but I can’t go into those details here. I know that is extremely frustrating to some folks. I hope you and the American people can understand. The FBI is very careful in how we handle information about our cases and about the people we are investigating.""

During questioning, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes asked Comey whether the FBI investigation of the Trump campaign was still in its early stages. Comey characterized the length of the investigation, which at that point was less than a year, as “a fairly short period of time.”

“It’s hard to say because I don’t know how much longer it will take,” Comey said. “But we’ve been doing this — this investigation began in late July, so for counterintelligence investigation that’s a fairly short period of time.”

Again, we don’t know what Comey told the president, but there is still an ongoing investigation. We will update this article if we do get more information from the White House or Comey.

3,More states follow Trump's assault on 'sanctuary cities',"In this May 1, 2017, photo, protesters against the Senate Bill 4 sanctuary cities ban rally outside the Texas Department of Insurance building where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has an office in Austin, Texas. (Photo: Jay Janner, AP)

At least 33 states considered laws this year to crack down on “sanctuary cities” — nearly double the number from 2016 — following President Trump’s moves against communities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi and Texas already passed laws this year that punish local governments and public universities that enact policies to protect undocumented immigrants, and other states are trying to follow suit.

Last year 18 states considered such laws, compared with only four in 2015, according to he National Conference of State Legislatures.

The rush comes after Trump's repeated warnings on the campaign trail about the dangers caused by ""sanctuary cities"" and his actions since taking office to cut off their federal funding.

""There's more sanctuary activity at the state and local level because of the president's marshaling confidence,"" said Dale Wilcox, executive director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, which has helped state lawmakers craft their bills. ""This is what the president's executive order on sanctuary jurisdictions was meant to hammer home.""

""Sanctuary city"" is not a legal term, but a general description of more than 300 state and local jurisdictions that have some kind of policy that limits their cooperation with federal immigration efforts. Critics say those policies allow dangerous and violent undocumented immigrants to roam free, threatening the safety of their communities. Supporters say the policies are a legal and moral counter to demands from the Trump administration for local officials to conduct immigration enforcement, a federal responsibility.

The Department of Homeland Security has issued several reports to publicly shame sanctuary cities, and the Justice Department has sent letters to at least nine localities threatening to withhold federal grants if they do not fully comply with federal immigration efforts. Homeland Security suspended its reports because they were filled with errors, and a federal court heavily restricted Justice's funding threats, but state efforts continue.

The flurry of state laws this year is similar to 2010, when Arizona passed a law cracking down on undocumented immigrants and a half-dozen states soon followed with their measures. Many of those Arizona-style laws were struck down in the courts.

""Arizona proved to the rest of the country that (its law) was unconstitutional, bad policy and bad for business,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which advocates on behalf of immigrants. ""Now it seems like other states want to repeat that mistake.""

Read more:

After the 2010 wave of laws, the Justice Department under President Barack Obama sued several states in federal court, resulting in many of the measures being struck down. Wilcox pointed out those states can now move forward without worries the federal government will file a lawsuit.

""They know they won't get attacked by the DOJ (Justice Department), like Arizona or Alabama did under Obama,"" Wilcox said.

Kansas state Rep. John Whitmer, a Republican who filed an anti-sanctuary bill this year, said the increase in state legislation is because of the growing number of states and cities adopting sanctuary policies.

Whitmer said his bill, which he doesn't believe will pass, was a direct response to cities like Lawrence, Kan., that have shown a ""flippant disregard for immigration law"" by embracing sanctuary policies.

""This is our way of saying, 'OK, fine, you do it your way, and we'll see to it that you don't do it here,'"" he said.

9,"Kevin Durant questions importance of NBA combine, tells players to skip it","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Kevin Durant had an embarrassing experience at the NBA Combine in 2007. Now the former No. 2 pick is urging NBA prospects to skip the Combine completely. USA TODAY Sports

Warriors forward Kevin Durant doesn't think much of the NBA combine. (Photo: Chris Nicoll, USA TODAY Sports)

Before Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant was an NBA MVP and one of the league’s top talents, he was a scrawny 6-foot-9 scorer from Texas who received snickers from strength coaches because he couldn’t bench press 185 pounds.

So it should come as no surprise that Durant, speaking to ESPN while the Warriors prep for the Western Conference finals, dismissed the NBA draft combine and its importance altogether.

His advice for lottery picks in a situation similar to his 10 years ago?

“Stay your (expletive) home, work out and get better on your own time,” Durant said regarding the trend of elite players skipping the draft combine. Top-projected picks Lonzo Ball and Josh Jackson opted not to do drills in Chicago this year. The combine began on Tuesday and wraps up on Sunday.

""I knew nobody in that draft could guard me one-on-one,"" Durant said. ""I knew that for sure. I knew that. And I knew that you don't need to (bench-press) to lift a basketball up. And I knew that this wasn't football, where that stuff matters. I knew as a basketball player, I had a lot of skill, more skill than anybody in the draft. And I knew that if I worked as hard as I could, then that (expletive) wouldn't matter at the end of the day. It still doesn't matter. I was ranked the last person in camp, drills-wise. I was the worst player, and the first player didn't get drafted. That tells you a lot about the significance of that (expletive).

""Now (players aren't attending), but back then, every player was there ... But now, you're getting players to where they realize their power and they're not doing it, and more power to them ... But back then, I wish I would have known the power I had or I probably wouldn't have done it, either.”

Durant was drafted second overall to the Seattle Supersonics in 2007, but he still holds bitterness about the combine based on his experience. The eight-time All-Star also got low marks in the vertical leap, agility drill and three-quarter-court sprint.

""I remember it like it was yesterday,"" Durant said. ""All the strength coaches were laughing at me and (expletive). They were giggling with each other that I couldn't lift 185 pounds, and I was like, 'All right, keep laughing. Keep laughing.' It was a funny thing, because I was the only one that couldn't lift it and I was struggling to lift it. I was embarrassed at that point, but I'm like, 'Give me a basketball, please. Give me a ball.' ""

Durant, to this day, said he’s not a fan of bench pressing.

""I haven't tried. I know I can lift 185, though, now, but I don't bench-press,"" Durant said.",usa-today
6,Trump to appoint 'voter fraud' commission as controversy over FBI firing continues,"President Trump (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)

WASHINGTON – President Trump is expected to appoint a commission on Thursday to study his unproven allegations of voter fraud in last year's presidential election, as he continues to grapple with the fallout from his abrupt and controversial firing of FBI Director James Comey.

Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach will be chairman and vice-chairman of the commission, which is expected to be composed largely of state and local election officials from both parties, officials said

""The Commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American people's confidence in the integrity of Federal elections – including improper registrations, improper voting, fraudulent registrations, fraudulent voting, and voting suppression,"" the White House said in a statement.

Trump, who lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 2.9 million votes, has claimed that last year's election included up to 3 to 5 million fraudulent voters – but there is no evidence to back this assertion.

Trump plans to sign an executive order creating the commission as Democrats and other critics accuse him of firing Comey to obstruct an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russians who tried to influence last year's election.

The president is planning a visit to the FBI headquarters in the coming days to calm the waters, administration officials said. But the unexpected announcement of the new commission – which was not on Trump's public schedule for the day – might be seen as a way to distract from the firestorm unleashed by the Comey firing earlier this week.

Meanwhile, federal and state election officials from both parties have disputed Trump's claims of massive voter fraud. They say there have been few, if any, incidents of people voting when they were not registered – or voting by people who were not American citizens.

""Every election is going to have issues, but I don’t think that three to five million people voting illegally was one of those issues,"" said Thomas Hicks, chairman of the federal Election Assistance Commission said in January in USA TODAY.

Election officials have said they worry Trump’s claims could shake the faith of voters, particularly at a time when the FBI and Congress are investigating whether Russia interfered in last year’s presidential election.

For his part, Trump has stood by his claim.

""We'll see after the committee,"" Trump told Time magazine in March.

Trump had originally been expected to sign the executive order creating the voter commission in late January, but it has been consistently been put off.

Already, voting rights advocates are blasting Thursday's expected order.

“In no uncertain terms we condemn the launch of this so-called Presidential Commission on Election Integrity,’’ Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement. “President Trump is trying to create a distraction from actual threats to our democracy, such as ongoing voter suppression and Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.’’

Voting rights advocates say the administration should focus on making access to the polls easier instead of unfounded claims of voter fraud. They argue some lawmakers are using the claim to ramp up more restrictive election laws.

States, mostly controlled by Republican legislatures, have adopted more election laws, including voter ID, in recent years. Supporters say they help protect against voter fraud.

Trump's order get support from some Republican lawmakers, who have welcomed a federal investigation into allegations of voter fraud.

“Safeguarding our democracy requires fair and accurate elections,” Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., chairman of the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal elections, said earlier this year.

9,Joe Maddon has a very unusual explanation for the Cubs' slow start | FOX Sports,"The World Series champion Chicago Cubs are sitting at 17-17 heading into this weekend’s series against the NL Central-leading St. Louis Cardinals. And manager Joe Maddon has an interesting theory behind the slow start.

“I sense sleep deprivation more than anything,” he told reporters Tuesday, via the Chicago Sun-Times. “I think right from the beginning of the year our schedule’s been kind of awkward. Nobody’s really had a chance to settle in.

“I don’t think anybody’s taking anything for granted. On the flip side of that, I’ve always said I love the word ‘expectations,’ and I do. But understand it’s going to be a different path this year. It is. It just has to be.”

Supporting Maddon’s case is that the Cubs have played three Sunday night games already this season, including this past Sunday’s game that went 18 innings.

Fatigue? World Series hangover? Rotation woes? Subpar defense? Whatever the case, it’s worth noting that the Cubs were 26-8 after 34 games last season.

Perhaps they just need to get back home and in their own beds. And they will: After leaving St. Louis, the Cubs will begin a 10-game homestand at Wrigley Field, where they are just 7-9 so far this season.

9,Eagles GM weighs in on report that DE Brandon Graham is planning a holdout | FOX Sports,"One day after there were conflicting reports as to whether Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham will hold out during organized team activities later this month, the team’s GM addressed the situation in a Thursday interview with PFT Live.

Philly.com cited NFL sources that said Graham, a second-team All-Pro last season with 5.5 sacks, has stopped attending workouts and is expected to skip OTAs and possibly a mandatory June minicamp if the Eagles don’t renegotiate his contract. CBSSports.com had a different take.

Reports of Brandon Graham contract dispute are unsubstantiated. Am told he's with his family in Detroit and eager for the season to start — Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) May 10, 2017

“This media-on-media crime, I just like being a bystander to it. It’s kind of fun to watch,” Roseman told PFT Live. “I may have a rooting interest in who I’m rooting for.”

Roseman did not, though, put to rest the notion that the 29-year-old Graham may be dissatisfied with a four-year $26 million contract that will pay him $6.5 million in each of its last two seasons.

“That’s a better question for him. I don’t talk about contracts of our players. Those are personal. … I would say every day that Brandon’s been in here, and the only days he hasn’t been in here are the last couple, he’s had tremendous attitude, tremendous work ethic, and all our conversations with him have been tremendously positive.”",fox-sports

3,"In India, instant Islamic divorces — known as 'triple talaq' — face a supreme court challenge","Muslim women in India are challenging a form of instant divorce known as ""triple talaq."" (Photo: Farooq Khan, EPA)

Imagine if getting a divorce only took having to mumble (or email or text) three words to your wife and the whole thing would be over.

Now the practice, which is banned in much of the Islamic world, faces a test in India — home to the world’s third-largest group of Muslims and one of the last places it is permitted — as the nation’s supreme court considers a case seeking to end the custom.

In “triple talaq,” a man only has to say or write the word “talaq” (divorce) to his wife three times, and the marriage is considered to be over.

There have even been instances where Skype, WhatsApp or Facebook have been used for the purpose.

According to the BBC, the case is being heard by a bench of five judges — a Hindu, a Sikh, a Christian, a Zoroastrian and a Muslim. The suit, which is supported by the government of reformist Prime Minister Narenda Modi, is the result of several petitions by rights groups and Muslim women.

Meanwhile, Muslims who support the practice cite the separation of government and religion, the BBC reported, and that the courts have no role in reviewing it.

Also at issue is the plight of the divorced women in a country with almost no safety nets, who either end up back with their parents or facing extreme poverty. According to Britain’s Guardian newspaper, a woman divorced under India’s secular laws is entitled to a third of her ex-husband’s salary while she most often receives nothing following triple talaq.

Mother-of-two Shayara Bano, 35, one of the petitioners challenging the ritual, told the BBC that she was visiting her parents in her home state in October 2015 when she received a letter from her husband telling her that he was divorcing her and cutting off communication.

""He's switched off his phone, I have no way of getting in touch with him,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm worried sick about my children, their lives are getting ruined.""

A women’s rights activist, Zakia Soman, told the Guardian that triple talaq is “a totally unilateral” and one-sided. “The wife need not be present,” she added. “She need not even be aware.”



RELATED STORIES



The custom persists in India, the paper reported, in part because the British, who ruled India until 1947, permitted India’s huge number of religious groups to run their faiths separate from government regulations. After independence, much of the Indian legal system became based on colonial-era practices, meaning that Muslims can be governed by the Islamic laws, known as sharia.

Soman, however, says sharia has no references to talaq. “Triple talaq is totally un-Quranic,” she told the Guardian . “The Quran nowhere has any mention of it. A Muslim marriage is a social contract and the right to divorce is given to both husband and wife.

“The Quran insists that if and when divorce happens it has to be just and fair to both parties,” she added.

Testimony in the case is expected to end on May 19 with a decision coming several weeks later.

It was too much for one night, really – the Washington Capitals, Washington Wizards and Washington Nationals were all playing on Wednesday evening in games of descending importance. The big one was Capitals vs. Penguins Game 7 -- again, seemingly for the 20th straight year, the two teams would meet in a do-or-die game, which the Penguins had won every time before.

You know how things turned out. The Penguins did it again, winning on Washington’s ice 2-0, in a game that the Capitals mercifully never even really got their fans’ hopes up for.

The Wizards, in a big playoff game of their own against the Celtics, got run off the court, losing 123-101 in a game that never felt all that much in doubt.

6,Comey firing puts Trump's most cherished trait on center stage: Loyalty,"Trump fumed last week when FBI Director James Comey told senators that it made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think he tipped the balance in the 2016 campaign. A longtime Trump friend told CNN it made the President ""white hot.""

Another source close to the now-former FBI director said Trump fired Comey because he never provided the President with any assurance of personal loyalty.

That explanation tracks with the businessman-turned-politician's decades in the private sector, where he wrote and spoke repeatedly about the importance of loyalty, casting the trait as something every leader must demand from their employees.

Comey's firing has put that deep seated Trump desire on center stage, bringing to bear how the President's business history -- and management style -- are influencing the day-to-day operations of his White House.

During a question-and-answer session from The Learning Annex Wealth Expo, Trump was asked for the ""key things"" a boss should look for when hiring someone and building a team.

Trump was blunt.

""The thing that's most important to me is loyalty,"" Trump said. ""You can't hire loyalty. I've had people over the years who I swore were loyal to me, and it turned out that they weren't. Then I've had people that I didn't have the same confidence in and turned out to be extremely loyal. So you never really know.""

He added: ""The thing I really look for though, over the longer term, is loyalty.""

Read the books

This answer, along with the book he wrote with Trump in 2009, led Bill Zanker, the president and founder of The Learning Annex, to write: ""Loyalty is important to Trump and is a wonderful trait to have in business.""

Trump and Zanker worked together on ""Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life,"" their 2009 how-to book on business that is chock full of Trump's musing about loyalty.

""I try to hire people who are honest and loyal. I value loyalty very much,"" they wrote.

""I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well,"" they wrote a few pages after. ""I go out of my way for the people who were loyal to me in bad times.""

Trump also uses the book to slam people who he views as disloyal, including contestants on his NBC show ""The Apprentice,"" former employees and even former Democratic New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.

""Bill Clinton is a great guy with courage, Mario Cuomo is a disloyal guy without courage,"" Trump wrote.

Listen to the former employees

Former Trump employees and campaign aides, who requested anonymity to speak bluntly, told CNN that this isn't just mindless writing from the commander in chief. He truly craves loyalty and has for much of his career, they said.

One adviser said that this need is why Trump brought people like Keith Schiller, his longtime bodyguard and adviser, into the White House. Schiller, the adviser said, has many strengths, including his knowledge of Trump's wants and needs. But it is his unflinching loyalty to the president that cemented his role, they said.

Schiller's fidelity to Trump was on full display Tuesday, when the former New York Police Department detective hand-delivered the letter that informed the FBI the President was canning Comey.

Some of Trump's love of loyalty, another former employee said, stems from Trump's lawyer-turned-mentor, Roy Cohn.

Cohn, who first met Trump in 1973, was known for his toughness and ability to spin even the worst news into something that favored his client.

Cohn first represented Trump when the Justice Department accused the young real estate developer and his father, Fred Trump, of housing discrimination in 1973. Cohn came back with a $100 million countersuit and, two years later, the Trumps settled. That episode cemented Trump's relationship with the controversial figure and led Trump to cribbing some of Cohn's philosophies.

""Sometimes I think that next to loyalty, toughness was the most important thing in the world to him,"" Trump wrote of Cohn in his 1997 text ""The Art of the Deal.""

""He was a truly loyal guy -- it was a matter of honor with him,"" Trump wrote. ""And because he was also very smart, he was a great guy to have on your side.""",cnn
6,Rosenstein unhappy with handling of Comey firing,"Washington (CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has told officials he is unhappy with the way the White House handled the firing of FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.

Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Flores, however, said Rosenstein did not threaten to resign over Comey's ouster, contrary to The Washington Post and other press reports. Flores said she spoke with Rosenstein.

Comey was addressing employees in the FBI's Los Angeles field office when a television screen tuned to Fox News flashed a banner saying he had resigned. He had not, and he took it as a joke. But soon thereafter, CNN on another television monitor nearby reported that he had been fired.

Rosenstein also is unhappy about the fact that White House officials have tried to pin the Comey firing on him, using his reputation as cover for how it was done, the sources said.

Vice President Mike Pence and deputy White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday repeatedly cited Rosenstein's memo on Comey recommending the FBI director's removal, leveraging his reputation and bipartisan Senate confirmation vote

WASHINGTON – In his first appearance as acting FBI director, Andrew McCabe told a Senate panel Thursday that the abrupt dismissal of Director James Comey has not impeded the bureau's ongoing inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Russian government.

""Simply put, you cannot not stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,'' McCabe assured the Senate Intelligence Committee. McCabe was appointed to lead the bureau following President Trump's abrupt firing of Comey on Tuesday.

In firing Comey, President Trump said he appreciated the former director's three separate assurances that he was not under FBI investigation.

Yet McCabe declined to respond to a question about whether Comey did indeed assure Trump that he was not a target of bureau's ongoing counterintelligence probe. The acting director said he was not in a position to comment or whether such communications occurred.

Senators appeared concerned about whether the White House might try to interfere with the investigation in Comey's absence.

Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., the panel's top Democrat, asked McCabe if he would promise to alert the panel if the White House seeks to ""quash the (Russia) investigation.""

The acting director replied: ""I absolutely do.""

Warner, meanwhile, called Comey's dismissal a ""shocking development.""

""The timing of Director Comey’s dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling... For many people, including myself, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the president’s decision to remove Director Comey was related to this investigation. And that is unacceptable.''

The Senate panel, which is conducting a separate congressional inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, announced late Wednesday that it sent a subpoena to Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn for information about his communications with Russian officials that might be relevant to the panel’s inquiry.

Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and vice chairman Warner said that Flynn had declined an earlier request to provide the records voluntarily.

""The committee first requested these documents in an April 28, 2017 letter to... Flynn, but he declined, through counsel, to cooperate with the committee’s request,'' the panel leaders said.

Flynn was fired by President Donald Trump in February, after news reports revealed that the former Army lieutenant general lied to administration officials about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the inauguration.

Flynn and other former Trump advisers Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Roger Stone also are subjects of the FBI inquiry, the Senate Intelligence inquiry and a separate review by the House Intelligence Committee.

While Flynn's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the subpoena, he has previously offered to provide testimony to the FBI and to the congressional panels in exchange for immunity against prosecution. But his request was denied by lawmakers and federal investigators, who say it is too early to consider such an offer.

Earlier this week, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates told a separate Senate panel that she was so troubled that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his December conversations with the Russian ambassador that she warned the White House counsel that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail and could even face criminal charges.

At separate Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, strongly suggested that Comey had indeed recently briefed its members that Trump was not a target of the FBI's inquiry.

Lawmakers are prohibited from revealing the contents of classified briefings, but he urged that the FBI make the status of its investigation public.

""Mr. Comey did brief (ranking committee Democrat) Feinstein and me on who the targets of the various investigations are,'' Grassley said. ""It would not be appropriate for me to reveal those details before the professionals conducting the investigations are ready. I will not answer any questions about who are targets of the ongoing Russia investigations.

""But I will say this: Shortly after Director Comey briefed us, I tweeted that he should be transparent,"" Grassley continued. ""Now Mr. Comey is no longer the FBI director, but the FBI...should confirm to the public whether it is or is not investigating the President. Because it has failed to make this clear, speculation has run rampant.""

6,Poll: Unemployed Americans were more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton,"This Sept. 26, 2016 file photo shows Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. (Photo: David Goldman, AP)

Unemployed Americans were more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election -- but they were almost just as likely not to vote at all, according to a new survey out Wednesday.

Per the survey, released by Express Employment Professionals, 35% of unemployed people voted for Hillary Clinton while 25% voted for Donald Trump. Another 34% said they didn’t vote at all.

Still, they had mixed views on the Trump administration and policy issues.

39% said the administration would have “positive impact” on creating jobs, while 35% said it would have a “negative impact” on jobs

57% were in favor of appealing the Affordable Care Act, while 43% were not

58% said it would be easier to find a job if there was less illegal immigration, and 42% did not

“While Democrats and Republicans seem to be polarized, the views of the unemployed appears to be much more mixed,” Bob Funk of Express Employee Professionals said in a statement. “Despite the political commentary, political opinion is not as black and white—or red and blue—as we are often led to believe.”

The survey was conducted from March 14 to April 6 and surveyed 1,500 adults who were 18 or older and were unemployed but capable of working. People who were retired, choose to stay home or can’t work because of long-term disability weren’t included in the survey.

Then, for cinema I reckon Curzon membership is one of the best – you get four free tickets and 15% off everything else for £60 nationwide (or £45 at a single local branch). Considering tickets in London are about £15 a pop, you're essentially getting the 15% off for free by buying four tickets in advance. AND IT'S SUCH A NICE CINEMA. I feel so fancy when I go to Curzon cinemas. But if you want something cheaper, both the Odeon and Cineworld have monthly memberships for about £17 that lets you watch as much as you want for free.

9,Derek Jeter pens a heartfelt thank you to New York ahead of jersey retirement | FOX Sports,"The New York Yankees will retire Derek Jeter’s legendary No. 2 jersey Sunday and enshrine him into Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. But before 55,000 fans say thank you to Jeter, the lifelong Yankee decided to thank them — and the entire city.

Jeter, whose 20th and final season in pinstripes came in 2014, write a touching tribute on The Players’ Tribune. Calling himself a ‘kid who grew up in the Midwest’ and a ‘homebody at heart,’ Jeter thanked New York City for taking him in and helping to make him great.

From his post:

“Thank you, New York, for asking a lot of me. For challenging me. For giving this kid a place to grow up. I wasn’t born a New Yorker — you asked me to earn it. I wasn’t born a Yankee, but you made me into one.

Everyone comes to this city with dreams of being No. 1. You showed me that being No. 2 was more than enough.

Today I’m no longer that kid. I’ve hung up my uniform, and I know this much for a fact: I wouldn’t be the person I am today without you. Because the truth is, no matter where you go in the world, when a place feels like home, as New York does to me, you never really leave.

It will always be with you.”

Jeter finished his career with five World Series rings, a World Series MVP Award, five Gold Gloves and 3,465 hits — just to name a few of his notable achievements. And on Sunday he will get the ultimate honor from the franchise that drafted him sixth overall in 1992.

6,New acting FBI director contradicts White House on Comey,"(CNN) Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe disputed Thursday the White House's assertion that FBI employees had lost faith in James Comey, saying the former FBI chief had ""broad support"" within the agency.

""I hold Director Comey in the absolute highest regard. I have the highest respect for his considerable abilities and his integrity,"" McCabe told members of the Senate intelligence committee.

He said Comey enjoyed ""broad support within the FBI and still does to this day."" He added, ""The majority, the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep, positive connection to Director Comey.""

On Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said that the President ""and the rest of the FBI"" had lost confidence in Comey. She said the White House had heard from ""countless"" members of the FBI to that effect.

McCabe also said there has been no effort to impede the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the election, but vowed to inform a Senate panel if the White House tried to intervene.

McCabe was testifying on Capitol Hill two days after President Donald Trump fired his predecessor amid reports he was infuriated about the bureau's probe into whether his campaign aides colluded with Moscow. McCabe said nothing could prevent the FBI from ""doing the right thing"" but promised to tell the Senate intelligence committee if any attempt was made to thwart the investigation.

Amid reports that Comey had asked for more resources for the Russia investigation, McCabe testified that he believed the bureau had adequate resources to complete the job. He was asked by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio whether the dismissal of Comey had ""in any way impeded, interrupted, stopped or negatively impacted"" the investigation.

""As you know, senator, the work of the men and women of the FBI continues despite any changes in circumstance, any decisions, so there has been no effort to impede our investigation to date,"" McCabe told members of the Senate intelligence committee. ""Simply put, sir, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.""

In an earlier question from ranking Democrat Mark Warner, he vowed ""absolutely"" to inform the committee if Trump's White house did take steps to interfere.

The man who stepped into Comey's shoes is getting a public baptism of fire. The acting FBI director is a part of a hearing testifying in place of his former boss, who had been due to appear before his dismissal.

He is seated alongside other top intelligence chiefs for a hearing on global threats to the United States and its allies but is likely to face questions, particularly from Democratic senators, about what he knows about Comey's firing and about the integrity of the bureau's investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the last year's election and whether any of Trump's campaign aides may have cooperated with Moscow.

McCabe refuted reports, highlighted by the White House that there was a widespread loss of confidence among the rank and file in Comey's leadership.

""No sir, that is not accurate,"" he told Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich.

Burr, a North Carolina Republican, opened the event by asking the panel's members to focus on the original topic of the hearing -- discussing ""World Wide Threats"" -- a request Warner said would be difficult to accommodate.

""It is impossible to ignore that one of the leaders of the intelligence community is not here with us today,"" the Virginia senator said in his opening remarks. ""The President's firing of FBI Director Comey Tuesday night was a shocking development. The timing of Director Comey's dismissal to me and to many members of the committee on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling.""

McCabe took part in a private meeting with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, after deputy White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the President would talk to him about morale at the bureau following Comey's departure.

Burr has also expressed concern about Comey's firing.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" Burr tweeted.

""His dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.""

Alongside McCabe at the witness table on Thursday will be Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Admiral Michael Rogers, who heads the National Security Agency, Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and Robert Cardillo, who runs the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

British actor Geoffrey Bayldon has died at the age of 93, his agency has confirmed.

He was best known for playing the lead role in TV series Catweazle, and the Crowman in Worzel Gummidge.

The actor's film credits include To Sir With Love and The Pink Panther Strikes Again, as well as big-screen versions of Porridge and Steptoe and Son.

He famously turned down the lead role in Doctor Who twice, but did eventually make an appearance on the show in 1979.

Image caption Bayldon's TV credits include Heartbeat, Casualty and My Family

Bayldon was born in Leeds on 7 January 1924.

After studying at the Hull College of Architecture, he began acting and trained at the Old Vic Theatre School.

He went on to star in a whole host of films and TV shows - including playing Q in 1967's Casino Royale, which was loosely based on Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel.

But it was his roles in Catweazle, which ran for two years from 1970, and Worzel Gummidge, which ran from 1979-81, that were his most famous.

Bayldon also made appearances in TV series including Z-Cars, The Avengers and The Tomorrow People and, more recently, Heartbeat, Casualty and My Family.

10,Microsoft unveils the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update,"Microsoft has announced that its next big update to Windows 10 will be the Fall Creators Update and it’s coming later this year.

You might be thinking, ‘wait a minute, didn’t the Creators Update just roll out?’ And you’d be right, but Microsoft says their not done making its operating system even better for creative types.

Windows Story Remix

At the center of this upcoming Windows 10 build is a new creative app called Windows Story Remix. Its most interesting aspect is that it allows users to create mixed reality content. Microsoft demoed the app by adding 3D objects to photos and video to help tell stories users can explore.

Otherwise, the new app is essentially about helping users create shareable memories out of their photos and videos by automatically stitching them together. From there, users can add little creative touches like a soundtrack, theme, cinematic transitions (read: star wipes), or even draw and write on them with Windows Ink.

Windows Story Remix is also a collaborative app, that allows users to share media. For example multiple parents could all shoot different angles of a soccer game and the app will automatically pull together the footage to create a highlight reel.

With face recognition, users could also tell Windows Story remix to make a certain person the start of the video.

While this app is currently untitled, it seems like it will be an interesting new wrinkle to the Windows 10 experience and feels like a perfect fit for Windows 10 Mobile and its lineup of smartphones – which we have no doubt it will land on eventually.

Fluent Design System

At the heart of the Fall Creators Update is a new user interface called the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which both changes the look and how you interact with apps. Originally code named Project Neon , Fluent Design will drive more expressive and engaging apps for a wide range of devices.

Secondly, the new design language hopes to tackle input diversity head on. With a modern Windows 10 device, users can interact with touch, ink, voice, gaze and gesture. Simply put, Fluent Design hopes to create a more harmonious and responsive cross-device experience.

Pick up and go

Speaking of cross-device experiences, the Fall Creators Update comes with new features specifically designed for those who flip from one device to the next.

Microsoft introduced Timeline to help users jump back into what they were working on. It works by showing users a visual timeline of their desktop so they can get right back into the files, apps and sites they were accessing at the time. At a basic level, it’s a lot like MacOS’ Time Machine, but for revisiting your desktop state from an earlier time and place.

Beyond your PC, Cortana enables the same Pick Up Where You Left Off across a wider variety of Windows, iOS and Android devices. Microsoft gave the example of being able to work on a doc on the PC and Cortana asking a user whether they would like to finish it up on a phone.

Last but not least, Clipboard brings universal copy and paste to Windows devices and beyond. Aside from just clipping text and web links, Clipboard also allows users to transfer photos and animated GIFs from a Windows PC to their preferred mobile device.",techradar

The NFL has denied Cleveland Browns receiver Josh Gordon’s recent reinstatement petition, but he may apply again this fall, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the league had made no announcement about Gordon, who hasn’t played since the 2014 season while banished under the NFL’s substance-abuse policy.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell conditionally reinstated Gordon, 26, last year and said he’d be eligible to return after serving a four-game suspension to start the season. But Gordon checked into rehab days before the suspension was set to end.

There’s little question about Gordon’s talent when he’s on the field. He had 87 catches for 1,646 yards and nine touchdowns in 2013. But he has played in just five regular-season games since – all late in 2014, when he caught 24 passes for 303 yards.

John Cena has grappled with Dwayne Johnson in the ring before, and now he, too, is wrestling Hollywood for a place in mainstream pop culture.

Cena stars alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a pair of soldiers who get pinned down by an Iraqi sniper in the war movie The Wall (in theaters nationwide Friday). It’s a more serious effort than what the 16-time WWE champion has been doing lately — guesting on The Today Show, hosting the Kids’ Choice Awards — though it falls right into Cena’s mindset as a cross-platform entertainer.

“You have to constantly tell a new and interesting story,” says Cena, 40, who had two scene-stealing comedic turns in 2015 as Amy Schumer’s musclehead boyfriend in Trainwreck and a tattooed drug dealer opposite Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in Sisters. “It's just luck, shaking hands and preparation, and then you have to take a little bit of a risk and you see what happens.”

The flattop-wearing, all-American Cena’s social media game is as rock solid as his biceps (with 43.8 million Facebook likes and 9.5 million Twitter followers), and he gets a huge reaction whenever he returns to the ring. But how does Cena compare to someone like Johnson, the charismatic Fast and Furious franchise star and reigning Sexiest Man Alive?

""The Rock is the gold standard when it comes to a wrestler creating a career out of whole cloth,” says comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. Cena, though, “absolutely” has the potential of being a strong box-office draw. “The path he’s taking is really smart: show a funnier side so people can get past his intimidating exterior.”

John Cena (right) had a scene-stealing role opposite Amy Schumer in the comedy 'Trainwreck.' (Photo: Universal Pictures)

Like Johnson, Cena dipped his toes first into action-movie waters in the mid-2000s, with The Marine and 12 Rounds, but “I didn’t like it. Doing the last film, I remember saying, ‘Well, I’m never doing movies again.’ ” He came around in the 2010s with a very different role, playing an imaginary dad in three Fred: The Movie comedies for Nickelodeon. “It was like, ‘Hey, you don’t have to be this tough impenetrable force of an action star. You can be a goofball.’ ”

In addition to Trainwreck and Sisters, embracing his quirkier side has led Cena to voicing a nut-addicted pachyderm in Wonderful Pistachios commercials and the title pacifist bull of the upcoming animated film Ferdinand (in theaters Dec. 15); reprising his role as an intimidating stepfather with Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg in Daddy’s Home 2 (Nov. 10); and playing a father worried about his teenage daughter losing her virginity in The Pact, which begins filming soon in Atlanta.

“You become a movie star by finding what you’re great at and just doing that for as long as you can,” says writer Dave Schilling, who covers wrestling for the news site Bleacher Report and film for BirthMoviesDeath.com. Cena’s “look, his haircut, everything about him is very straight man-y. It engenders a lot of humor putting him in weird situations.”

Because Johnson’s popularity is “lightning in a bottle,” it would be difficult for Cena to completely replicate his success, Dergarabedian adds. But, “you get enough John Cena fans following his career, plug him into different movies and he draws a whole new crowd to the multiplex based on his star power.”

4,19 Surprising Ways To Save A Little Money,"I bloody love all of the above things, and one of the best ways to save money if you're a culture vulture is to invest in a card that'll get you discounts or even in for free for a full year. I currently have the National Art Pass, which is £65 (or you can get two for £97 and go half with a buddy) for 12 months, which seems like a lot, but it gives you free entry to literally all the major art galleries around the country, as well as 50% off exhibitions.

Then, for cinema I reckon Curzon membership is one of the best – you get four free tickets and 15% off everything else for £60 nationwide (or £45 at a single local branch). Considering tickets in London are about £15 a pop, you're essentially getting the 15% off for free by buying four tickets in advance. AND IT'S SUCH A NICE CINEMA. I feel so fancy when I go to Curzon cinemas. But if you want something cheaper, both the Odeon and Cineworld have monthly memberships for about £17 that lets you watch as much as you want for free.

This also works for food and drink too – Taste Tripper is a really cool tour company that lets you buy an ""Explorer Pack"" – you pay an upfront price for a pack that includes a bunch of coffees, chocolate or beer at local spots, and each one works out cheaper than full price.

3,FBI acting boss Andrew McCabe stands by Russia probe,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Andrew McCabe said the FBI had full faith in James Comey

The FBI investigation into alleged links between Russia and the Donald Trump election team will carry on unimpeded by the sacking of its head, James Comey, his successor has said.

The firing has sparked a storm of criticism but Acting Director Andrew McCabe told a Senate committee it had not affected the work of the FBI.

And he vowed to speak up if there were any political interference in future.

Critics accuse Mr Trump of firing Mr Comey for leading the Russia inquiry.

There are reports the ex-FBI boss had asked for more resources to conduct the probe and Democrats in the US Senate have formally requested details from the Justice Department on any additional funding he requested.

Some Democratic senators say they believed the reports to be true, although a Justice Department spokeswoman rejected them as ""totally false"".

Democrats have also called for a special prosecutor to take over the Russia investigation.

But the White House maintains Mr Comey was fired because his competence had come into question over the way he handled the case of Democratic Party election candidate Hillary Clinton's emails, and that he had lost the confidence of his staff.

Mr McCabe contradicted this by telling the Senate Intelligence Committee the Mr Comey had the support of the rank and file.

In other developments:

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed""

The president is ""very likely"" to visit the FBI headquarters in the next few days, says the White House

FBI staff speaking to Politico have contradicted White House statements that Mr Comey had lost the faith of the agency

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was reportedly on the verge of resigning after the White House cast him as the prime catalyst for firing Mr Comey, US media reported.

He detailed Mr Comey's ""serious mistakes"" in a memo to President Trump, just prior to the firing.

Mr Rosenstein reportedly made his threat unless the White House conveyed that the decision began with the president, according to US media.

""I'm not aware of his threatening to resign,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on ABC's programme Good Morning America on Thursday.

She maintained that Mr Trump ""very much had been thinking about letting Mr Comey go since 9 November"".

Rosenstein's way out - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Rod Rosenstein brought a reputation for even-handedness and probity with him to the job of deputy attorney general. Two weeks later, that reputation is being put to the test.

Such is life in the Trump White House, where every appointee and aide is just one tweet, event or press conference away from the maelstrom.

On Tuesday night, as the administration press shop scrambled to explain the president's surprise decision to sack his FBI director, Trump supporters leaned hard on Mr Rosenstein's credentials to paint the move as a nonpartisan decision based on Mr Comey's overall job performance.

The deputy attorney general reportedly balked at the characterisation that he was the driving force behind Mr Comey's dismissal, however.

Mr Rosenstein's threat to resign is different than actually packing bags, of course, and his fate at this point is still tethered firmly to the president he chose to serve.

There is a way out, though. Due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal on the matter, it's Mr Rosenstein's call whether to appoint a special counsel to head the Justice Department's Russia investigation. It may be the one card he can play to sidestep the growing frenzy that spins around him.

President Trump defended his actions on Wednesday, saying Mr Comey was fired ""because he was not doing a good job"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump was with Henry Kissinger when he told reporters James Comey was ""not doing a good job"" as FBI chief

Republicans and Democrats vowed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees' investigations into the Russia claims would continue.

The Senate Intelligence Committee moved forward by issuing a rare subpoena for documents from Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's former national security adviser, after he rejected its request to do so in April.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

It paid off with two 1,000-yard receiving seasons, touchdown salsa dances and a Super Bowl trophy before injuries took their toll and left Cruz in the position where he’s hoping to get another break from Coughlin, who is now the Jaguars’ president of football operations.

Coughlin seems willing to help, as he’s reportedly bringing Cruz in for a free-agent visit later this month.

The Jaguars are fairly set at wide receiver with Allen Robinson, Allen Hurns and Marqise Lee, but there may be room for a veteran hand such as Cruz if he can stay healthy. He missed only one game last season but played in just six total the previous two years. He made a name for himself with 82 catches for 1,536 yards in the Giants’ 2011 Super Bowl season before posting 1,092 and 998 receiving yards in the next two years before injuries hit and moved him down the depth chart.

16,Who coined 'prime the pump'? Definitely not Donald Trump,"The expression ""prime the pump"" has been used in economics since the Great Depression.

But President Trump claims he coined it the other day.

He bought it up in an interview with The Economist after he was asked whether his tax reform proposal might increase the federal deficit.

""We have to prime the pump,"" he said, meaning stimulate the economy.

""Have you heard that expression used before?,"" he continued. ""Because I haven't heard it. I mean, I just ... I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It's what you have to do.""

But the term is most often associated with 20th century economist John Maynard Keynes, a giant of the field and a favorite of liberals who favored government spending.

Keynes, generally thought of as the intellectual father of the New Deal, wrote and spoke of the need for government to spend money on projects during times of economic weakness to get the economy moving again.

Trump is also an advocate of spending on public works like highways and airports. But in this case he was advocating tax cuts to spur spending, and thus ""prime the pump"" to greater economic growth.

Related: Trump: I might release tax returns -- when I'm out of office

Merriam-Webster traces the phrase itself to Sir Walter Scott in 1819, though he wasn't talking about economics. The dictionary company, which has made a habit of fact-checking the president, corrected him Thursday.

The phrase 'priming the pump' dates to the early 19th century. — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) May 11, 2017

The economic sense dates to a Wall Street Journal article in 1933, according to Merriam-Webster. President Franklin D. Roosevelt used it in a 1937 speech.

Keynes did not actually use the term ""prime the pump"" or ""pump priming"" in his seminal work, ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money"" in 1936, but the term is widely associated with him nonetheless. Google lists more than 21,000 entries that include both his name and ""prime the pump.""

Related: Donald Trump thinks he invented the phrase 'priming the pump.' That's telling.

""Certainly, Keynes is associated with the idea, but it doesn't mean he used that exact phrase,"" said Peter Sokolowski, editor at large at Merriam-Webster.

For that matter, the phrase didn't first occur to Trump a couple of days ago.

""Sometimes you have to prime the pump,"" he told Time magazine in December, speaking of infrastructure spending and tax cuts. And he used the phrase three times in an interview with The New York Times Magazine in March, even stopping to make sure his interviewer got the drift.

""You know what I mean by 'prime the pump'?"" he said.

6,Will Supreme Court rescue Trump's immigration travel ban?,"Protesters marched in outside the federal appeals court in Richmond Monday during a hearing on President Trump's immigration travel ban. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)

WASHINGTON — As President Trump's effort to ban some travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries heads to yet another federal appeals court next week, the federal government's lawyers can't be blamed for looking further ahead — to the Supreme Court.

Nearly all the judges who have heard the administration claim the right to restrict immigration from countries it deems as security risks have said the travel ban discriminates against immigrants based on their religion. As proof, they have cited statements Trump made during the election campaign.

The 4th Circuit and 9th Circuit appeals courts now considering the case are likely to agree, based on their makeup — both have a majority of judges nominated by Democratic presidents. But the Supreme Court may be another story.

Chief Justice John Roberts is a strong proponent of executive authority, particularly in foreign affairs. Justice Samuel Alito has spent his entire career working for the government. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in a 2015 immigration case that a ""legitimate and bona fide"" reason for denying entry to the United States is sufficient. Justice Neil Gorsuch is a stickler for the written text of statutes — and banning Muslims isn't mentioned in Trump's executive order.

""The court is also generally reluctant, and the conservatives more so, to invalidate a facially valid act because it was done for a bad motive,"" says Douglas Laycock, an expert on religious liberty at the University of Virginia Law School. ""I would expect them to be especially reluctant to question a president’s motives on the basis of his campaign statements and the statements of unpaid advisers.""

Trump's chances of winning in court have been improved following an overall rewrite of his first executive order. Now it exempts thousands of foreign nationals who hold valid visas or green cards. It eliminates Iraq from the original list of affected countries, leaving Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It lasts for 90 days, not indefinitely, as had been the case for Syria. It contains no preference for religious minorities, while the original had favored Christians. And it includes a waiver process for those claiming undue hardship.

Still, last Monday's two-hour hearing before 13 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit sounded grim for the administration. And next Monday's oral argument before a three-judge 9th Circuit panel may not go much better. That makes it likely the government will appeal to the Supreme Court.

Protests like this one outside Monday's travel ban hearing in Richmond are likely to be much larger if the case gets to the Supreme Court. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)

It's not clear when, or even if, the court would hear the case. If the appeals courts are in agreement, the high court could stay out of it. If four justices vote to hear it — the required number — it likely would await an early fall oral argument. And the longer it takes, the harder it may be for the government to claim any irreparable harm, which hurts its argument that a 90-day hiatus would help.

“The odds for the government are much better before the Supreme Court,"" says Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor with expertise in national security. But he says, ""I don't think it's obvious at all that he wins 5-4.""

Read more:

Vladeck says Justice Clarence Thomas could be a sticking point, though he generally is the most conservative member of the court. He has written in the past that the First Amendment's prohibition on government-established religion is not so much an individual right as it is a constraint on the federal government. If so, he could rule the ban unconstitutional even though it mostly affects foreigners without constitutional rights.

And Kennedy's vote is by no means assured. His 2015 opinion leaves him room to decide that the travel ban's stated aim — protecting against potential terrorism — isn't a ""bona fide"" reason because of Trump's previously stated intention to ban Muslims.

But if the bona fide standard is met, he wrote, ""courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the constitutional interests of citizens."" He added, ""this reasoning has particular force in the area of national security.""

Then there's the matter of Kennedy's potential retirement. Many of his former clerks say he is considering whether to leave the court this year, at age 80, or stay on at least one more year. Most of the judges on Trump's list of potential replacements likely would support the ban, just as many analysts expect Gorsuch to do.

“He is the last jurist that I would expect to even entertain the notion that this is a Muslim ban,"" says Jonathan Turley, a constitutional scholar at George Washington University Law School. ""If the order is not expressly a ban on Muslims, he’s unlikely to treat it that way.”

In the end, Laycock says, ""the ultimate question in this case — which no judge will mention but every judge is thinking about — is whether this president gets the same deference as all other presidents.""

That will depend on how the courts balance Trump's words against his actions. Says Turley: “Few justices relish the idea of venturing into the mind of Donald Trump.”

9,5 reasons the Washington Capitals were eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins (again) | FOX Sports,"The stars

Have we seen Alex Ovechkin play his final game in a Capitals uniform? It seems a bit crazy to think about but it's not entirely out of the question.

That's thanks, in large part, to the way that he played in this series. Ovechkin fell out of favor with head coach Barry Trotz and was dropped from the top line to the third line following Game 4 in favor of Andre Burakovsky. Burakovsky played well to start the series and immediately took advantage of his increased role on the first line.

Ovechkin, however, scored just twice in the series and didn't show up like the Capitals needed him to or like you'd expect one of the greatest pure scorers of this generation to.

Ovechkin was especially bad in Game 7, when he was on the ice for both Penguins goals and was partially at fault for both of them.

On the first, Ovechkin was caught puck-watching and didn't backcheck in time to put a body on eventual goal-scorer Bryan Rust following a turnover. On the second, Ovechkin had a failed, lazy zone clear attempt that allowed the Penguins to regain possession and go up 2-0. These two defensive failures clearly didn't sit well with Trotz, who said, ""emotionally,"" he didn't want to comment on Ovi's performance following Game 7. (We'll get to that later.)

T.J. Oshie was another star winger that had a disappointing showing for Washington. He scored just once in the series and flubbed a golden chance that would have tied the game in the series finale.

On the flip side, the Penguins got strong performances from their star forwards. Evgeni Malkin was great, tallying seven points in seven games. Despite missing nearly two full games in the series, Sidney Crosby had seven points as well. Phil Kessel added three goals and five points. But it was emerging youngster Jake Guentzel who topped all Pens players in points, finishing with eight in the series.

The Capitals may have looked better on paper, but it was the Pittsburgh's headliners who were better about getting out there and making a difference on the ice.",fox-sports

A Justice Department official confirmed the meeting, but did not specify the topic. Dana Boente, the acting director of DOJ's national security division, is also present.

Senate intelligence chairman Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and vice chairman Mark Warner, D-Virginia, both left a hearing with acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe for the meeting.

Rosenstein wrote a memo that the White House has used as justification for firing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday. But he has also expressed frustration at how the White House handled the Comey dismissal, and using his reputation as cover for how it was done, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.

Vice President Mike Pence and deputy White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday repeatedly cited Rosenstein's memo on Comey recommending the FBI director's removal, leveraging his reputation and bipartisan Senate confirmation vote.

Like I said, it wasn't just Getzlaf producing in this series. The rest of Anaheim's top-six forwards pulled their weight as well.

And thank goodness they did, because the Ducks didn't get much from the bottom end of their roster in this series.

Of the Ducks' 21 goals in this series, 17 of them came from top-six forwards. That's 81 percent of their goals. The bottom six added three tallies, and just one came from the blue line.

Jakob Silfverberg was excellent, scoring five goals and adding three assists. Rickard Rakell also found the back of the net four times. Ryan Kesler had six points while shadowing Connor McDavid. Corey Perry had five assists and was active around the net. Perry may have only picked up one goal in this series, but it was a huge one — the game winner in Game 5's emotional overtime thriller.

6,Hepatitis C infections tripled in five years,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share You’ve likely heard of hepatitis C, a disease intravenous drug users have contracted from using needles unsafely. But hepatitis is much more complex. Time

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say testing for Hepatitis C is so limited. Confirmed cases may be less than a tenth of actual ones. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Injection opioid use among young people was the biggest contributor to a near tripling of new hepatitis C infections between 2010 to 2015, federal data out Thursday show,

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said confirmed hepatitis C cases rose from 850 in 2010 to 2,436 in 2015. The disease has few symptoms and testing is so limited, however, that CDC estimates about 34,000 people had hepatitis C in 2015.

Nearly 20,000 U. S. deaths in 2015 were attributable to hepatitis C,

The hepatitis C virus causes inflammation of the liver. If left untreated, it can cause liver cancer or scarring of the liver. It can lead to liver failure. Acute hepatitis C, which begins within six months of exposure, can move into a long-lasting stage, chronic hepatitis C.

The trend isn't only destroying families, it's devastating state health care budgets. Sky high hepatitis C drug costs have led states to restrict coverage of drugs to treat it. Free needle exchanges, which minimize the sharing of needles that transmit the disease, also face challenges with funding and opposition among those who believe it encourages drug use.

Louisiana health secretary Rebekah Gee is exploring ways to obtain a generic form of a drug to fight hepatitis C to treat the 73,000 people in her state who now have the disease. At current prices, her state's Medicaid program can only afford to treat about 300 patients a year.

""The harm that it will cause to not be able to treat this disease is only going to multiply the longer we wait,"" Gee said Thursday.

The national trend has alarming effects in already-struggling parts of the United States. Last summer, CDC reported that widespread drug abuse led hepatitis C diagnoses in young women to rise nearly 10 times faster in Kentucky than across the country.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share What is hepatitis C? It’s a viral infection that can be fatal, without treatment. And it’s rampant in the Greater Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky area. But treatment costs around $80,000. Terry DeMio

Meanwhile in that state, the proportion of babies born to infected moms surged 124% to one in 63.

Daniel Raymond, policy director for the national Harm Reduction Coalition, said the best way to stop the spread of hepatitis C is through needle exchange programs. That’s because hepatitis C is commonly spread when injection drug users share their needles and other equipment. In addition, people who are pricked with discarded, contaminated needles or emergency responders who are poked can get the disease.

“Needle exchange is our first line of defense against the spread of hepatitis C and HIV among people who inject,” Raymond said. “It’s also our best on-ramp to healthcare and treatment for this population.”

But even Raymond is concerned about the rampant spread of the disease.

“Nobody can say that the warning signs weren’t there,” he said, “but the big question is, can the start-up and set-up of syringe exchange programs outpace the spread of hepatitis C?”

In general, Raymond said he’s seeing greater acceptance of needle exchange in some states, including Kentucky, North Carolina and West Virginia. But, he said, “I think there’s a broader sense of urgency that’s missing.”

The Northern Kentucky Health Department has one syringe access program, at its rural Grant County health clinic site. The effort to provide more exchanges has stalled in the more populated Campbell, Boone and Kenton counties. Hepatitis C rates continue to rise, even since 2014, when Northern Kentucky’s rate beat the nation’s by nearly 20 percentage points.

Dr. Lynne Saddler, district director of the Northern Kentucky Health Department, noted that the region is seeing hepatitis C primarily in young adults, with the biggest age range for infection being 25 to 34.

""Actions to reverse these trends must be intensified. We need to continue to improve access to testing and treatment for hepatitis C,” Saddler said. “We need to educate people about risk factors, and be permitted to offer programs, like syringe exchange, to reduce the transmission of this disease.”

New hepatitis C virus infections are increasing fastest among young people, with the highest overall number of new infections among those 20 to 29 years old.

It's baby boomers who are the hardest hit by the disease, however. About 75% of the 3.5 million Americans already living with hepatitis C were born between 1945 and 1965. The increase young people is also putting their babies at risk.

Hepatitis C treatment not only cures the vast majority of people living with the virus, but also prevents transmission to their partners and children. That presents a strong economic argument for paying the price of current treatments, says former Obama administration health official Jonathan Gruber,

""How can we afford not to save people's lives at $84,000?"" says Gruber, now an economics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""If you can’t afford to give a drug that saves their life, what is health care for?""

State Medicaid budgets are already straining to meet rising health costs and additional enrollees, even in states such as Georgia that didn't expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Gee says she been forced to cut most mental health treatment services in the Medicaid program.

""I can’t spent the $760 million (drug makers) Gilead and Merck want to charge me,"" said Gee. ""We just can’t do it.""

During his court appearance, Hilton was seen making angry faces and mouthing at someone off camera.

Hotel heir Conrad Hilton, younger brother of Paris Hilton, has been released on bail after his arrest on grand theft auto and violating a restraining order, but his strange behavior in court helped send him to a psychiatric hospital.

Hilton, 23, was supposed to be arraigned on Wednesday after he was arrested in the Hollywood Hills on May 6 for allegedly violating an ex-girlfriend's restraining order and stealing her father's Bentley. He had been in the Los Angeles County jail since his arrest.

But when he was brought into court on Wednesday, clad in a jail outfit designed to prevent self-harm, Hilton seemed agitated and disturbed, according to an Associated Press video from the courtroom camera pool in Los Angeles Superior Court.

His attorney, celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro, tried to block the camera's view of his client and the microphone did not pick up everything Hilton said, but reporters in the courtroom heard several outbursts from him, including a homophobic slur, according to TMZ and E! Online. Hilton also winked at the court camera.

Shapiro declined to comment in an email to USA TODAY on Thursday.

The judge is heard telling Hilton his arraignment is postponed until June 29 and he will be released on $90,000 bail to the custody his father, Rick Hilton, who was in the courtroom with his wife, Kathy, and another son, Barron.

But Conrad Hilton was directed to check into a psychiatric clinic as a condition of his release, on the video. If he leaves the clinic before his June 29 court date, he'd be taken back into custody, the judge is heard warning him. TMZ and E! Online reported Hilton was going to The Menninger Clinic in Houston.

When Hilton is asked if he understands what's happening to him, he responded, ""Yes, your honor...I'm sorry for disrespecting this entire courtroom and this state and I didn't have sex with hookers,"" according to the video.

This is the latest incident in the troubled socialite's history of run-ins with the law. In 2015, he agreed to plead guilty to assaulting flight attendants on a July 2014 flight from London to Los Angeles during which authorities say he called other passengers ""peasants"" and threatened to kill crew members. He was sentenced to 750 hours of community services and three years of probation.

Later in 2015, Hilton turned himself into police in Riverside County, Calif., after he allegedly led police on a high-speed chase before crashing near Palm Springs in August 2014. Hilton suffered serious injuries and firefighters had to extract him from his BMW.

Vice President Pence said Thursday that the reign of terror carried out by the Islamic State militant group should be labeled ""genocide"" against Christians.

""I believe that ISIS is guilty of nothing short of genocide against people of the Christian faith, and it is time for the world to call it by name,"" Pence said at a speech to the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians, hosted by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.

""In Iraq at the hands of extremists, we have actually seen monasteries demolished, priests and monks beheaded, and the two-millennia-old Christian tradition in Mosul virtually extinguished overnight,"" Pence said. ""In Syria, we see ancient communities burned to the ground, we see believers tortured for confessing Christ and women and children sold into the most terrible form of human slavery.""

Pence said that radical Islamic terror groups also persecute members of other non-Christian faiths and even Muslims who do not share their version of Islam.

But ""the practitioners of terror harbor a special hatred for the followers of Christ, and none more so than the barbarians known as ISIS,"" he said.

""Know today with assurance that President Trump sees these crimes for what they are: vile acts of persecution animated by hatred for the gospel of Christ,"" he said.

Pence also promised that the Trump administration will act to protect religions freedom — for both Christians and non-Christians — around the world.

""Since the founding of our nation, America has stood for the proposition that the right to believe and the right to act on one's beliefs is the right of all people at all times,"" the vice president said. ""Protecting and promoting religious freedom is a foreign policy priority of the Trump administration.

Trump has been criticized for his willingness to embrace dictators who abuse human rights, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Coptic Christians in Egypt have long been persecuted, and in April, ISIS claimed credit for bombing two Coptic Christian churches in the country.

The Rev. Franklin Graham, who organized the summit to bring attention to Christians persecuted worldwide, shrugged off that criticism in an interview. ""We are a democracy but not all the world is going to be able to embrace democracy. You just have to deal with the leaders who are there and work with them,"" Graham said.

""You want to try to persuade leaders that have a different opinion,"" Graham said. ""You want to try to persuade them to your point of view."" Trump, Graham said, may be uniquely able to pursue that kind of persuasion because of his skills as a communicator and a negotiator.

WASHINGTON – President Trump said Thursday he planned to fire FBI Director James Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt.

That contradicts the White House's assertions – and a termination letter Trump sent Comey – that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

In a letter released by the White House, the Justice Department's leadership excoriated Comey's handling of the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, in particular, his unusual decision to hold a press conference in July announcing he would not charge the Democratic candidate – only to later publicly reopen the probe just 11 days before the November election.

Trump and his aides are scrambling to get past the furor over his dismissal of the FBI director who headed up an investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election.

Democrats have already decried the timing of Comey's firing as a way to short-circuit the ongoing counterintelligence probe. Yet Trump told NBC that ""there's no good time"" to fire an FBI director.

Trump also repeated his claim that Comey told him – three times – he was not under investigation. Those conversations, he said, took place twice over the phone, and once at a dinner that the president said Comey requested so that he could argue to keep his job.

“I actually asked him,"" Trump said. ""I said, 'If it's possible would you let me know am I under investigation?' (Comey) said, `You are not under investigation.'""

But Andrew McCabe, the acting FBI director, would not confirm those assurances to a Senate hearing earlier on Thursday. McCabe said he was not in a position to comment on whether such communications occurred, but when pressed, added that FBI leaders outlining the scope of ongoing investigations would not be ""standard practice.""

In the interview, Trump went on to attack Comey personally, using terms not usually lobbed at senior law enforcement officials. Trump described Comey as a ""show boat"" and a ""grandstander"" who led the FBI into ""turmoil."" The White House has maintained Comey lost the confidence of the bureau after his handling of the Clinton probe.

McCabe, however, told Congress that Comey enjoyed broad support within the ranks of the FBI before his dismissal.

“The vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,” McCabe told the Senate intelligence committee. Agents' support for the former director continues ""to this day,"" he added.

9,Take a tour of Ford Performance's state-of-the-art Tech Trailer | FOX Sports,"NASCAR is an ever-changing sport, and with a constant look toward the future comes a variety of technological enhancements.

In 2017, Ford Performance has advanced how they communicate as a company with their state-of-the-art Tech Trailer, which serves as the at-track headquarters as a resource and data hub for Blue Oval teams each race weekend.

The Tech Trailer helps Ford teams receive the latest information from practice, qualifying and the race by providing an incredibly faster method of data delivery.

Ford has gone to Victory Lane in the Monster Energy Series on five occasions so far this season, including Ricky Stenhouse Jr.’s first career Cup win at Talladega Superspeedway.

“I would say that technology is here as much as any other form of motorsports, maybe in a different way, but the amount of engineering that goes into these cars, the amount of data, and the amount of analysis that is used grows more and more every day, and it takes a lot to keep up with it and stay ahead,” said Mark Rushbrook, Ford Performance Motorsports Engineering Manager.

Before the Tech Trailer that debuted last October at Dover International Speedway, Travis Geisler, Team Penske’s NASCAR competition director, says that communication was certainly an issue.

“I can tell you before the trailer was there the struggle that we had with networks and sharing information, getting the technology that’s available into the hands of the guys who actually need to apply it and make the car better, was really a battle for us,” Geisler admitted. “This is something that everybody discussed as a priority. Ford stepped up and made the Tech Trailer happen and it’s something that we’re able to realize the gains from every weekend.”

During a recent interview with FOXSports.com, Tony Gibson, crew chief for Kurt Busch and the 2017 Daytona 500-winning No. 41 Stewart-Haas Racing team, indicated just how much emphasis Ford Performance puts on them to work together as one manufacturer.

“Ford Performance does a really good job of making us work together and be one big group of racers,” Gibson said. “We’ve never really had that before with other manufacturers, so it’s really nice to have a company like Ford Performance to help guide us and make us feel more friendly to one another.”

“It happens quite often,” said homeowner Shakun Chandhok, who called a plumber after a servant used a stick to drive off the monkeys. “They used to jump into the balcony and come into the kitchen and open the fridge, just like any human being does.”

The orange or gray monkeys, which weigh 12 to 17 pounds, have become one of the most dreaded pests in India, biting around 1,000 people a day nationwide and overrunning cities like New Delhi. The monkey problem has become so overwhelming that officials are searching for ways to use birth control on the animals.

In the fruit-growing state of Himachal Pradesh, monkeys have increased more than fivefold in the past decade, according the government. The animals create up to $300 million in crop losses and diverted labor every year, the farmer’s group Kheti Bachao Andolan said.

“Wherever they go, panic spreads,” said primatologist Iqbal Malik, who runs a nonprofit called Vatavaran, which is Hindi for environment. “Residents warn each other to close all doors and windows. Any houses which get raided by monkeys (are left) in shambles — eatables on the floor, crockery broken, taps open, wires cut, plants mauled.”

Himachal Pradesh formed a task force this month to cull the animals, which officials recently declared vermin. In the neighboring state of Uttarakhand, scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India will test an injectable contraceptive that has been used on white-tailed deer and wild horses in the United States.

“What our simulation and modeling indicate is that we need to control reproduction by more than 70% of the adult female population for a very long time, eight to 10 years,” to seriously impact monkey populations, said Qamar Qureshi, a senior scientist at the Wildlife Institute involved with the injectable contraceptives program.

City and state governments have tried numerous methods to control the monkey troubles. Since the monkeys are associated with the Hindu god Hanuman, mass culling has never been attempted. Officials have tried surgical sterilization. They’ve also employed monkey trainers to bring in tame langurs — a larger, more dominant species — to scare off the macaques.

Delhi officials even hired people to impersonate langurs to keep rogue macaques out of parliament. But the impersonators couldn’t keep them out of the building for long.

Himachal Pradesh spent around $1 million to set up eight sterilization centers. Officials pay trappers a bonus of nearly $10 a head for capturing the animals. Over the past 10 years, the state has sterilized more than 125,000 monkeys.

The cost and difficulty of sterilization has prompted persistent calls for trying oral contraceptives, a proposal first suggested in 2013. Qureshi said that plan failed because it's difficult to ensure the female monkeys consume the correct dosage, plus concerns that the drugs might hurt other species.

“Using oral contraceptives is a far-fetched dream at present,” he said. “It’s very difficult to implement in the field. We’re not talking about zoo conditions, where you can feed monkeys in controlled conditions.”

Injections are more practical, and in theory could be administered more quickly, but still present challenges. A single dose lasts only one year, and after that booster shots are necessary. At nearly $100 a dose, that's too costly for widespread use in the United States, let alone in India.

Surgical sterilization is much cheaper, easier to monitor and permanent, said Mewa Singh, a primatologist at the University of Mysore. But catching and releasing the monkeys is also costly.

Adding to the multiplying monkey population in urban centers from New Delhi in the north to Chennai in the south: People feed them at temples and parks, believing them to be holy.

“In South India, we’ve been monitoring the (macaque) population for the past 25 years,” he said. “The population has come down by 66%. But the complaint is the same. There are hundreds of thousands of monkeys, and they’re damaging the crops.”

9,John Wall surprised by Celtics’ fans vulgar chant directed at Kelly Oubre Jr. | FOX Sports,"Washington Wizards forward Kelly Oubre Jr. assumed Celtics fans would let him hear it for his altercation with Kelly Olynyk earlier in the series, but what Boston fans had in store for Oubre was so vulgar that it caught Wizards star John Wall off guard Wednesday night.

Fans at TD Garden initially chanted “We want Oubre!” but the crowd changed its tune later in the game, screaming “[Expletive] you, Oubre!” loud enough that it could be heard on the TNT broadcast.

Wall said after the Celtics’ 123-101 win that the vulgarity took him by surprise.

“We told [Oubre] what to expect from the crowd. We didn’t think it would be those type of words,” Wall told reporters, via ESPN. “But all you can do is go out there and play basketball. We’re his brothers. We stick behind him.”

Oubre was given a one-game suspension after he leveled Olynyk for setting an illegal screen in Game 3. Oubre tried to downplay what he heard from the fans Wednesday.

“Um, I still hear my name ringing in my head because that’s all I heard when I was on the court, but I was just going out there to play,” Oubre told reporters, via The Washington Post.

Oubre finished with 13 points on 5-of-10 shooting in 20 minutes Wednesday night. The Wizards hope to extend the series, which is heading back to Washington with the Celtics up 3-2.",fox-sports
9,"The Capitals and Alex Ovechkin are hapless losers, but don't call them chokers (maybe) | FOX Sports","Alex Ovechkin didn’t trip on his shoelaces. He didn’t whiff on shots or pull a McNabb on the blue line. His Washington Capitals didn’t get embarrassed or booed off the ice (though the former might have been deserved) at the end of Wednesday’s inevitable Game 7 home loss to the perennial Caps-killing Pittsburgh Penguins.

Maybe they did choke under the weight of three decades of postseason failure. Or maybe the story behind the latest and greatest playoff collapse for the NHL’s most underachieving franchise was far less grandiose: shoddy goaltending and how-did-that-miss offensive opportunities, including Ovechkin’s own sweet-spot slap shot that was destined for the back of the net until it somehow got deflected by the shaft of Marc-André Fleury’s stick.

No matter. Reasons and rationality are irrelevant in a time like this. The Caps choked. Ovi isn’t clutch. Blow ’em up.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports

In zero-sum games, that’s the easy and obvious reaction. Forget that with a few different bounces of the puck, the Washington Capitals advance to the Eastern Conference Finals and are favored to win the Stanley Cup. The Ovechkin referendum and talk of blowing up the team become a distant memory. They’ve gotten over the hump and all the misery is behind them.

Except that it’s not and now the franchise and its Hall of Famer player are in crisis, all because they got outscored in the final 32 minutes of its season. Just like that. Less than 24 hours ago, the sky was the limit for the Washington Capitals. Now, the limit has been firmly established as the Eastern Conference Semifinals and it might take a complete teardown to move the line.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports

It’s certainly possible, even plausible, the Caps choked it away like they have so many times before – collapsing under the weight of the ghosts of the Easter Epic, Pittsburgh blowouts and the dozen other bad playoff losses. It’s not like we’d ever know. You can’t blindly assign labels based on results, not when those results can be so arbitrary. Win and the Caps conquered decades of turmoil. Lose and it’s a total collapse. No in between. No room for nuance.

The “choke” or “clutch” idea exists merely as confirmation bias, added after the fact. They lost, so they choked. But did they? Just because the final score read 2-0, we don’t know their muscles were tight or that they overthought every scoring opportunity. Are you sure the pressure affected how they set up the power play or if Braden Holtby’s rough night was due to nerves instead of simply having an ill-timed off night?

What is a choke? Nerves failing you at the biggest moment. What is clutch? Coming through in that moment. Both are nebulous, indefinable concepts that no number can capture or declare. There’s no stat that reveals an athlete’s ability to come through when the situation is the toughest. They’re both feelings that lead to actions. A clutch athlete lives for the pressure situation and revels in the excitement around it. They excel when the only other option is defeat – think Tiger Woods, Tom Brady, David Ortiz and Serena Williams.

Of course, there’s no way to know for sure. Maybe those athlete are puddles of nerves in the big moments and somehow they come through anyway. They’re certainly talented enough to compensate for it. Maybe, but it doubt it. When Tiger hit that putt on No. 18 in the 2008 U.S. Open, NBC’s Dan Hicks shouted “expect anything different?” and no one did. When Brady led the Patriots on a game-winning touchdown on the first drive of overtime in the Super Bowl, it felt predestined. When Serena is down a set and a break and all looks lost, that’s when she seems to play her best.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports

But because being clutch is still subject to the percentages and expected failures in sports, there’s no legitimate way to definitively place such a label on an athlete. Even if Ortiz was the most clutch player in baseball history, he’d still get out half the time in big spots. Brady lost two Super Bowls in the final minutes. Serena has dropped two of her last four Grand Slam finals. And Tiger is showing that clutch can only go so far; without the talent to back it up it’s a worthless trait.

Then there’s the flip side. Those deemed chokers can still succeed too. You can drill a birdie putt on the 18th hole of the Masters. (It’s how Phil Mickelson won his first major.) There are still Super Bowls to win even if your performances in the biggest games aren’t up to your usual standards. (Peyton Manning has two rings.) The Stanley Cup is attainable even if you do your best to give it away (about halfway through Game 7, the Caps and Penguins were tied – it’s not hard to imagine a scenario where one of the Caps shots got past Fleury and today we’re talking about Ovechkin being close to cementing his legacy). You can overcome shaky nerves and fail with steely ones.

None of these things are mutually exclusive. In sports, where series, careers and reputations can hinge on missing a pitch by a half-inch, being slightly out of position on a power-play pass or letting one stray thought creep into your mind when the ball is in the air for a serve, the little things can be the difference between turning the Washington Capitals from a Stanley Cup favorite to a team many agree is in need of a complete demolition in a matter of two-and-a-half hours.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Amber Searls-USA TODAY Sports

Ovechkin isn’t deserving of all the blame but shouldn’t be absolved of it either. Okay, he averages more points both in elimination games and in the playoffs against the Penguins than he does in the regular season. Great. I can play numbers too. Ovechkin’s teams have a playoff winning percentage that’s vastly worse than their regular-season winning percentage. Here’s another: No player with as many MVP awards has ever failed to win a Stanley Cup. And not only has Ovi failed to hoist the Cup, he hasn’t even come within eight wins of it, as his Caps have never advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. Which one matters more?

So call him what you want. Superstar. Choker. MVP. Disappointment. Victim of circumstance. There’s only one title that matters for Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals: Playoff losers, yet again.",fox-sports
9,Cardinals release former Pro Bowl LB Daryl Washington after his reinstatement | FOX Sports,"Former Pro Bowl linebacker Daryl Washington was reinstated by the league last month, more than three years after he played his last NFL game for the Arizona Cardinals, but the team released him Thursday.

We have released LB Daryl Washington. More info: https://t.co/pv1wdhqP3N pic.twitter.com/MBMq0G1yOI — Arizona Cardinals (@AZCardinals) May 11, 2017

Washington, 30, was suspended multiple times for violating the league’s substance abuse policy and had legal problems, too, serving 10 months of probation in 2014 for assaulting his former girlfriend.

On Monday, the Cardinals met with Washington for the first time since his suspension. At one time, he was one of the most dynamic inside linebackers in the league, racking up nine sacks during his 2012 Pro Bowl season. But Cardinals president and owner Michael Bidwell told SiriusXM’s Mad Dog Sports Radio this week that he wanted to know where he was at off the field.

“This is the first time we’ve dealt with a situation like this. I will speak generally: We need to know that this isn’t going to happen again, that he’s accepted responsibility for what happened and what he had done. … professionally that they’re going to be good to go moving forward and that we’re comfortable having him around.”

Washington said all the right things in his statement after being reinstated, but apparently it wasn’t enough.

“I’m honored and humbled to be back in the National Football League,” the linebacker said in an April statement. “These last three years have been the most difficult of my life without the game I love so much. That said, I’ve used this time to make tremendous strides as a man and have grown into a proud husband, father and contributing member of my community.

“Physically I’m in the best shape of my life and have maintained a strenuous six-day-per-week workout plan for over a year in anticipation of this day and next season. I understand the physical and mental demands that it takes to be an All-Pro linebacker in this league, and I fully intend to play at that level this season.”

9,Demian Maia doesn't have 'any doubt' that a win at UFC 211 should earn him a title shot | FOX Sports,"DALLAS — By all accounts, Demian Maia should already be fighting for the UFC welterweight title.

The veteran submission specialist has won six fights in a row including a lopsided victory over Gunnar Nelson as well as tapping out former interim champion Carlos Condit as well as Matt Brown in recent performances.

Still, Maia hasn’t earned his shot at the gold and instead he’s facing a very tough opponent this weekend at UFC 211 when he takes on Jorge Masvidal in Dallas.

Admittedly, Maia was a little frustrated that he had to fight yet another top ranked welterweight rather than earning his title shot, but he couldn’t deviate his focus or risk Masvidal getting a win over him.

“At first of course [I was disappointed] but after I said OK, let’s fight so I just cleared my mind and that’s the fight,” Maia told FOX Sports on Wednesday. “Like every other fight, it’s the most important fight of my life. Every fight is the most important fight of your life.”

Maia knows that Masvidal offers an interesting opposition with his fast hands, dangerous boxing and quick takedown defense.

Current welterweight champion Tyron Woodley has even commented that Masvidal’s style could present a lot of problems for Maia’s grappling heavy game where he attempts to drag his opponents to the mat before applying his world class Brazilian jiu-jitsu arsenal.

Still, Maia is just as confident now against Masvidal as he’s been in all his recent fights because he knows he doesn’t need much time with any opponent on the ground to show why he’s arguably the most dangerous submission artist in the UFC.

“Every fight of course is different but pretty much he’s a very good striker with takedown defense. At this level, everybody’s like that. Almost every fight that I have fought, they were really good strikers with takedown defense,” Maia said about Masvidal “So I don’t think it’s different but I just feel when you get inside the Octagon, you’re really going to feel your opponent.

“My goal is to [submit him]. My mindset is to do that. Of course, he’s a really tough opponent, very well rounded, very good boxer, but in my mind I want to go in there and do the same as the last fights.”

Maia understands there are no guarantees that a title shot will await him with a win on Saturday night, but he also knows there’s no logic against him challenging for the belt if he gets past Masvidal at UFC 211.

“I don’t have any doubt about that,” Maia said about getting his title shot with a win over Masvidal.

Ottawa Fury were up 1-0 on FC Edmonton in the Canadian Championship when goalkeeper Callum Irving decided to make things a little bit interesting for his team:

It’s the OLDEST trick in the striker handbook. Hang out, wait until the unsuspecting keeper rolls the ball out, and voila. Easy goal.

It’s so simple to execute, and it’s even easier to prevent. All it takes is a little look over the shoulder, just a quick confirmation that “hey, there’s not a guy waiting to make me look stupid back there. Clear for takeoff.”

But no. It seems that in the year of our lord two thousand and seventeen, this is still happening. Luckily for Ottawa, they got two more goals, winning 3-2 on the day, so everything worked out. This just serves as a lesson for all the young goalkeepers out there.

US President Donald Trump has insisted he is not under investigation, as he dismissed the FBI director he fired as a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"".

Mr Trump also revealed to NBC News it was his decision to sack James Comey.

Mr Comey was leading an inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election and possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Moscow.

Mr Trump has dismissed the probe as a ""charade"", a claim directly contradicted by Mr Comey's successor.

In his first interview since firing the FBI director, Mr Trump told NBC News he had asked Mr Comey whether he was under investigation.

""I said, if it's possible would you let me know, 'Am I under investigation?' He said: 'You are not under investigation.'""

""I know I'm not under investigation,"" Mr Trump told the interviewer.

The president also appeared to undercut the initial White House explanation that he fired Mr Comey on the recommendation of top justice officials.

""He's a showboat. He's a grandstander. The FBI has been in turmoil. I was going to fire Comey. My decision,"" Mr Trump said.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.""

The White House has depicted the Russia inquiry as ""probably one of the smallest things"" that the FBI has ""got going on their plate"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump was with Henry Kissinger when he told reporters James Comey was ""not doing a good job"" as FBI chief

But acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said on Thursday that it was ""a highly significant investigation"".

In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, he also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of his staff.

""I can confidently tell you that the vast majority of employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,"" Mr McCabe said.

The acting FBI director vowed not to update the White House on the status of the investigation and to notify the Senate panel of any attempt to interfere with the inquiry.

Republican committee chairman Richard Burr asked Mr McCabe if he had ever heard Mr Comey tell Mr Trump the president was not the subject of investigation.

Mr McCabe said he could not comment on an ongoing inquiry.

There are reports the ex-FBI boss had asked for more resources to conduct the probe and Democrats in the US Senate have formally requested details from the Justice Department on any additional funding he requested.

Some Democratic senators say they believed the reports to be true; a Justice Department spokeswoman rejected them as ""totally false"".

Democrats are also calling for a special prosecutor to take over the Russia investigation.

In other developments:

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed""

The president is ""very likely"" to visit the FBI headquarters in the next few days, says the White House

Mr Comey reportedly refused to preview his Senate testimony to top Trump aides, Reuters reports

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was reportedly on the verge of resigning after the White House cast him as the prime catalyst for firing Mr Comey, US media reported.

He detailed Mr Comey's ""serious mistakes"" in a memo to President Trump, just prior to the firing.

Mr Rosenstein demanded the White House make clear the decision was the president's, according to US media.

""I'm not aware of his threatening to resign,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ABC's programme Good Morning America on Thursday.

Rosenstein's way out - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Rod Rosenstein brought a reputation for even-handedness and probity with him to the job of deputy attorney general. Two weeks later, that reputation is being put to the test.

Such is life in the Trump White House, where every appointee and aide is just one tweet, event or press conference away from the maelstrom.

On Tuesday night, as the administration press shop scrambled to explain the president's surprise decision to sack his FBI director, Trump supporters leaned hard on Mr Rosenstein's credentials to paint the move as a nonpartisan decision based on Mr Comey's overall job performance.

The deputy attorney general reportedly balked at the characterisation that he was the driving force behind Mr Comey's dismissal, however.

Mr Rosenstein's threat to resign is different than actually packing bags, of course, and his fate at this point is still tethered firmly to the president he chose to serve.

There is a way out, though. Due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal on the matter, it's Mr Rosenstein's call whether to appoint a special counsel to head the Justice Department's Russia investigation. It may be the one card he can play to sidestep the growing frenzy that spins around him.

Sticking up for Comey is actually the least politically expedient thing that McCabe could do

Washington (CNN) One of the main reasons that President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday night was because the rank-and-file workers at the bureau simply didn't like Comey and, more importantly, didn't feel like they could trust him.

That was the line of argument coming from the White House on Wednesday via deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

""The President, over the last several months, lost confidence in Director Comey,"" she said at the daily press briefing . ""The DOJ lost confidence in Director Comey. Bipartisan members of Congress made it clear that they had lost confidence in Director Comey. And, most importantly, the rank-and-file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director.""

Then, later, she added: ""We've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things. In fact, the President will be meeting with acting Director (Andrew) McCabe later today to discuss that very thing -- the morale at the FBI -- as well as make an offer to go directly to the FBI if he feels that that's necessary and appropriate.""

During an interview with NBC on Thursday, Trump doubled down on the idea that Comey wasn't liked within the FBI. ""He's a show boat, he's a grand stander, the FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that,"" Trump told Lester Holt.

LaVar Ball has a preordained message for Kobe Bryant: Mentoring his NBA-bound son, Lonzo, is unnecessary.

Never mind the fact that the five-time champion has mentored NBA stars Isaiah Thomas, Russell Westbrook and James Harden, to name a few.

“I don’t need no advice from Kobe Bryant.”

That’s the latest soundbite from basketball’s most polarizing father figure, adding to the long list of quotable statements that most recently included saying Michael Jordan is “not Lonzo Ball” when it came to selling his eye-popping $495 sneakers.

MORE NBA NEWS:

“I don’t need advice from Kobe Bryant. ‘Zo’s got to play his game,” LaVar said on ESPN Radio 710 LA.

""If they're at practice and he sees something, and Lonzo listens to him or whatever, he's good. ... But it's just not, 'OK, I'm talking to Kobe, so now I'm going to be good.' If Kobe sees something that 'Zo is doing, then go from there. But I'm not trying to pattern after nobody.""

Both LaVar and Lonzo have expressed interest in being drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers.

Bryant, who retired last season after an illustrious NBA career — all in Los Angeles — has said he’s an “open book” to Lakers and NBA players.

Yes, Bowman has dealt with injuries in the past three years, but the 49ers have little reason to trade their starting inside linebacker. Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch issued a joint statement denying the report, saying they’re looking forward to Bowman’s future contributions.

Bowman played just four games last season before tearing his Achilles, the second significant injury he’s suffered in the past three years. He hasn’t been the same player since tearing his ACL in January 2014, which forced him to miss all of the following season.

The 49ers did draft Reuben Foster, but he’ll be a running mate with Bowman, not a replacement. Having those two at inside linebacker will give the 49ers a formidable duo, which should improve their abysmal run defense from a year ago.

Not to mention, the 49ers have Bowman under contract through 2022 after signing him to a four-year extension last offseason. It seems pretty unlikely that the 49ers would trade their stud linebacker just one year into his contract.",fox-sports
6,Is Roger Stone making good on a 40-year-old grudge?,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book "" Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success "" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) Though many individuals likely contributed to the President's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, one notable one may have been Roger Stone, a 64-year-old close friend of Donald Trump and central figure in the FBI investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.

In the middle of the Watergate scandal, Stone, who engaged in dirty tricks during Richard Nixon's 1972 campaign, was discovered to have hired a Republican operative to infiltrate the George McGovern campaign and was subsequently fired from his job. After the President's resignation, Stone remained an ardent Nixon apologist and loyalist. He even had the man's face tattooed on his back and devoted his life to ruthless, anything-goes politics (or political consulting, as you may know it). Stone's motto was and continues to be: ""Admit nothing, deny everything, launch counterattack."" And anyone who has watched Trump closely over the years would think it was his personal slogan, too.

Stone was introduced to Trump in the 1980s by the notorious Roy Cohn. Then a Manhattan lawyer who represented several reputed mobsters, Cohn had become infamous in the 1950s as the chief inquisitor during Joe McCarthy's ""Red Scare"" hearings in the United States Senate. After McCarthy's inquisition was shut down, Cohn began a new life as a political and legal fixer. He became a mentor to Stone and Trump and taught both men how to manipulate the media and bully opponents. After he died, they carried on in his spirit.

In Cohn's absence, Stone became Trump's main adviser for many political efforts, beginning with a flirtation with a run for the White House in 1987 (Trump even gave a speech in New Hampshire). But as much as Trump may have appreciated Stone's extreme pugnaciousness, he also had his reservations. Stone traffics in conspiracy theories and misogyny (see his disgraceful comments about Hillary Clinton) and has repeatedly suggested that leading political figures should be killed or kill themselves.

In 2015, Trump called Stone a "" loser "" and made a show of separating himself from him. Then, in the spring of 2016, Trump seemed to embrace him again. ""Roger is never too far away from Trump,"" a source told Dylan Byers of CNN Politics. ""He's always talking to Donald."" Yet another source said, ""Roger and Trump always wind up finding their way back to each other.""

In the White House, Trump has continued to answer calls from old friends, and Stone seems to be among them. Days ago, the DailyCaller published a story with the headline, ""Roger Stone still talks with President Trump."" Reporter Kerry Picket wrote, ""Republican political operative Roger Stone says he still communicates with President Donald Trump, and the last conversation he had was relatively recent.""

Both CNN and Politico are now reporting that Stone has been among those urging Trump to fire Comey. And the President's longtime friend would have reason to want Comey fired. Stone is at the center of the controversy over Russia's attempt to influence the 2016 election -- after tweeting a message that predicted trouble for Clinton campaign official John Podesta, whose hacked emails were then published by WikiLeaks. Stone also hinted at an ""October surprise"" that would be devastating to Clinton and said he had communicated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

More recently, as he was subject to more scrutiny, Stone called the FBI probe into his activities "" a witch hunt ."" In taking on the FBI directly, Stone employed his longstanding strategy of always staying on the offensive. Operatives who use this method view every conflict as a matter of survival, which justifies the use of any weapon that might be at hand. Thus, an opponent can be labeled a criminal, and crowds can be exhorted with chants of ""lock her up."" No tactic is too low if you are fighting for your life.

Trump has adopted a similar approach to dealing with those who oppose him. His violent rhetoric about protesters -- ""I'd like to punch him in the face"" -- at his campaign stops and his indulgence of conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones of InfoWars, a radical right-wing radio show host, showed that he, too, was comfortable doing whatever was required to get what he wanted.

In addition to their aggression, Trump and Stone also share a preference for defying convention. One reliable way to do this involves making statements that are too shocking to believe. Thus, we have Stone responding to Comey's firing with the comment it's "" about time "" and then Trump taking to Twitter to say, ""Have not spoken to Roger in a long time -- had nothing to do with my decision."" Stone later took to Twitter as well, saying that while he hadn't ""urged"" the President to dismiss Comey, he supported his decision ""100%.""

Understanding this ruthless Stone/Trump approach makes it easier to recognize what may have happened with Comey. Since the FBI investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia was hitting close to home, both Trump and Stone stood to benefit from Comey's dismissal. And given their 30-year history of working together to further their objectives by any means necessary, this decision fits well within an existing paradigm.

With Comey's firing, we now have a new demonstration of the lengths to which these men will go to thwart their opponents. Under Stone's apparent influence, Trump has sacrificed the integrity of the presidency and thrown the nation into a political crisis that may eventually rival the one provoked by Nixon's abuse of presidential power. As CNN contributor Jeffrey Toobin noted, Stone subscribes to "" Nixonian hardball ,"" which includes using what others consider unethical methods in order to win.

He and Trump have brought this style of play back to the White House.",cnn
6,Donald Trump insisted Comey exonerated him. Not exactly...,"(CNN) President Donald Trump reiterated Thursday that deposed FBI director James Comey told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation for his campaign's ties to Russian intelligence officials.

""He told me that ... and I've heard that from others,"" Trump told NBC's Lester Holt.

The President added that Comey told him he was not under investigation once during a ""very nice dinner"" and two other times over the phone. That's consistent with the letter Trump sent Comey informing him that he had been fired; ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau,"" Trump wrote.

There have been a whole lot of reasons to be skeptical of Trump's assertion that Comey just kept telling him he was not being investigated.

1. The FBI investigation is focused in part, at the moment, on Trump campaign associates like former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former foreign policy aide Carter Page. ""At the moment"" is the key thing there. This is an ongoing investigation, meaning that the FBI continues to work on it. That Trump isn't currently under investigation doesn't necessarily, therefore, tell us as much as he wants us to think it tells us.

9,Anderson Silva officially out of UFC 212 in Brazil | FOX Sports,"Former middleweight champion Anderson Silva has officially been pulled from UFC 212 in Brazil on June 3.

Silva was expected to face former “Ultimate Fighter” winner Kelvin Gastelum on the card, but Gastelum was yanked from the matchup after he returned a positive drug test for marijuana following his last bout against Vitor Belfort in March.

Silva had previously announced earlier this week that he was bringing his training camp to an end with no new opponent on the horizon for the upcoming show in Rio de Janeiro.

UFC officials confirmed on Thursday that Silva will not stay on the card after no deal could be reached to find him a new opponent.

“Following the April 6 removal of Kelvin Gastelum from his UFC 212 bout against Anderson Silva, UFC officials attempted to find a replacement to meet Silva on June 3. However, an opponent was not secured to face the former middleweight champion on short notice, prompting his removal from the card at Jeunesse Arena in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,” UFC officials wrote in a statement on Thursday.

Silva last competed at UFC 208 in February where he earned a decision victory over Derek Brunson.

There’s no word yet on when Silva will fight again, although he had recently threatened that without an interim title on the line for his next bout, he may consider retirement.

UFC president Dana White quickly shot down that idea by saying no interim title would be introduced in the middleweight division.

It’s unclear at this time when or if Silva will be booked for his next matchup.",fox-sports
9,Carl Long cleared to compete in first Cup race since 2009 | FOX Sports,"One of the strangest stories ever in NASCAR has taken yet another surprising turn.

Carl Long, the owner/driver of a low-budget team in what is now the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, was kicked out of the Cup garage in 2009 because the engine in his car for the Sprint Showdown last-chance all-star qualifying race at Charlotte Motor Speedway was deemed by NASCAR officials to be 0.17 cubic inches too big.

Long was fined $200,000 for the offense, at the time the largest fine in NASCAR history.

Because Long was unable to repay the fine, he was banished from the Cup garage, although he was still permitted to race in the NASCAR XFINITY and Camping World Truck Series, which he did intermittently.

Long has not raced in the Cup Series since the oversized engine incident.

That may change this weekend.

NASCAR confirmed on Thursday that Long has cleared to race in the Cup Series. “We do know that he has satisfied all necessary requirements to compete,” a NASCAR representative told FOXSports.com.

Apparently, Long will attempt to enter Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway.

There is now a Carl Long Motorsports page on gofundme.com that states “Carl Long is trying to gather sponsorship to run in the upcoming Cup race in Kansas! It has been nine years since Carl has run in Cup. Can you help?” Click here to donate.

6,Trump orders 'voter fraud' commission as FBI firing fallout lingers,"President Trump boards Air Force One before his departure from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., on May 4, 2017. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)

WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to set up a commission to study his unproven allegations of voter fraud in last year's presidential election, as he continues to grapple with the fallout from his abrupt and controversial firing of FBI Director James Comey.

The commission will be chaired by Vice President Pence, who will be joined by up to 15 other members. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach will serve as the commission's vice chair, according to White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders.

""The Commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American people's confidence in the integrity of Federal elections — including improper registrations, improper voting, fraudulent registrations, fraudulent voting, and voting suppression,"" the White House said in a statement.

Trump, who lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 2.9 million votes, has claimed that last year's election included up to 3 million to 5 million fraudulent voters — but there is no evidence to back this assertion.

Trump's executive order creating the commission comes as Democrats and other critics accuse him of firing Comey to obstruct an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russians who tried to influence last year's election.

The president is planning a visit to the FBI headquarters in the coming days to calm the waters, administration officials said. But the unexpected announcement of the new commission — which was not on Trump's public schedule for the day — might be seen as a way to distract from the firestorm unleashed by the Comey firing earlier this week.

Meanwhile, federal and state election officials from both parties have disputed Trump's claims of massive voter fraud. They say there have been few, if any, incidents of people voting when they were not registered – or voting by people who were not American citizens.

""Every election is going to have issues, but I don’t think that three to five million people voting illegally was one of those issues,"" said Thomas Hicks, chairman of the federal Election Assistance Commission said in January in USA TODAY.

Election officials have said they worry Trump’s claims could shake the faith of voters, particularly at a time when the FBI and Congress are investigating whether Russia interfered in last year’s presidential election.

For his part, Trump has stood by his claim.

""We'll see after the committee,"" Trump told Time magazine in March.

Trump had originally been expected to sign the executive order creating the voter commission in late January, but it has been consistently been put off.

Already, voting rights advocates are blasting Thursday's expected order.

“In no uncertain terms we condemn the launch of this so-called Presidential Commission on Election Integrity,’’ Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement. “President Trump is trying to create a distraction from actual threats to our democracy, such as ongoing voter suppression and Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.’’

Voting rights advocates say the administration should focus on making access to the polls easier instead of unfounded claims of voter fraud. They argue some lawmakers are using the claim to ramp up more restrictive election laws.

States, mostly controlled by Republican legislatures, have adopted more election laws, including voter ID, in recent years. Supporters say they help protect against voter fraud.

Trump's order could get support from some Republican lawmakers, who have welcomed a federal investigation into allegations of voter fraud.

“Safeguarding our democracy requires fair and accurate elections,” Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., chairman of the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal elections, said earlier this year.

6,White House: Removing Comey will help bring Russia investigation to end,"Story highlights Trump fired Comey Tuesday

The FBI is investigating possible Trump campaign connections to Russia's election hacking

(CNN) The White House said Thursday that removing FBI Director James Comey from his post may hasten the agency's investigation into Russian meddling.

""We want this to come to its conclusion, we want it to come to its conclusion with integrity,"" said deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders, referring to the FBI's probe into Moscow's interference in last year's election. ""And we think that we've actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen.""

The statement was a surprising admission from the White House that Comey's sudden dismissal on Tuesday may have an effect on the Russia probe. Officials have insisted the removal came because of Comey's handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, and was unrelated to his oversight of the look into Russia's election hacking and possible ties between Trump advisers and Russian operatives.

Sanders said Thursday that Trump would ""love nothing more for this investigation to continue to its completion.""

But Trump himself has cast doubt on the investigation, suggesting any question of ties between his campaign and Russia are a ""hoax.""

6,Many Trump backers are 'totally OK' with Comey firing,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is under fire again, this time for his firing of former FBI Director James Comey . But many of his supporters aren't joining the outcry.

CNN spoke to voters across the country, most of them Trump backers, and while some of them expressed surprise at Comey's ouster, few said it changed their image of the leader of the free world.

Here's what they had to say:

Jake Lee, business owner

Lee, 46, of West Hollywood, California, said he believes Trump made ""the right decision"" in axing Comey.

""As far as the Comey thing goes, I think he gave him plenty of chances. I think what became the last straw was when he (Comey) made that statement about the classified emails showing up on (Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin's and her husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner's) laptop. You can't have rules for the elitist ruling class and not have those rules apply to everybody else. I think in my opinion that was part of (Trump's) decision. The guy likes to run a tight ship.""

As for concerns that Comey's firing could affect the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia, Lee doesn't see it as an issue.

""You know, I think (Trump's) a lot smarter than that. If he were to fire him and then later ... the news got out that he was actually involved with Russia -- which I don't believe so -- that would be even worse. The cover-up would be worse than the actual crime, and I don't think that he would put himself in that situation. The guy, in my opinion, is super smart.""

Willie Standley, clothing store owner

Standley, 53, of York, Pennsylvania, says he has no issue with Comey's firing, although he was surprised by it and wonders what effect his ouster will have on the investigation into Trump's Russia ties. He also thinks the matter has become entirely too political.

""I think we should take the politics out of it. Get a special investigation to go out there and get the truth to go ahead and serve America, not the politicians.

""When a person is in office they should have people around them that are going to go ahead and support what they stand for. I own my own business, and if someone went ahead and undermined me and my business, I would fire them too.""

Standley, however, would like to see a special investigation into the firing.

""There should be a special investigation. Trump is not right. Something is definitely not right because the timing and everything is not good. It's not good at all. Something smells with Trump. I don't have blind loyalty -- no way -- because ... I don't trust politicians. And that's part of why I voted for (Trump) because he wasn't a politician. But once he stepped in there doing the things that he's done ... he's going at it like a politician, not a businessman.""

So, after the ordeal, is Standley still happy he cast his vote for Trump?

""I would say it's early on, but no. But I still think he's going to be better than Hillary would have been. Time will tell. ... ""He is serving himself and not the people.""

Leo Palis, graphic designer

Palis, 59, of Miami, is a Hillary Clinton supporter and says Comey ""had it coming. ... I do believe Comey was the reason why Hillary lost the election. You can't blame the guy 100% but he was a major piece of that loss, so I don't feel any sympathy for the guy.

""If Trump said he was doing a bad job, maybe he was doing a good job because of all these Russian connections and who knows what was going on and is going on inside the White House. Sooner or later, it's going to explode. It's only a matter of time.

""The people of the United States will know what's going on with Russia. Russia has been the enemy since Day One, and the fact that (Trump) sympathizes with them from the beginning, it tells you something about what is going on. And he is a liar, so you can't trust him, and someone has to do the job. Comey was on it, but he got fired ... so hopefully it falls into someone else's hands who can finish up the job.""

Dane Roche, project manager

Roche, 25, of Greeley, Colorado, says he didn't vote for Trump so much as he voted against Clinton. Overall, he said, he's frustrated and feels the country is too divided -- and that the media is exacerbating that division.

As for the Comey firing, Roche said it was unexpected.

""I wouldn't say it's the best way to do it, but I don't get to choose. ... I was surprised but not surprised. Nothing surprises me anymore.""

Asked whether he still supports Trump, he said the Comey firing didn't move the needle for him, and he remains pleased that Clinton is not head of state.

""There are too many things going on right now. Politics are a s**t show.""

John Corry, real estate broker

Corry, of Chicago, said he might have been surprised by Comey's firing a couple of years ago, but not now.

""Nothing surprises me anymore, particularly after what just happened in the election. ... There is no normal or status quo anymore, as much as the Democrats and Republicans try and cram it down our throats.""

""The situation with Comey is interesting because if you go back seven months the Democrats wanted to lynch him. He had all these fireable offenses. ... ""Do I think he got a raw deal? Probably, but that's the nature of politics.""

The situation hasn't affected his opinion of Trump, although he does wonder why liberals don't see that their aversion to Trump is not so different from conservatives' feelings toward Barack Obama during his presidency.

""What's frustrating to me is that the left still doesn't get it, six months later. This isn't about Trump. It's about the vote. ... If you look at what happened with Obama, there was just as much pushback (to his actions), so the hypocrisy is right before everyone's eyes.""

""(Trump's) erratic and sophomoric at times ... but I'm supportive in regards to hoping that he is able to steer the country in a better direction fiscally and constitutionally. I'm hopeful.""

Evelio Medina, chamber president

Medina, 53, of Miami, is a big Trump supporter who helped organize the Deplorables Inauguration Ball in Washington D.C. earlier this year.

""I'm totally OK with the firing, not necessarily how it went down. I wish it had been a little more elegant,"" said the president and CEO of the Downtown Miami & Brickell Chamber of Commerce. ""Trump is unorthodox. I don't always have to agree with his form and fashion, but he's always gonna do it his way, just like the (Frank Sinatra) song.""

""It was essential to bring back the role of the FBI. (Comey) took liberties he never should have. ... He became political, and once you became political you can win and you can lose. Comey lost,"" he said. ""The Democrats haven't accepted that they lost the election. ... They hated Comey, and now they love Comey.""

Asked if he was concerned Comey's firing could have any affect on federal investigations into White House ties to Russia, Medina told CNN he feels the Russia issue is overblown.

""It became sexy all the sudden. I haven't seen any evidence of Russian collusion. Russia didn't pick me up, drive me to the polls and tell me which way to vote.""

Everett Stoner, retired meat cutter

Stoner, 80, is originally from Detroit but has lived in Greeley, Colorado, with his wife of 40 years for almost a decade. The Army veteran voted for Trump and thinks he's doing a good job, but he conceded no politician is perfect.

In regard to firing Comey, Trump was ""well within his rights and should've done it a long time ago. ... We need new blood."" He doesn't care for Comey because he thinks the former FBI director protected Clinton, which amounted, in his opinion, to Comey ""acting as a judge, not an investigator.""

He also appreciated the unexpected nature of Trump's announcement: ""Trump doesn't broadcast what he's gonna do; he just does it, and I like that.""

Bob Ruscoe, liquidator

Ruscoe, 57, of West Palm Beach, Florida, says he still feels in the dark about the Comey firing.

""There's a lot going on that I don't know about, so it's hard to make an opinion on something when you're only getting what they want us to know. I'm just like, 'Wow, sounds like how Washington works.' You know, there's a lot of stuff going on we'll never know about in history.""

As for the possible ramifications on the Russia investigation, Ruscoe said, ""I don't know what's going on. Stuff looks a whole lot different from where I'm looking at it then what it actually is ... I don't think we may ever know the actual truth.""",cnn

10,iPhone 8 leaked images show an all glass design,"This might be our best look yet at the iPhone 8 – or at least renders of it, based on leaked CAD blueprints.

The images show the phone from all angles, and highlight a metal frame and a shiny glass back, making for a marked departure from the metal-backed iPhone 7.

There’s also a vertically aligned dual-lens camera, in place of the horizontally aligned one on the iPhone 7 Plus. This has been rumored before and it’s thought that the change could somehow be needed to help with rumored augmented reality functions of the phone.

Image 1 of 3 Image 2 of 3 Image 3 of 3

Big screen, small body

The port and button placement largely seems similar to what’s gone before though, with two speaker grilles and a Lightning port on the bottom edge, a power button on the right edge and volume buttons on the left.

Apparently the iPhone 8 pictured here has dimensions of 143.5 x 70.9 x 7.7mm, which would make it slightly bigger in all dimensions than the 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm iPhone 7, but smaller (though still slightly thicker) than the iPhone 7 Plus.

Despite that it will probably have a bigger screen than either, with many current rumors pointing to a 5.8-inch display, achieved by removing the home button and having an all-screen front, as you can also see in these images.

The source of this leak theorizes that the fingerprint scanner could instead be built either into the display itself, as has been rumored a number of times, or into the Apple logo on the back.

These images largely line up with a dummy unit we saw previously. That too was supposedly based on leaked designs, so the source diagrams could be the same.

These latest images were sourced for MySmartPrice by @OnLeaks, who is one of the more reputable leakers in the business, but they themselves aren’t certain that this will be the iPhone 8’s final form, as Apple has apparently been working on a number of prototypes, so this could end up being an unused design.

We might not know for sure until September, when the iPhone 8 is expected to be officially announced.",techradar
10,Would you let a robot perform your eye surgery? One just passed clinical trials,"The idea of having your eyes operated on is a pretty terrifying proposal at the best of times, but throw robot surgeons into the mix and it suddenly feels very James Bond. But robot optical surgery is now a very real possibility thanks to the University of Oxford in the UK.

For the first time a robot has passed clinical trials to perform highly delicate retinal surgery, meaning it could soon become a fixture in hospital wards. The robot, named R2D2 (yes, really) outperformed its human counterparts in the control group.

The reason that a robot is proving so effective in this field is the microscopic level of movement needed to perform the surgery, well outside the capabilities of even the most competent surgeon.

Talking to the BBC about the Robotic Retinal Dissection Device (R2D2), the program’s director Dr Robert MacLaren said: “Current technology with laser scanners and microscopes allows us to monitor retinal diseases at the microscopic level, but the things we see are beyond the physiological limit of what the human hand can operate on.

""With a robotic system, we open up a whole new chapter of eye operations that currently cannot be performed.”

Slow and steady

In order to operate on a retina, an incision 10 microns deep at the back of the eye is necessary. For reference, a human hair averages at about 60 microns. As precise as human surgeons are, even the pulse of their heart is enough to move their hand more than 10 microns.

The clinical trial took the form of 12 retina membrane removal operations, 6 by human surgeons, 6 by R2D2. In the group operated on by the human surgeons, there were five micro-hemorrhages (minor bleeds) and two retinal touches, which we feel a bit queasy just writing. In comparison, R2D2 only had two micro-hemorrhages and one retinal touch.

If it helps set your mind at ease, the robot is still controlled by a human surgeon so it isn’t deciding where and when to cut, yet.

9,Why Mitchell Trubisky drove his grandma's 1997 Toyota to Bears minicamp | FOX Sports,"Mitchell Trubisky has yet to sign an NFL contract, which will eventually make him a millionaire. Even when he does sign on the dotted line, though, he’ll probably still drive the same old car he always has.

The rookie currently drives a 1997 Toyota Camry with more than 170,000 miles on it. When he was drafted by the Bears, general manager Ryan Pace made him promise to drive the Camry all the way from Chapel Hill to Lake Forest for rookie minicamp.

On Thursday, Trubisky arrived, sticking to his word.

Ryan Pace made Tru promise he'd drive his car, formerly grandma's car, to Halas Hall. The kid kept his promise. pic.twitter.com/Lxil2nJkiB — Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) May 11, 2017

It’s amazing that a car that old with nearly 200,000 miles could make it from North Carolina to Illinois, but it made it. The Camry used to belong to his grandmother, and he’s kept it in the family ever since he received it from her. Why?

“I’m a very simple person,” Trubisky said, via CBS Chicago. “That’s who I’ve always been, that’s how I was raised, to be conservative and stick to who I am. That’s who I’m going to be.”

This is similar to Kirk Cousins driving his family’s old van, and Alfred Morris still pushing the car he bought for $2 from his pastor as a college junior. Perhaps there’s just something about being comfortable in an old ride.

Eventually, Trubisky will have to buy a new ride, just don’t expect that to happen any time soon.",fox-sports
9,Stipe Miocic: 'Keep doubting me' and 'I'm going to keep shutting you up' | FOX Sports,"Stipe Miocic knows all the facts about the heavyweight title.

He’s heard how no champion in UFC history has ever defended the belt more than two times and that includes a laundry list of legends like Hall of Famers Mark Coleman and Randy Couture.

Still, defying the odds is something Miocic does best and that’s why he truly believes he’s the one who will break through that glass ceiling to defend the heavyweight title on more than two occasions.

“Keep doubting me, please. I love it. I’m going to keep shutting you up,” Miocic told FOX Sports ahead of his fight against Junior dos Santos at UFC 211.

“Just keep telling me that I’m not good and I’m not going to win and I’ll keep shutting you up.”

Part of Miocic’s confidence actually stems from his first fight with dos Santos back in 2014.

On that night, dos Santos earned a hard fought decision over Miocic, which was only the second time the Cleveland, OH native has suffered a defeat in his career. As heartbreaking as it was to suffer that loss, Miocic also believes that fight was the turning point in his career that eventually brought him to the championship.

It might sound strange but Miocic is actually grateful to dos Santos for what happened in their first fight because it gave him everything he needed to know he could hang with the best of the best in the UFC before one day becoming king.

“I’m at where I’m at because of that fight. I want to thank him for that fight,” Miocic said. “Because that’s where I’m at today because of him. I put myself in that position. He’s an animal. He’s a former champ and he’s going to stay a former champ because I’m going to stay champ. Fighting him changed everything. I made a comment to my coach actually that night, I said if we fought tomorrow, I’d beat him. Because I knew what I did wrong and I knew what I had to do.

“Things changed. Come see May 13, see what happens.”

Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports

The grueling war with dos Santos was also the first time Miocic had prepared for five rounds much less actually gone that far into a fight so it was a learning experience for the future.

Since that time, Miocic has earned four consecutive knockouts including his title fight victory over Fabricio Werdum as well as his first defense against Alistair Overeem this past September at UFC 203.

But it was all predicated on that 25-minute battle with dos Santos that not only showed Miocic he belonged amongst the best fighters in the world, but it forced him to get that much better so he would never suffer through another loss like that again.

“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. It showed me that I have everything I need to be champion. I’m getting more and more amped thinking about it and thanking him,” Miocic said. “It’s going to be a lot different on May 13, I’ll tell you right now. I am a completely different person. I feel like nobody gives me the props, which is fine, I love it. I love being the underdog.

“I always feel like I’m the underdog. I feel like I’m the underdog in this fight cause he beat me the last time and everyone thinks he had a good fight against Ben Rothwell. Good for him. Nothing’s going to change. Make me the underdog. I love shutting people up.”

Miocic has faced his fair share of naysayers over the years, but he’s also heard dos Santos talk about dominating this rematch after already holding a win over him from nearly three years ago.

In fact, dos Santos has predicted that he will finish Miocic inside two rounds, which earned a smirk and then a grimace from the reigning and defending heavyweight champion when he heard that news.

In response, Miocic won’t be as brash as to call his shot when he’ll put dos Santos away, but he promises the judges can take the rest of the night off once the main event starts on Saturday night.

“It’s not going the distance. He knows it, I know it and I’m the one that’s winning. I’m walking out with the belt still wrapped around my waist,” Miocic said.

“You’ll find out when I have my hand raised May 13. But I’m winning. I’m walking out with that belt still around my waist. I’ll tell you that right now. That’s going to happen for damn sure.”",fox-sports
6,No one can save Trump from himself,"(CNN) So maybe a few times in your life you have screamed at the television set. And then what? You flip the channel, and get on with your life.

Ah, unless you're the current President of the United States. Because he probably watches way more TV than you do, and when he sees something he doesn't like, he doesn't flip. He stews. He calls his friends and complains. He tweets.

And then he acts, because he can.

According to a source with knowledge, Trump told friends he was increasingly concerned that FBI Director James Comey had grown ""out of control"" and was ""pursuing his own agenda."" Comey's testimony last week, this source says, ""pushed him to the edge.""

So he acted out, and decided to fire Comey, in a childish, impetuous -- and dangerous -- manner. Then he looked for a rationale, and found it in a memo written by Rod Rosenstein, deputy attorney general.

The White House used that cover story; so did the vice president. But now Trump has blown up that explanation by telling NBC that he would have fired Comey no matter what Justice officials had recommended. (Did Trump lie to Pence like Mike Flynn did? Just asking.)

And all credibility is lost.

JUST WATCHED Trump biographers' insights on first 100 days Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump biographers' insights on first 100 days 04:11

Apparently, no one is able to tell the 70-year-old newbie how to behave. That firing the current FBI director in the middle of the Russia investigation -- no matter how tarnished his reputation -- is a bad idea. No one can tell him that, no matter how furious he is about an investigation that is growing and requiring more resources, trying to kill it by striking at the FBI director is a very, very bad idea. And that it might be interpreted as obstruction of justice.

But none of this matters to Trump. It never has. As Louise Sunshine, a former Trump organization employee told me months ago, Trump had always lobbed grenades -- and then walked away.

""Nobody ever knew when he walked in a meeting what he was going to say or do because he didn't,"" she said. ""Donald has always managed to walk into a meeting and say something that nobody else expected him ever to say, upend the entire meeting, leave everybody agog, and control every situation that way, so by the time he leaves the room, he has the store, he owns the store.""

But this isn't Trump's store anymore.

Trump has clearly learned little in office. He still throws tantrums, and his staff is sent to clean up the mess.

The pattern was set on the first full day in office.

That's when Trump fumed about the pictures about crowd size at his inauguration, and sent his press secretary Sean Spicer, out there to rationalize his obsession.

Then came the president's ridiculous assertion that there were 3 million illegal votes cast in the election -- and that's why he lost the popular vote.

That's when Spicer came out to try and explain the unexplainable. The solution -- just set up a presidential commission to examine the fiction, which the White House finally announced Thursday.

Then came the president's impulsive tweet-storm early on Saturday morning, March 4, when he accused his predecessor of having him wiretapped. Never mind that he was accusing Barack Obama of a felony, or that it wasn't true. He did it, anyway.

So then, once again, came the shovel brigade. Because to balk, even a bit, would be seen as disloyal to Trump --and that is not allowed. Ever.

Only this time it was really hard to figure out how to explain the unexplainable. And so a plan was hatched: call for congressional investigations. And stop talking about Russia hacks and potential Russian collusion with the campaign, but focus instead on investigating leaks that cast a negative light on Trump and his people.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

You get the idea. The President tweets nonsense, and the staff scrambles to make it sensible. Even if the emperor has no clothes, you can't tell him.

So it was with the firing of James Comey.

The President decides he wants to fire Comey, and the staff is tasked to come up with a rationale. But it was very hard this time -- absurd on its face. After he praised Comey in late October on the campaign trail and last week his spokesman declared confidence in the FBI director, are we to suddenly believe that the president really thought Comey was unfair to Hillary? Really? As one source close to the president tells me, his real concern was that if Comey had treated Clinton so badly, he would do the same to Donald Trump.

Oh, and as he told NBC, Comey was a ""showboat"" and a ""grandstander."" It was a telling insult; in Trump's galaxy, there can be no star brighter than Trump.

One requirement of the presidency is to believe that your job is about something greater than yourself -- your country.

But first you have to believe there is something greater than yourself.",cnn

3,France's Macron announces gender equal list of political outsiders,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The president-elect had made several conditions for candidates to sign up to

The party of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron has selected a diverse list of 428 candidates for parliamentary elections next month.

Only 24 of those chosen are outgoing MPs from the current parliament.

Some 52% come from civil society and exactly half are women, the secretary-general of La République En Marche (Republic on the Move) said.

Richard Ferrand said the choices marked ""the definitive return of citizens to the heart of our political life"".

Mr Macron still needs to select more than 100 candidates for the 577-seat parliament and the party says its door is open to politicians from other parties to join.

Youngest is 24

The movement received more than 19,000 applications, Mr Ferrand said at a news conference, with 1,700 telephone interviews conducted with candidates.

The average age of the list is 46 ""compared to 60 years for the average of outgoing MPs"", he said.

The youngest candidate is 24 years old, while the oldest is 72. Around 10 candidates are unemployed, double that are retired and a handful are students.

Image copyright AFP Image caption On the list: Cédric Villani, a famous mathematician, made the cut

All of the outgoing MPs chosen to run come from the Socialist Party of departing President François Hollande.

Mr Ferrand confirmed that Mr Macron's ex-cabinet colleague Manuel Valls - the former prime minister who has now burned his boats with his Socialists - had not been selected.

He said that he did ""not meet the criteria"" because he had already served three parliamentary terms.

But the party will not be running a candidate against him in his constituency in Essonne, south of Paris.

France had been waiting to see if the party list would live up to Mr Macron's pledge to clean up France's public life.

Who are they?

Many of the candidates are unknown to the public and there are few well-known personalities on the list.

Among the diverse candidates are Cédric Villani, a famous mathematician with a penchant for flamboyant bow-ties and spider brooches. He won the Fields Medal - seen as one of the highest honours in mathematics - in 2010.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Elite police commander Jean-Michel Fauvergue is a candidate

François Hollande's communications advisor Gaspard Gantzer, former judge Éric Halphen and former bullfighter Marie Sara are also on the list.

Although no MPs of the Republican party are candidates, at least two former allies of Alain Juppé - who lost the centre-right party's presidential primary - have been selected.

Where's the right? Analysis: BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris

It has escaped no-one's attention that there are nearly 150 names still missing.

Why this lack of clarity? Why the delay? Why is Mr Macron's party unable to do what it said it would do and give the country the full roster of names?

The answer is that it is engaged in some very old-style political calculation.

Emmanuel Macron knows that his weak point is his connection with the outgoing regime. He is a socialist at heart, as he has often said, and made his name serving a Socialist Party president.

If his party goes into the election fielding too many ex-Socialist MPs, it will be a sitting target for a vengeful Republican Party, eager to get its own majority and force the new president into a ""cohabitation"" (where the government is of a different colour from the president).

So the party wants a few more days to tempt over Republican Party defectors. Only in the middle of next week will it draw up its definitive list.

Read more from Hugh

Some of the names previously announced include:

Jean-Michel Fauvergue, a police commander who led the elite RAID unit's response to several jihadist attacks including the Bataclan massacre in Paris

Laetitia Avia, a Paris barrister involved in solving corporate disputes and active in projects in sub-Saharan Africa

Farmer Jean-Baptiste Moreau, who heads a co-operative

Head teacher Mireille Robert, also involved in campaigns to tackle unemployment

Alexandre Aïdara, public servant who founded Citizen Regeneration think tank, ex-adviser to justice ministry

French media are already reporting errors on the list - including one candidate with a criminal record (the party said no-one with a criminal record would be eligible). Several people on the list have also denied they are candidates.

Why are the candidates being unveiled now?

Mr Macron was only elected on Sunday and the two-round parliamentary vote takes place on 11 and 18 June. But with only one month to go, every political party is now focusing on the race for the National Assembly.

His recently rebranded party is only 13 months old and Mr Macron needs to show he will have not just a mandate but the power in parliament to push through his programme.

Image copyright En Marche Image caption The first candidates revealed last month included a farmer, a businessman, a journalist and an elite police officer

How are the candidates chosen?

Nearly 20,000 people applied and a few thousand only added their names in the past few days following the election.

6,"Stained, missing surgical equipment at DC VA halts surgery, prompts warning","The Oklahoma City Veterans' Affairs Medical Center treats 60,000 veterans annually. (Photo: Donovan Slack, USA TODAY)

WASHINGTON — Investigators found stained surgical equipment and a surgery had to be halted at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington Wednesday because staff lacked equipment, indicating patients there are still in danger and prompting the VA’s chief watchdog to immediately notify members of Congress.

A patient prepped for vascular surgery in the operating room at the hospital had already been placed under anesthesia when “it was determined that the surgeon did not have a particular sterile instrument to perform the surgery,” VA Inspector General Michael Missal wrote in a letter Wednesday.

“The surgery was postponed,” he wrote. “In addition, we identified other surgical instruments that had color stains of unknown origin in sterile packs. This made the instrument packs unsuitable for surgeries.”

The letter, addressed to VA acting Undersecretary for Health Poonam Alaigh and copied to lawmakers, comes almost a month after Missal issued a rare report alerting the public to equipment shortages and other problems at the Washington VA that were putting patients at risk. Within hours of the report’s release April 12, VA Secretary David Shulkin removed the medical center’s director and installed a top deputy to take over.

But Missal said in his letter that eight recommendations from his report still have not been implemented. And he said his investigators’ findings on Wednesday constitute “further troubling incidents that indicate patients are being placed at unnecessary risk.”

“These further incidents raise serious concerns that surgeries and other procedures requiring sterile equipment may be performed with unsuitable equipment,” Missal wrote. “We therefore ask that you immediately take necessary and appropriate action to ensure that patients at the DC VA (Medical Center) are not placed at unnecessary risk and inform me promptly of the steps VA leadership intends to take to respond to these issues.”

Read more:

A spokesman for the VA did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Thursday. Shulkin has said he worked quickly to fix the failures identified in Missal’s report last month and that he was confident that as of two weeks ago, “patient safety is not at all compromised.""

The report last month said investigators found 18 of 25 sterile storage areas were dirty at the hospital, which serves more than 98,000 veterans in the nation’s capital. They found chemical strips used to verify equipment sterilization had expired, so tests performed on nearly 400 items were not reliable.

They found the hospital lacked an effective inventory system and equipment shortages were common. In the past three years, there were 194 reports that patient safety has been compromised because of insufficient equipment.

In the weeks before the report’s release, the operating room had ran out of vascular patches to seal blood vessels and ultrasound probes used to map blood flow. The facility had to borrow bone material for knee replacement surgeries. And at one point, the hospital ran out of tubes needed for kidney dialysis, so staff had to go to a private-sector hospital and ask for some.

The report said senior VA leaders had known about the problem for months and hadn’t fixed it.

In his letter to Aleigh, Missal did not specify which fixes remain undone. Shulkin has said VA officials put a new inventory system in place.

Missal said his office has not found any instances of “adverse patient outcomes” but his office is continuing to investigate.

16,Why Steve Harvey told talk-show staffers to leave him alone,"In a leaked staff memo, Steve Harvey reportedly laid out rules barring them from talking to him without making an appointment first. (Photo: Bryan Steffy, Getty Images for Nu-Opp, Inc)

On what should be a momentous day for his five-year-old syndicated talk show, Steve Harvey is dealing with a leaked memo in which he reportedly told staff not to speak to or approach him.

Thursday marks The Steve Harvey Show's last taping at its home at Chicago's NBC Tower before moving west to Los Angeles. When it returns this fall for Season 6, it will have a shortened title, Steve, and more celebrity guests. And thanks to a deal struck last year with NBC Universal and IMG, Harvey will have an ownership stake and more control.

Harvey, 60, confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that he did send the staff memo that was leaked to Chicago media blog RobertFeder.com and picked up by Variety and Deadline.com.

In the email, sent to employees as they returned to work last fall, he laid out new rules banning staffers from ""popping into"" his dressing room or the makeup room to see him or approaching him in the hallway in hopes of having a walk-and-talk meeting.

""I want all the ambushing to stop now,"" he wrote. ""That includes TV staff. You must schedule an appointment. I have been taken advantage of by my lenient policy in the past. This ends now. NO MORE.""

Harvey stressed throughout the memo that he felt he had to make changes in order to keep his work days from being eaten up by impromptu meetings and glad-handing backstage visitors. ""It is for the good of my personal life and enjoyment,"" he explained, asking them not to take offense.

He asked critics to put themselves in his shoes, noting, ""If you come out your house, you don't want anybody on your porch waiting on you. You walk to your car, you don't want people bothering you on your way to your car. Everybody wants the freedom to be able to move around.""

Later, he described the daily interruptions to ET: ""Look, man, I'm in my makeup chair, they walk in the room. I'm having lunch, they walk in, they don't knock,"" he continued. ""I'm in the hallway, I'm getting ambushed by people with friends that come to the show and having me sign this and do this.""

While he won't apologize for the memo's overall message, he admits, ""In hindsight, I probably should've handled it a little bit differently.""

It's worth noting that the talk show isn't the only project occupying Harvey's days. He hosts two other programs, NBC's Little Big Shots and ABC's updated Family Feud as well as a radio show, rivaling Ryan Seacrest for having the most jobs in showbiz.

It's possible the memo was leaked by one of the dozens of Harvey staffers who were not invited to move west to work on the revamped show and are now out of work.

In the last year, Harvey has come under fire for making fun of Asian men on his show as well as meeting with then President-elect Donald Trump and his HUD nominee, Dr. Ben Carson, to discuss ideas for inner-city programs during the transition.

""Our president (Obama) asked that all of us sit down and talk to one another in order to move our country forward,"" the host of Family Feud and The Steve Harvey Show noted in a statement posted to Twitter in mid-January. ""The transition teams on both sides asked me to meet and I'm glad I did.""

Harvey also reached meme status last year when he announced the wrong winner at the end of the 2015 Miss Universe pageant, a blunder he was reminded of many times during the 2016 pageant and that is likely to end up in his obituary. But he's learned to have a sense of humor about it.

After a similar snafu happened during the presentation of this year's best-picture Oscar, he extended an offer to presenter Warren Beatty: ""Call me. I can help you get through this.""

9,Jeurys Familia is the latest Met to be lost for extended period | FOX Sports,"The New York Mets took another hit on Thursday, when they announced closer Jeurys Familia has been diagnosed with an arterial clot in his right (pitching) shoulder and might need surgery.

Jeurys Familia was examined today by doctors at the Hospital for Special Surgery and diagnosed with an arterial clot is his right shoulder. — New York Mets (@Mets) May 11, 2017

Familia is heading to St. Louis to meet with Dr. Robert Thompson, an expert in circulation issues who diagnosed and performed surgery on Matt Harvey last summer. He also performed the 2012 surgery on then-Mets pitcher Dillon Gee, who was similarly diagnosed with a blood clot in his shoulder. Gee also missed the rest of the season.

Thompson is considered the leading expert on thoracic outlet syndrome…. https://t.co/D7MMrM0EeP — Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) May 11, 2017

#Mets didn't offer timetable/severity/treatment for Familia. David Cone had an arterial blood clot near arm pit in '96, missed 4 months. — Joel Sherman (@Joelsherman1) May 11, 2017

Familia missed the first 15 games of the 2017 regular season because of a suspension, the result of an alleged offseason domestic violence incident. Since his return, he has not been as effective as the past two seasons when he was a dominant force out of the Mets’ bullpen. Familia has three saves and a 3.86 ERA in 11 appearances this season. He led the National League with 51 saves in 2016.

On Wednesday, Familia blew his first save of the year, allowing four runs (three earned) in one-third of an inning in a 6-5 loss to the Giants.

The injury news about Familia comes on top of the controversy stirred when starter Matt Harvey was suspended for three games after failing to show up this past Saturday. Another of the Mets’ young arms, Noah Syndergaard, has also been lost for an extended period due to a lat injury. Syndergaard joined fellow starters Seth Lugo (elbow) and Steven Matz (elbow) – and multiple other teammates – on the disabled list last week.

10,Microsoft Build 2017: the biggest highlights and all the news,"The second keynote of Build 2017 didn't disappoint when it came to big announcements, with seemingly something for everyone.

Whether another update coming to Windows 10, its accompanying features, cross-platform collaborations, a Mixed Reality accessory and a whole new design language, Microsoft gave us plenty to digest as it put a bow on Build.

Read on for the biggest moments of Day 2, and jump to the next page to catch up on everything that happened on Day 1.

Windows 10 Fall Creators Update

Microsoft is releasing another update to its Windows 10 operating system later this year, and it's appropriately called the Fall Creators Update.

Within the update are several new features, some of which we'll dive into in just a little bit. Much of the update centers around a new design language, a unified and responsive experience for users, new applications, and letting users work quickly and seamlessly from any device, whether Windows, iOS and Android.

A big part of the Fall Creators Update is a new design language for developers, called the Fluent Design System. This will essentially allow for responsive, unified apps, experiences and interactions within Windows 10. Developers can create ""more expressive and engaging apps,"" Microsoft says, and one of its most important features is that it fosters harmony across devices and platforms.

In other words, no more using an app that looks a certain way on one device only to find it's completely different on another device - a jarring experience, to say the least.

Fluent Design also aims to improve input diversity, letting users interact with their machines using touch, pen, voice, gestures and even eye control.

The simplest way to think of Fluent Design is that it will allow for harmonious and responsive cross-device experiences, which should be a boon for developers and users alike.

New Fall Creators Update apps and features

New applications and features are of course an important part of the Windows Fall Creators Update. Here are the standouts Microsoft detailed today:

Windows Story Remix is a creative app that lets users edit their photos and videos, adding everything from filters to music to 3D augmented reality objects.

The app can stitch together photos and videos from different sources to create one video, and can intelligently identify people in an image of clip. The whole idea is to help users create shareable moments, tapping into the creative tools Microsoft and others bring to the application.

The Timeline feature in the Fall Creators Update will let users retrace their steps to whatever they were doing last, such as recently accessed files, apps and websites they want to pull up again without starting from scratch. A visual timeline lets users see what they've done and select where they want to go. Think of it like macOS' Time Machine, but for hopping back to whatever was last on your desktop.

Along the same lines is the Pick Up Were You Left Off feature (Microsoft may want to shorten the name). Using Cortana, users can move activities across Windows, iOS and Android devices seamlessly, such as starting a doc on a Windows PC and picking it up on their Android phone.

Clipboard elicited a buzz from the Build crowd when announced. It basically lets users copy text from one device and paste it onto a phone, no matter who that phone is made by. Microsoft gave the example of copying the name of a business from a PC and pasting it into Google Maps on a Samsung Galaxy S8, to give you an idea.

Last but not least is OneDrive Files on Demand, a feature that lets you access any file you have stored in the cloud without downloading it. This will be great for saving space on your devices as well as collaborative projects. All changes made in the cloud will appear the next time you pull up a file. OneDrive Files on Demand will head to preview versions of Windows 10 in early summer.

iTunes is coming to the Windows Store

If you need to re-read that, we understand. No one in the Build crowd seemed to anticipate that iTunes is coming to Microsoft's digital marketplace, but as Terry Myerson revealed on stage, it's indeed true.

Apple's iTunes will arrive later this year, giving Windows users access to all it has to offer, including Apple Music.

While PC owners could already download iTunes from Apple directly, this marks the first time the service will be available right in the Windows Store.

This is a huge get for Microsoft's marketplace as it's notorious for having poor app selection. It's also a sign of Microsoft's embrace of competing platforms and services, a big change of course for the company.

Microsoft's Mixed Reality motion controllers

The one bit of new hardware Microsoft unveiled at Build are its own Mixed Reality motion controllers, designed for the suite of Windows Mixed Reality headsets on the way from various partners.

What really sets the controllers apart is that they don't require trackers positioned throughout a room, as you need with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive controllers to create a sense of room scale.

Instead, Microsoft's controllers rely on sensors inside the Mixed Reality headsets to track motion and pick up commands, meaning not only is there no extra installation, but you don't have to pay for any sensors.

What's more, this could make the whole system more portable as you don't need sensors set up anyone's house in order to use them.

The best bit of news is how affordable the controllers appear to be: though we don't know how much they cost on their own, Acer's Mixed Reality headset is getting bundled with the controllers for just $399, going on sale this holiday. That's significantly cheaper than what you'll find from Oculus or HTC.

Developers can pre-order Windows Mixed Reality headsets starting today

Microsoft is certainly moving the mixed reality ball forward, and its hardware partners are right along side.

It was revealed today that the developers in the US and Canada can pre-order Acer and HP's Windows Mixed Reality Headset Developer Edition headsets starting today from the Microsoft Store, and the devices will be delivered later this summer. Acer's headset is priced at $299 while HP's design is $329.

Though a shame you can't buy these headsets yet, it does mean developers get a chance to start working on Mixed Reality applications and other content before the headsets become available to consumers. This is how Oculus Rift released, and it's a smart play by Microsoft.

10,Prey review,"In Arkane’s smart and stylish revival of the 2006 first-person shooter, the moon-orbiting Talos 1 space station is being overrun by Typhon, a shape-shifting collective of aliens. It’s up to your character, Morgan Yu, to fight back by any means necessary. However, your goal is just as much about finding a motive worth fighting for.



Is there anyone left to save? Can I actually make a difference? And why am I in the middle of it all? These are all questions that you’ll answer with your actions, or at least try to, throughout the roughly 20 hour campaign.



For some gamers, a gun in-hand is reason enough to truck through to the game’s end. Prey is an action game, after all, so it wastes little time rolling out a pistol, wrench and shotgun, as well as a few other futuristic weapons, like the GLOO gun that freezes enemies in their tracks.



But if you’re looking for more depth in your FPS games, it’s not too difficult to find it here. Prey features a large skill tree filled with fun, upgradeable abilities that will make your trek feel dynamic and fresh, no matter your style of play.



Mixed in with the balance gunplay and supernatural abilities, players can further mix up their strategy by crafting items to build up your offense against the Typhon.



Unlike games like Arkane’s own Dishonored, and BioShock, you aren’t delivered an ending based on your level of violence or lack thereof. The multiple endings hinge on some big decisions you make throughout the story, both in the main quest and in how you handle many of its sidequests.



While Prey is a solid offering on almost all accounts, it misses the mark in a few areas. While performance on the PC was rock-solid, the clumsy melee combat controls never really seem to jive with the hectic movement of the Typhon creatures. And its story, which concludes majestically, takes a little too long to find its groove and misses a beat from time to time.

Talos 1 is so detail-packed that you’ll probably want to squeeze every drip out of it, but the game frustratingly steps on its own toes at times. For example, it’s all too easy to become overwhelmed with quest objectives that have you zipping around the environment faster than you can memorize its layout.



Also, character dialogue will sometimes overlap with audio logs, which essentially makes you miss out on two potentially important bits of story at once and is a little immersion-breaking for the serious atmosphere that Arkane has made.



All said, if you’re a fan of FPS games and enjoy a sci-fi setting, Prey is a must-play. But for the more discerning player, those few minor flaws might stand in your way of total enjoyment.

The tale on Talos 1

Prey is, more or less, an open-world game. As you explore Talos 1 on foot (and outside of it in glorious microgravity), you’ll come across new quests to take on and be treated to many bits of environmental storytelling and collectable lore in the form of notes and audio logs.



If you look and listen closely, you’ll notice the excellent narrative details put into the game, which paints a humanizing (or sometimes, dehumanizing) picture of life on the space station just before, and as, shit hit the fan with the Typhon invasion.

Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6

Prey has many layers to its narrative, but mostly leaves it up to you to peel them all back. It’s a shame that some of its more memorable beats are hidden away, but at least it gives you all the more reason to go back through the journey a second time.



Speaking on the bigger moments in the story that you can’t help but see play out in front of you, many of them unfold exactly as you’d expect. Thankfully, a few big curve balls tossed in along the way really help to avoid being fatigued by familiarity.

Attack and release

A few things are made very clear from the start of the game: you are outnumbered and outmaneuvered by the Typhon.



Ranging from the small, Half-Life headcrab-like Mimics, to the intimidating bipedal Phantoms (and a few others that I won’t spoil for you), the struggle is made just a little more bearable by knowing each enemy’s weakness, discoverable by scanning it with the Psychoscope a la Metroid Prime.



Equipped with this intel, finding the ideal mix and match of assault combos for each enemy type is endlessly satisfying. For most of the beasts, applying some motion-freezing GLOO, followed by some wrench action yields decent results. At best, you’ll lose little health and waste almost no resources in the process.

Speaking of resources, Prey features a robust inventory management system that’s actually a lot of fun to use. The remains of slain Typhon, as well as other scraps and abandoned tech can be salvaged for raw materials for use in crafting items like ammo, medkits and other things that are rare to come by during play, especially in the game’s tough later sections.



That said, there certainly are some encounters that call for the boomstick. And even though you aren’t punished for brute forcing your way through the game, the style of play that yielded the best results involved taking a moment to consider how each battle would affect my resources on hand. There’s nothing that I love more than saying hello to a Phantom with a loud gun, but in most cases (as I fail to illustrate below) I valued having a fat stack of reserve materials a little more.

The power of choice

Neuromods also help you even-out the fight against the Typhon. Shortly after you begin the journey, Morgan can learn new perks with these collectable items that can be used to unlock new abilities and upgrades to your suit’s capabilities.



Want to boost your strength, hack terminals and double your health gauge? Enjoy being stealthy? There’s a perk for that. Additionally, there are chipsets sprinkled throughout the campaign that give your suit some specialized powers, like the ability to see hidden mimics and granting you higher chances of landing critical blows with your favorite weapon, and more.

As such, the skill tree presented here allows for surprisingly deep customization, even allowing Morgan to take on certain traits of the Typhon to gain a considerable edge in combat. Abilities like shape-shifting, teleporting and mind-hacking really broaden the playbook when they become available around halfway through the journey. However, there are some interesting implications at stake for adopting the enemy’s ways.

To hunt and to be hunted

I have a confession to make: it took me a while to not suck at Prey. A common scenario involved being ambushed by a lowly Mimic while it was disguised as a mug. Effortlessly juking around the room, it avoided my every swing of a wrench. Having drained all of my stamina, I realize that I am the prey, owned by the easiest enemy in the game.



While I did become more proficient later on, the wild enemy patterns are tougher to read than they seem. To that end, I appreciate that this game enforces learning through failures and plotting out your attack, even when it’s just a casual encounter with a relatively harmless enemy.



In the end, the harsh, but fair difficulty made applying learned battle tactics to each Typhon encounter during my bleak tenure on Talos 1 one of the more rewarding things I’ve done in a game this year.



Prey is a captivating exploration of how far humans will go to sustain their species, even at the cost of their own lives or others. While it suffers from poor pacing at times and a few quality of life issues, this game more than makes up for it with surprising depth in its story, an incredible atmosphere and an open-ended approach that caters to casual and more hardcore gamers alike.

Arkane has crafted one of my favorite experiences of 2017.

Verdict: Play it now

Prey was reviewed on the PC with code provided by Bethesda.

TechRadar's review system scores games as 'Don't Play It', 'Play It' and 'Play It Now', the last of which is the highest score we can give. A 'Play It' score suggests a solid game with some flaws, but the written review will reveal the exact justifications.",techradar
10,"iTunes is coming to the Windows Store, Apple Music and all","In a move that surprised many, Microsoft announced during its Build 2017 keynote today that it's bringing Apple's iTunes to the Windows Store.

While PC owners running Windows have had the ability to download iTunes directly from Apple, this is the first time users get the media player directly from Microsoft's own digital marketplace.

The announcement is also a head-turner because the Windows Store has a reputation for its underwhelming selection of apps, especially ones from platform competitors like Apple.

iTunes is planned to hit the Windows Store by the end of this year and is expected to be fully functional, to include support for Apple Music.

6,Senate gives bipartisan backing to Trump's nominee for U.S. trade representative,"Robert Lighthizer speaks at the Senate Finance Committee hearing on his nomination to be U.S trade representative on March 14, 2017. (Photo: Tasos Katopodis, AFP/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Thursday confirmed President Trump's nominee for U.S. trade representative on a bipartisan vote despite complaints from some Republicans that the administration has an ""ongoing, incoherent and inconsistent trade message.""

The Senate voted 82-14 to confirm Robert Lighthizer, who served as deputy U.S. trade representative under President Ronald Reagan and has worked on trade issues as a lawyer representing various manufacturers and high-tech companies.

Lighthizer will take his cues from a president who has broken with most Republicans in his criticism of free-trade agreements and who has spread the work on trade policy beyond the office of the United States Trade Representative.

Two Republican senators said late Wednesday they would oppose Lighthizer. Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a two-page letter to Lighthizer that his confirmation process had failed to reassure them he understands the economic benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

""Beyond your vocal advocacy for protectionist shifts in our trade policies, the administration's ongoing, incoherent and inconsistent trade message has compounded our concern,"" they wrote.

The senators said they doubted that Lighthizer would champion agriculture and negotiate trade deals to the benefit of American consumers and the economy.

Trump nearly bailed on NAFTA. He repeatedly derided the 1994 pact during the campaign as the worst trade deal ever and mocked his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, for her support for the agreement. President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993.

McCain and Sasse said Lighthizer has made his skepticism of NAFTA well-known, ""which we find to be alarming.""

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he told Lighthizer there are definitely opportunities to update and improve NAFTA.

""But it is important that the administration follow the spirit of the Hippocratic oath: First do no harm,"" Hatch said in endorsing Lighthizer before the vote.

Some of Lighthizer's strongest support came from Democratic lawmakers.

Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said Lighthizer not only understands how the global trading system works, but also how it sometimes breaks down. Still, Wyden complained that he wanted to get more clarity about the administration's trade agenda, saying it's clear that different factions in the administration have opposing agendas on trade issues.

""So far, this administration's trade strategy amounts to a muddle of 140-character tweets, mixed messages and overhyped announcements that are backed by little substance,"" Wyden said.

Lighthizer has criticized some Republicans for being too pro-free trade. He told a Senate panel this year that the U.S. should have an ""America first trade policy.""

""We can do better in negotiating our trade agreements and stronger in enforcing our trade laws,"" he said.

Trump's tough talk on trade has drawn support from states with a large percentage of manufacturing workers. But some farm groups are worried about how withdrawing from an Asia-Pacific trade deal and reworking other trade pacts could hurt sales of U.S.-produced beef, poultry and grains.

To help address that concern, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Thursday created a top post within the department to oversee trade and foreign agricultural affairs.

9,Dana White sets deadline for Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather negotiations | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White is ready to either get the deal done for Conor McGregor to face off with Floyd Mayweather or he’s walking away from the negotiating table all together.

White has stated for weeks that he was going to do everything in his power to get the fight done that would see the current UFC lightweight champion likely pocket a paycheck that could potentially exceed $75 million for the matchup with Mayweather.

According to White, his plan was to sit down with McGregor following the birth of his child, which took place last weekend, and now it appears he plans on speaking to the Irish fighter on Sunday to hammer out a deal.

White told Jim Rome on Thursday that he’s hoping to wrap up McGregor’s part of the negotiations on Sunday before then moving onto deal with Mayweather’s camp starting on Monday.

“I plan on having this thing locked up by this Sunday and then moving on to Team Mayweather and starting a negotiation with them. If we really do get it done in that time frame, then this thing could possibly happen,” White said.

“But again, I still need to go negotiate with [Floyd Mayweather’s team]. There’s no guarantee that we’re going to come to a deal.”

The flipside is White also stating that if he can’t reach an agreement with McGregor on financial terms on Sunday then he’s calling a stop to the negotiations and moving on from the fight all together.

White said Sunday is “absolutely” his deadline to get a deal done with McGregor but he’s feeling “pretty good” about coming to an agreement with the UFC lightweight champion.

“Hopefully Monday I’m going to sit down to negotiate with Team Mayweather,” White teased.

McGregor and Mayweather have been flirting with this matchup for more than a year, but it appeared in recent months that the fight was actually going to come together.

The sticking point has always been the financial stakes for McGregor and Mayweather with both fighters claiming to be the larger draw in the matchup, which would mean a bigger piece of the lucrative pay-per-view pie that would undoubtedly earn a ton of money.

White promised McGregor that he would do everything in his power to get the deal done but the sand in the hourglass is nearly running out with the UFC president setting a deadline when he’s walking away from the table.

By all accounts it appears White will know by Monday if he’s one step closer towards making the fight a reality or putting a nail in the coffin for this long rumored matchup once and for all.

“Yeah I just can’t keep messing with this thing,” White said. “I need to run my business and I have to focus on all the other things that are going on around here.”",fox-sports
16,3 smart business ideas for Millennials in 2017,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Millennials in the United States have a different set of values on social and economic topics than the generations before them, according to a new report from the U.S. Census Bureau Time

Millennials face financial barriers when trying to start a business, including higher student loan debt and lower starting wages than previous generations. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Millennials face financial barriers when trying to start a business, including higher student loan debt and lower starting wages than previous generations.

These challenges, cited in a 2016 survey by business services firm EY and policy organization Economic Innovation Group, are making it difficult for young people to become entrepreneurs.

Less than 2% of Millennials were self-employed as of 2014, compared with 7.6% for Generation X and 8.3% for baby boomers, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration.

But entrepreneurship is still possible for Millennials, defined in this article as adults under 35: Here are three smart business ideas that match up well with the skills, interests and passions of many in this generation — along with the experiences of a few who have used them successfully.

1. Social media coaching or training

Social media is second nature to Millennials: 88% of people between the ages of 18 and 29 used Facebook every day in 2016, compared with 62% of those over the age of 65, according to a Pew Research Center study.

Social-media-savvy Millennials can turn those skills into a business teaching small businesses and others how to use digital tools to stay relevant in the marketplace.

Success story: Tracy Samantha Schmidt, 32, is a social media educator and digital marketing consultant. She says social media coaching is a low-cost, potentially lucrative business idea because it can lead to other opportunities in digital marketing.

“[Clients] may realize they need an email marketing person, a web designer, a blogger, a copywriter,” says Schmidt, a former journalist.

For social media coaching, a reasonable rate to charge is $50 an hour to start, according to Schmidt. “I know a lot of people who go for that rate,” she says. “Executives are willing to pay up to $200 per hour, but they’re going to want someone who’s done it for corporations and has credibility.” The amount you get may depend on the market where you live.

2. Nonprofit organization

Starting a nonprofit could be a good match for a socially conscious Millennial: 88% of Millennials say a job is more fulfilling if they can make a positive impact on social and environmental issues, according to a 2016 study by Cone Communications, a public relations and marketing agency.

While a nonprofit fulfills a social mission, it’s also important to operate it as a business and diversify sources of income, says Sarah LaFave, 28, a registered nurse who co-founded Lori’s Hands, which connects college student volunteers to people living with chronic illnesses in Newark, Del. She named the nonprofit after her mother, who died from breast cancer while LaFave was a high school freshman.

“We spend a lot of time thinking of new and creative ways to bring in funds so we’re never depending on a single source,” LaFave says.

Success story: Growing up working for his family’s moving company in New Jersey, Adam Lowy, 31, was bothered to learn that so much nonperishable food gets thrown away during a move. After donating to his local food bank, he learned that thousands in his county didn’t have enough to eat.

That experience led Lowy to start Move for Hunger, which works with moving companies to donate unwanted nonperishable food. It has delivered over 7 million pounds of consumables to food banks across North America since 2009.

“I feel like I’ve been able to make a difference in people’s lives, and to me that’s way more rewarding than any paycheck,” Lowy says.

Identify a problem and come up with a solution the market has yet to find, just like you would try to do with a for-profit business, he says.

3. Subscription-based product or service

Millennials love their subscription services: 70% own a product subscription, such as Birchbox or Dollar Shave Club, while 89% own a service subscription, such as Netflix or Spotify. That’s more than any other generation, according to a 2017 study by payments processor Vantiv.

Young entrepreneurs can tap into the demand for subscription services to launch a business.

Success story: Ryan Perlowin, 29, is the founder and CEO of My Happy Plates, which delivers customized weekly meal plans and recipes via email. The subscription-service business model carries benefits for both entrepreneurs and customers, he says.

Many subscription services (My Happy Plates included) offer free trials, so customers can try them out and cancel at any time.

You can validate a business idea much faster and cheaper, and get valuable feedback from customers to incorporate into product changes, he says.

“Get a basic version of your product going without spending much time or money, and see if people adopt it,” he says. “If the problem is there, and you can validate that this is a real problem that you’re solving, you have to go for it.”

16,Why Steve Harvey sent that 'Don't talk to me' memo to talk-show staff,"In a leaked staff memo, Steve Harvey reportedly laid out rules barring them from talking to him without making an appointment first. (Photo: Bryan Steffy, Getty Images for Nu-Opp, Inc)

On what should be a momentous day for his five-year-old syndicated talk show, Steve Harvey is dealing with a leaked memo in which he reportedly told staff not to speak to or approach him.

Thursday marks The Steve Harvey Show's last taping at its home at Chicago's NBC Tower before moving west to Los Angeles. When it returns this fall for Season 6, it will have a shortened title, Steve, and more celebrity guests. And thanks to a deal struck last year with NBC Universal and IMG, Harvey will have an ownership stake and more control.

Harvey, 60, confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that he did send the staff memo that was leaked to Chicago media blog RobertFeder.com and picked up by Variety and Deadline.com.

In the email, sent to Steve Harvey Show employees as they returned to work last fall, he laid out new rules banning staffers from ""popping into"" his dressing room or the makeup room to see him or approaching him in the hallway in hopes of having a walk-and-talk meeting.

""Do not approach me while I’m in the makeup chair unless I ask to speak with you directly,"" he instructed them, saying they should knock or ring the doorbell before barging in.

""I want all the ambushing to stop now,"" he wrote. ""That includes TV staff. You must schedule an appointment. I have been taken advantage of by my lenient policy in the past. This ends now. NO MORE.""

He warned would-be violators, ""If you open my door, expect to be removed,"" adding that his security guards would be stationed outside his dressing room to turn away uninvited visitors.

Harvey stressed throughout the memo that he felt he had to make changes in order to keep his work days from being eaten up by impromptu meetings and glad-handing backstage visitors. ""It is for the good of my personal life and enjoyment,"" he explained, asking them not to take offense.

He asked critics to put themselves in his shoes, noting, ""If you come out your house, you don't want anybody on your porch waiting on you. You walk to your car, you don't want people bothering you on your way to your car. Everybody wants the freedom to be able to move around.""

Later, he described the daily interruptions to ET: ""Look, man, I'm in my makeup chair, they walk in the room. I'm having lunch, they walk in, they don't knock,"" he continued. ""I'm in the hallway, I'm getting ambushed by people with friends that come to the show and having me sign this and do this.""

While he won't apologize for the memo's overall message, he admits, ""In hindsight, I probably should've handled it a little bit differently.""

It's worth noting that the talk show isn't the only project occupying Harvey's days. He hosts two other programs, NBC's Little Big Shots and ABC's updated Family Feud as well as a radio show, rivaling Ryan Seacrest for having the most jobs in showbiz.

It's possible the memo was leaked by one of the dozens of Harvey staffers who were not invited to move west to work on the revamped show and are now out of work.

In the last year, Harvey has come under fire for making fun of Asian men on his show as well as meeting with then President-elect Donald Trump and his HUD nominee, Dr. Ben Carson, to discuss ideas for inner-city programs during the transition.

""Our president (Obama) asked that all of us sit down and talk to one another in order to move our country forward,"" the host of Family Feud and The Steve Harvey Show noted in a statement posted to Twitter in mid-January. ""The transition teams on both sides asked me to meet and I'm glad I did.""

Harvey also reached meme status last year when he announced the wrong winner at the end of the 2015 Miss Universe pageant, a blunder he was reminded of many times during the 2016 pageant and that is likely to end up in his obituary. But he's learned to have a sense of humor about it.

After a similar snafu happened during the presentation of this year's best-picture Oscar, he extended an offer to presenter Warren Beatty: ""Call me. I can help you get through this.""

9,Predictions for every fight on the UFC 211: Miocic vs. Dos Santos 2 main card | FOX Sports,"Joanna Jedrzejczyk vs. Jessica Andrade

UFC strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk faces what looks to be her toughest opponent to date when she battles former bantamweight contender Jessica Andrade.

Andrade is a rare mix of power and speed, and she’s been a huge problem for strawweights since dropping to the division in 2016. Jedrzejczyk has simply overwhelmed opponents with her volume on the feet, landing over 125 significant strikes in all four of her title defenses. But that fact shouldn’t worry Andrade, who has twice cracked the 100 significant strike threshold during her three fight winning streak at 115-pounds.

The key for Andrade in this bout will be her ability to close the distance against the taller and longer Jedrzejczyk. Joanna Champion isn’t known for her shifty footwork but she should be able to touch Andrade with her long jab enough to make the Brazilian think twice about rushing in with combinations.

It appears Jedrzejczyk has sown up the ground game issues that plagued her in her first fight against Claudia Gadelha, where she was planted seven times, but the threat of the takedown will still be there against the powerful Andrade, who has shown she can pull off a submission if the opportunity presents itself.

However, all signs point to this bout being fought predominantly in the stand-up, and a war of attrition bodes well for Jedrzejczyk, who has fought a full five rounds three times in her UFC career compared to none for Andrade. And I think that’s how the fight will be won -- Jedrzejczyk dragging Andrade into the championship rounds and pulling away with her world-class stamina that allows her to be just as effective in the fifth round as she is at the opening bell.",fox-sports
6,Here's a timeline leading up to James Comey's firing and the fallout it unleashed,"(CNN) FBI Director James Comey was fired abruptly Tuesday by President Donald Trump, and the White House has scrambled since then to explain how Trump reached his decision.

Here's a look at what led to Comey's firing and what's happened in the aftermath:

Trump tweets a response that night: ""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!""

Comey, testifying before senators in a committee hearing, says he's ""mildly nauseous"" at the idea he influenced the election when he reopened the Clinton email investigation. Still, he defended his decision to do so.

At the time, Trump said that Comey's decision ""took guts"" and that the FBI chief ""brought back his reputation"" by reopening the investigation.

In his testimony, Comey says he publicly announced his conclusions in the Clinton email investigation after deciding the Justice Department's credibility had been affected by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch's airport tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton.

Comey adds the Russians are still meddling in US politics because they may have concluded, ""This works.""

6,Timeline: Trump's words contradict White House answers on Comey firing,"Trump told NBC News on Thursday that he was going to fire Comey with or without Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's memo criticizing the director.

That statement contradicts at least 10 times Trump's top aides and advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, tried to explain the how and the why the President decided to sack Comey. Tuesday's unceremonious move came amid the FBI's probe into Russia's role in the 2016 election and any connections the Trump campaign had to the hackers.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation,"" Trump told NBC. He added: ""(Rosenstein) made a recommendation ... He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.""

Washington (CNN) The White House says President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey because of his treatment of Hillary Clinton. But there's mounting evidence it also had something to do with the continuing investigation by the FBI into the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia.

CNN's Jake Tapper has reported a source close to Comey says the now-former director never offered his loyalty to President and that the pace of the investigation into alleged Russian connections to the Trump campaign was actually quickening.

We might never know what was going through Trump's mind when he took the unprecedented step.

But we do know for sure that Comey twice embarrassed the President while testifying in front of Congress by directly undercutting something Trump had been pushing.

6,ICE announces major anti-gang operation,"Story highlights Three of the arrests were former DACA recipients

Arrests included mostly US citizens

Washington (CNN) Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced its largest anti-gang operation ever on Thursday, a six-week operation that netted more than 1,300 arrests nationwide.

Though the effort was led by ICE, the focus was not exclusively on immigrants. Of the arrests, 933 were US citizens and 445 were foreign nationals, with 384 in the country illegally.

ICE said three of the arrested individuals were previous recipients of protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, instituted by the Obama administration for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.

Criminal violations or being deemed a public safety threat can void a person's DACA status.

ICE also noted that 10 of the arrests were of people who crossed the border as unaccompanied minors, eight of whom were confirmed to belong to the MS-13 gang , ICE said. Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, is strongest in Central America, especially El Salvador, but extends its criminal enterprise across the US, including cities like Los Angeles, New York and the Washington region.

9,Manchester United 1-1 Celta Vigo (2-1 agg),"Marouane Fellaini heads home United's goal

Manchester United survived a huge late scare to edge past Spanish visitors Celta Vigo and set up a Europa League final against Dutch giants Ajax.

Leading 1-0 from the first leg, United took control as Marouane Fellaini headed home Marcus Rashford's cross.

But Celta, needing two goals, levelled on the night through Facundo Roncaglia to set up a tense final few minutes.

United's Eric Bailly and Roncaglia were sent off after a mass brawl, and the hosts hung on to reach the final.

Indeed they could only celebrate after Celta striker John Guidetti scuffed a golden chance to put the visitors through to their first major European final with the final kick of the game.

The aggregate victory took the Red Devils a step closer to their first Europa League triumph and a return to the Champions League.

They will meet Ajax, who beat Lyon in the other semi-final, in Stockholm on 24 May.

Relive a tense night at Old Trafford

There were just six seconds left when Guidetti missed the chance to put Celta through

Functional not flashy - but in the final

United had never lost a two-legged European tie after winning the first leg away from home, and knew they would reach the final by keeping a clean sheet at an expectant Old Trafford.

The hosts looked nervy as Celta made an attacking start, before Fellaini settled the tension by converting his side's first effort on target.

The Belgium midfielder sneaked in at the far post to powerfully head in Rashford's clipped right-wing cross.

Jose Mourinho's side created few other chances as they aimed to frustrate the visitors with an organised and largely defensive approach.

Although Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Rashford and Fellaini all drew saves from Celta keeper Sergio Alvarez after the break, it was a functional - not flashy - performance.

Celta, who had lost their previous five matches and are 12th in La Liga, had more possession than the home side, and forced United keeper Sergio Romero into instinctive saves at the start of each half.

They then ignited the tie with Roncaglia's glancing header following a corner.

The away goal, which left them needing one more to eliminate United, increased the tension inside Old Trafford, leading to a scuffle involving almost all 22 players on the field.

Bailly was sent off for a swipe at former Manchester City striker Guidetti, with Roncaglia dismissed for retaliating.

With six minutes of added time, there was still opportunity for Celta to create one final chance - but Guidetti blew it.

While United's players greeted the final whistle with a mixture of relief and jubilation, the visitors slumped to the turf with Guidetti in tears.

""You cannot win a semi-final easily, or be calm. We are in the final, that's what counts,"" said United midfielder Ander Herrera.

United defender Bailly (second left) will miss the final after his red card

Europa League or bust for Mourinho

Winning the Europa League has become Mourinho's priority as he looks to secure a return to the Champions League in his debut season at Old Trafford.

And the campaign will be deemed a disappointing one if his team lose to Ajax, who edged out Lyon 5-4 on aggregate.

Expectations were high that Mourinho's arrival would bring an end to the malaise that has surrounded the Red Devils since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.

United have finished seventh, fourth and fifth in the three Premier League seasons since the Scot's departure - and Mourinho arrived with loftier ambitions than simply scraping into the top four.

Ten months later, the Portuguese has been forced to drastically reassess his ambitions.

He appears to have conceded defeat in the top-four race, with his team sixth, four points adrift of Manchester City going into their final three matches.

With the return leg against Celta at the forefront of his mind, Mourinho made eight changes for Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal - a clear admission he felt winning the Europa League was more attainable than breaking into the top four.

However, his decision will only be justified if they are successful in beating Ajax and claiming their sixth European trophy.

The missing piece in the jigsaw

The Red Devils have won 65 trophies in their illustrious 115-year history, a figure including 20 English league titles and three European Cup/Champions League victories.

However, there is one piece of silverware missing from the Old Trafford trophy room.

Winning the Europa League, or its predecessor the Uefa Cup, may have been considered an unwanted honour in previous Red Devils eras.

Now it is considered a must-win as the club looks to complete a clean sweep of the major competitions at home and abroad.

The front cover of Thursday's matchday programme creatively illustrated how United hope to complete a clean sweep

Analysis

Former England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 live:

""They are not the most technical Man Utd team I've ever seen. Mourinho is very good at setting a team up but it is not entertaining.

""United have always been entertainers and even if they win the Europa League, people will say: 'Yes they won it, but it wasn't entertaining.'

""The goal for Celta came from United's lack of concentration and it became a little bit ""panic stations"" for the rest of the match.

""Ajax are a young team - they could easily freeze in that final.""

Post-match reaction

Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho:

""We were the best team in the first leg but we never kill, we never score goals related to the chances we have. It was an open game at home, all the pressure on our side.

""They were completely free of responsibility and gave us a very hard match. We suffered until the end and it was open until the last second. The boys gave everything they had. I'm really pleased for them.

""After 14 matches, we are in the final. If we win the Europa League, I am more than happy. It would be amazing.""",bbc-news

(May 10) AP

WASHINGTON — Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be invited to an all-senators briefing next week to discuss his role in the firing of FBI Director James Comey.

A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office confirmed Thursday that he is working on scheduling the meeting.

“Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has been meeting with members and has made himself available to the leadership as well,"" said Don Stewart, the Kentucky Republican's spokesman. ""So the Leader is working on scheduling a briefing for members from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Once we have more information we’ll be sure to make an announcement.”

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who had been calling for the meeting, tweeted the invitation is ""a good first step & I thank him.""

Democrats have been calling on Rosenstein to start answering questions about his role in the firing, saying his “apolitical” reputation is on the line.

Schumer asked Rosenstein more than two dozen questions in a letter Thursday, including whether Comey had asked last week for additional resources for the ongoing counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

Both Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions recommended Comey’s dismissal to President Trump, though Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt on Thursday he would have fired Comey regardless.

Schumer wrote that there is wide skepticism that the justifications Rosenstein laid out in a memo to Sessions are the “real basis” for Trump’s decision. He asked whether Trump directed Rosenstein to write the memo, citing Comey’s handling of the investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. He requested answers by May 15.

“This skepticism, and indeed all of the circumstances surrounding Director Comey’s dismissal just as he was leading an investigation into the Trump administration’s and Trump campaign’s ties with Russia and President Putin’s interference with the 2016 election, have shaken public confidence in the Department, in your leadership, and in the administration of law and justice in our country,” Schumer wrote. “In order to restore the nation’s faith in you personally and in our law enforcement system more broadly, the American people must understand more about your role in the president’s firing of Director Comey.”

Schumer’s letter foreshadows the grilling Rosenstein would get if he appears at an all-senators briefing.

Rosenstein was in the Capitol on Thursday for a closed-door meeting with Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.

Democratic leaders on the Senate Appropriations Committee also sought information Thursday from Rosenstein on whether Comey requested additional resources before Trump fired him.

“The American people have a right to know, for the sake of our national security and sovereignty, whether and to what extent Russia interfered in the 2016 Presidential election,” wrote Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the committee’s highest-ranking Democrat, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee overseeing Justice Department spending. “Given the importance of this investigation, the FBI and the DOJ should spare no expense in getting to the truth.”

Democrats and even some Republicans have questioned Trump’s motives in firing Comey, but Republican leaders defended his decision.

While Democrats worked to keep the issue in the spotlight Thursday, they didn’t repeat Wednesday’s tactics to slow Senate business so that acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe could testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee in Comey’s place. Comey has been invited to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.

Schumer, in his Senate floor speech, continued to demand the appointment of a special prosecutor by a non-political appointee of the Justice Department. He called for Comey to testify before Congress. And he called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to hold separate, all-senators briefings with Sessions and Rosenstein that may be classified.

Schumer noted 94 senators voted last month for Rosenstein’s confirmation, but he said many now question their belief in his “reputation for integrity” and assurances that he would be “an independent force” inside the department.

“He owes it to the U.S. Senate, which confirmed him, to provide some answers,” Schumer said.

16,'Big Bang Theory' still booming as cliffhanger closes Season 10,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In this exclusive clip from the Season 10 finale, one of Sheldon's former admirers returns while Amy is away for the summer. That has his friends worried. WARNER BROS.

Just as cast, producers and CBS have come together for two more seasons of The Big Bang Theory, a separation poses a major test for Sheldon and Amy in Thursday’s Season 10 finale (8 ET/PT).

Caltech physicist Sheldon (Jim Parsons), who baby-stepped into a live-in arrangement with Amy (Mayim Bialik) at the start of the season, now must adjust to her being across the country, on a fellowship at Princeton.

Co-creator Chuck Lorre says the growth of that relationship and others – resulting in breakups, marriages and a baby -- is a key to the success of Bang (averaging 18.7 million viewers), which will outlast NBC hits Friends, Cheers and Frasier with its two-season extension. (Its ratings strength as TV's top comedy also has spawned a fall CBS prequel, Young Sheldon.)

“The best way to explore a character is to put that character into a relationship,” says Lorre. ""We started with these (brilliant scientists) who were extremely stunted in terms of their ability to connect with other human beings, especially women. And look where we are now. It's kind of mind-boggling.""

Parsons says Sheldon and Amy's move across the hall has forced him to relearn his footwork.

“I’m still adjusting to living in Penny’s apartment. Every once in a while, we're coming up the stairs and it's a nearly 10-year-old habit of turning toward the door of"" the old apartment, where spouses Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Penny (Kaley Cuoco) now live.

With Amy temporarily gone, Ramona Nowitzki (Riki Lindhome), an admiring grad student from Season 2, returns to make a romantic overture to Sheldon. Naïve as ever, he's oblivious, but Penny, Leonard and the gang worry about its effect on his relationship with Amy.

The slow-and-steady development of the characters — Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Raj (Kunal Nayyar), at the start, with Amy and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) arriving in Season 3 — has added comedy and a little heart, says executive producer Steven Molaro.

""In the very first episode, Leonard decides he loves Penny, and that has played out. Look at Wolowitz and how he's grown. When we met Raj, he couldn't speak if a girl was in the room. And the thought of Sheldon having a girlfriend seemed ridiculous in Season 3,"" says Molaro.

Although such changes can be acts of ratings desperation by long-running shows, Parsons sees the situation differently.

""They introduced (Amy and Bernadette) at a time well before anyone felt it was 'needed,'"" he says. ""It worked out beautifully, It's the same thing with life-changing storylines. I've never felt they were done at a time when we we were starving for something. Instead, it's done early enough that, as a cast, we go, 'Oof! Why?' Time after time, a year later, I'm saying, 'I'm so glad we did that..' ""

Bang is spawning an even bigger change withYoung Sheldon, which focuses on the genius's Texas upbringing and features a new cast and no studio audience.

Parsons will narrate the series, set to air this fall right after Big Bang. ""It's more of an origins story than a close cousin to Big Bang,"" he says. ""It's more like the beginnings of a superhero, which in this case is a genius nerdy kid.""

As that show blazes a new path, Lorre acknowledges the challenge of coming up with plots for Bang's 11th season. But ""I've had concerns (whether) there are enough stories since the pilot, and somehow we just finished shooting our 231st episode.""

6,Comey firing adds to GOP's load of political liabilities for midterms,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

WASHINGTON — A coalition of two progressive groups will launch a paid advertising campaign on Friday targeting eight moderate Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, demanding an independent investigation into whether President Trump colluded with Russia to influence the U.S. election. It's among the signs that Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey could have immediate political repercussions for his party.

Democrats in Congress have little leverage to force an independent commission or the appointment of a special counsel. Yet much like outside progressive groups organized around the unpopular House health care bill, they may have the power to make Russia a second major political liability for GOP lawmakers hesitant to back an independent commission or special prosecutor to investigate Trump’s potential ties to Russia. The groups, End Citizens United and Every Voice, say the campaign will be ongoing and they may expand their targets to additional Republicans. The campaign will also include polling and grassroots actions.

Town halls are another example of how quickly the issue is becoming a flash point for Republicans. They include forums this week by Rep. David Brat of Virginia and Rep. Tom MacArthur’s contentious town hall in New Jersey in which Russia and health care dominated the two-hour forum.

Finally, in Virginia, former Rep. Tom Perriello, a Democrat running for governor, wasted less than 24 hours in targeting his Republican competitor over the Comey firing. The Republican, Ed Gillespie, hasn’t spoken out on Comey’s sudden dismissal this week after he reportedly requested more resources to dig into potential ties between Trump associates and Russia. Virginia holds its gubernatorial elections in odd years.

Perriello, a former Democratic congressman, said in a Wednesday statement that Gillespie is refusing to “stand up to do the right thing” by calling for a special prosecutor as the country heads toward a “constitutional crisis.”

So far, Republican leaders led by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are rejecting an independent counsel in favor of pursuing existing House and Senate probes. Yet veteran Republican campaign strategists see political peril ahead as additional revelations about potential ties between Trump officials and the Russian campaign to influence the U.S. election continue to surface. That’s a particular risk after the Senate Intelligence Committee this week subpoenaed former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had previously requested immunity in exchange for his testimony.

“It’s vital that the party not handcuff themselves to Donald Trump,” said John Weaver, a former top adviser to the presidential campaigns of Senator John McCain, R-Ariz, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. “We’re ultimately going to have a special prosecutor. I don’t know why Republicans can’t read the next chapter in the book,” he said. “You’re going to see more and more Republicans coming to this conclusion.”

On Wednesday a number of Republicans, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said they were troubled by Comey’s sudden dismissal, while rejecting the idea of a special prosecutor.

Republicans argue that the history of special prosecutors is checkered, including the Ken Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton that came to be seen as political. “Historically special prosecutors go way beyond the scope” of duty, said Rick Tyler, a Republican strategist and former top adviser on Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. “McConnell’s staked out his ground, that’s just not gonna happen,” said Tyler, while allowing the possibility of an independent commission that could work in parallel to the FBI's work.

Picking Comey's successor

Democrats say the fact that Trump will appoint Comey’s successor is a clear indication that there is a conflict of interest and no choice but to put the matter to an independent counsel. Seeking to avoid that step, Republicans quickly ramped up their existing Senate-led investigation into Russia by issuing a subpoena for Flynn and sending a request to the Treasury Department’s financial crimes unit for any information on Trump and his top aides.

For Senate Democrats, whom Republicans need to pass any major legislation, that's not going far enough. “We are going hard on” demanding a special prosecutor, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. “It’s the only way,” she said, saying Trump has jeopardized the nation’s democracy by trying to control the nature of the FBI’s work.

Senate Democrats don’t have the votes to block Trump’s next FBI director. But they can inflict political pain by gumming up the works of the Senate, where Republicans need Democrats to pass major legislation, while continuing to pressure them back home.

“The constitutional crisis looming ahead of us if there is no special prosecutor, if the objectivity and independence of our justice system is imperiled, will be a barrier to accomplishing anything” in Congress, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee. “There is a fundamental question about the rule of law and the trust and credibility of this administration,” he said.

Particularly after Trump's hasty firing of Comey, there are parallels being drawn between the president’s Russia ties and the Watergate burglary investigation that felled former President Richard Nixon, who resigned from office after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment.

Yet during Watergate, Democrats controlled Congress, a big difference with the current controversy. Thomas A. Schwartz, a historian at Vanderbilt University, said it’s highly unlikely that a special counsel will be named in this moment. “It’s possible that Republican leaders like John McCain and Lindsey Graham could decide to break ranks with their party if public and political pressure ramped up considerably,” Schwartz says. “But unless there is significant public pressure to get a special counsel, Trump is probably safe,"" he said.

""If there are other major shoes to drop I think a lot of Republicans who may well now be on the fence could go in that direction,"" said Mike Allen, a former top aide in the George W. Bush administration. ""So far because Democrats have really made it the banner under which they are flying I think that instinctively makes some Republicans oppose it,"" he said. At least for now, ""it's a shirts versus skins thing.""

In the meantime, Democrats appear prepared to pursue a two-pronged strategy of applying pressure both in Congress and in the home districts and states of lawmakers. On Thursday, Perriello continued to pound Gillespie on Twitter. Perriello faces Lt. Gov. Ralph Northan in the June 13 primary to decide who will face Gillespie in November.

How about you put down the twitter and pick up a spine?



Russia is puppeteering our president and you won't make a peep. #WhatWouldReaganSayhttps://t.co/lbIjPdZAl4 — Tom Perriello (@tomperriello) May 11, 2017

In Congress, Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat, is meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan’s constituents on Friday at a United Auto Workers hall in Kenosha as part of a new initiative organized by progressives dubbed “adopt a district.” That's where Democrats meet with the constituents of neighboring Republicans. In southern Arizona on Wednesday, Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, held a town hall in the district of Rep. Martha McSally, a neighboring Republican, in which he hammered her on the Russia issue. In a statement, McSally has called Comey’s firing “deeply concerning” and said the investigations must be “completed without political interference.” That’s short of calling for a special prosecutor.

“She’s shown she does not have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump,” including “the investigation into the Russian collusion in our election system,” Gallego said in a conference call ahead of his visit.

Weaver, the former Republican campaign adviser, drew parallels between currently hesitant members of Congress and Republicans during Watergate, when a number of Republican senators initially opposed articles of impeachment against Nixon.

“There will be a point in our party that a Barry Goldwater or a Howard Baker will have to emerge that has the standing within the party that says this is too far. We cannot support it,"" said Weaver. “You would think it would be based on principle,"" he said, but unfortunately “there’s no interest like self-interest,” he said. “We’re getting there.”

While most of the sports world is making jokes about the Big Baller Brand shoes these days, one guy who isn't laughing is New Orleans Pelicans guard Jordan Crawford.

On his Twitter account Wednesday, Crawford told his followers that he bought a pair of the ZO2 shoes, the ones that start at $495 a pair.

Now apparently Crawford had only heard about the shoes before purchasing. He asked folks on Twitter to help him.

About an hour later, he let everyone know that he had bought a pair.

Crawford has bounced around the NBA since 2010 when, after being drafted by the New Jersey Nets, he was traded to the Atlanta Hawks on draft night. Then he was moved from the Hawks to the Washington Wizards on a trade deadline deal in his rookie season. At the 2013 trade deadline he was traded from Washington to the Boston Celtics, then Boston moved him to Golden State in January 2014. He was out of the league for the next two seasons and signed a contract with the Pelicans in March of this year.

He has averaged 12.3 points for his career with 3.2 assists.

According to ESPN's business reporter Darren Rovell, Crawford's shoes cost more than $495, because he ordered a size 14.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Trump, right, talks to Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin as Vice President Pence listens at the Oval Office in the White House, May 10, 2017. Trump said the U.S. supports Ukraine, Klimkin told USA TODAY. (Photo: Embassy of Ukraine)

WASHINGTON — Ukraine's foreign minister said he received assurances from President Trump and Vice President Pence of support from the United States, as Russia expands its influence in separatist-held eastern Ukraine.

In an interview with USA TODAY, Pavlo Klimkin said, ""Without U.S. engagement, it's not possible to sort this out, because Russia has respect for the United States.""

Klimkin’s visit to the White House Wednesday was overshadowed by Trump’s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Trump expressed his desire to work with Ukraine “to peacefully resolve the conflict,” the White House said in a statement. Pence emphasized that the negotiated cease-fire agreements “remain the most viable path toward peace.""

""It was very important to hear,"" Klimkin said. Russia's actions in eastern Ukraine are making peace harder to achieve, he added.

For example, Russian rubles must now be used as currency in the Donbas region, instead of Ukrainian hryvnas, for all transactions, including paying employees of Ukrainian companies. That mandate, in place since March 1, required transferring large amounts of currency from Russia, which Klimkin said could not have happened without Russian approval and involvement.

In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree Feb. 18 recognizing passports and other documents issued by the self-described People’s Republic of Donetsk and People’s Republic of Luhansk.

On March 17, separatist authorities seized private and Ukrainian state-owned factories and mines, he said. One result is that owners in Ukraine have no legal way to communicate with Ukrainian companies in the Donbas, Klimkin said. Commodities, such as coal and iron ore produced in the separatist-held areas, are being illegally transferred and sold in Russia, he said.

And, Klimkin said, Russian state-owned media and the separatist-held region also started “talking about ‘the nation of Donbas,’ which never existed.”

“It’s not a random sequence of actions,” he said. “It’s an intentional sequence to bring the occupied Donbas far, far away from Ukraine.”

The fighting in eastern Ukraine, which started after demonstrators ousted a pro-Russian government in February 2014, has escalated in recent months, despite cease-fire agreements negotiated with Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany in Minsk, Belarus. While Russia denies arming the separatists, Ukrainian, U.S. and other Western authorities have documented Russian military support and direct involvement in the conflict that has resulted in 10,000 Ukrainian deaths.

The U.S. and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Lavrov on Wednesday that U.S. sanctions won't be lifted until Russia reverses its actions.

The Minsk agreement requires the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the restoration of Ukrainian law in the separatist-held regions. The deal also calls for Ukraine to establish a ""special status"" for the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that includes self-governance and cross-border cooperation with Russia. While fighting continues, that special status provision will not be accepted or adopted by Ukraine, according to Oksana Syroid, deputy speaker of the Ukrainian parliament.

Ukrainians ""will not allow it,"" Syroid said last week in Washington. ""It's against human dignity.""

Klimkin said Russia maintains 6,000 military troops, 2,000 tanks and other heavy weapons in the separatist-held area of Ukraine. Unless the recent changes are reversed, he warned that the situation there will become permanent.

6,Poll: Majority of Americans don't think Comey firing was appropriate,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

A majority of Americans don't believe President Trump's sudden firing of James Comey was appropriate, according to a new poll.

The NBC News and SurveyMonkey online poll found that 54% of Americans believed Comey's dismissal was inappropriate, while 38% thought it was appropriate.

The poll was released the same day that Trump told NBC's Lester Holt that he had planned to fire Comey ""regardless of (the Justice Department's) recommendation.""

The White House had previously asserted that Comey was fired based on the recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who lambasted Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.

However, according to the survey, 46% of Americans believe that Comey was fired because he is overseeing an FBI investigation into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the presidential election.

A 24% faction believe it was because of the Clinton email investigation. Another 22% said the firing was because of something else.

Even though Americans are clearly suspicious of Trump's motives for firing Comey, they don't necessarily like the former FBI director. About 4 out of 10 Americans (44%) said they did not approve of how Comey did his job as FBI director. Only 25% said they approved, and another 28% said they didn't know enough to say.

Comey's recent tenure has been marked by two widely publicized probes – and he didn't get high approval ratings for how he handled either of them. Comey made the unusual decision of coming out in July to announce he was not recommending prosecution against Clinton for her use of a private email server during secretary of State, only to announce he was reopening the probe just 11 days before the November election.

The poll found Comey had a low, 19% approval rating for how he handled the Clinton email probe. Another 57% said they disapproved of his handling of that investigation.

Comey earlier this year announced the FBI was in the middle of a full blown counterintelligence investigation into whether there was any collusion between Russia and Trump campaign associates. Only 34% of Americans said they approved of how he was handling the Russia investigation, while 27% disapproved.

Still, following Comey's ouster, a majority of people (55%) said they were now less confident that the Russia investigation would be fairly conducted. Comparably, 36% said it made them more confident.

A majority of people (54%) said they believed that the alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials is a serious issue. Another 40% said it was more of a distraction.

The poll was conducted online from May 10 to May 11 among a national sample of 3,746 adults.

MOSCOW (AP) — Several activists were detained in Moscow on Thursday as they prepared to submit signatures they have collected to protest arbitrary detentions and torture of gay men in Chechnya.

The anti-gay abuse first was reported in April by the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which said about 100 suspected gay men were rounded up and tortured, and at least three were killed.

The Associated Press separately interviewed two Chechen men who spoke of torture and corroborated the reports.

LGBT activist Igor Yasin said five people were detained Thursday outside the Prosecutor General's Office as they brought about 2 million signatures to protest the treatment of gay people in the predominantly-Muslim region in Russia's south.

The New York-based civic group Avaaz, which helped collect the signatures worldwide, said in a statement that one of the people detained in the morning was an Italian activist.

Avaaz's campaign director, Bert Wander, described the detentions as a ""blatant attempt by Russia to intimidate those standing up for gay people (which) will only draw more global attention to the horrors unfolding in Chechnya.""

President Vladimir Putin last week assured the country's human rights ombudswoman that he would speak with law enforcement officials about the reported torture of gay men.

Tatyana Moskalkova, the ombudswoman, has asked for a task force to be formed to investigate the treatment of gays in Chechnya.

6,Trump put a voter ID hawk in charge of his 'Election Integrity' group,"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order chartering an investigation into alleged corruption in the American electoral system -- an institution he has repeatedly smeared with baseless charges of mass voter fraud.

But as much or more than the initiative itself, the early criticism has been trained on its designated point man, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach.

Opponents past and present responded with anger on Thursday as news of his involvement spread.

""Kris Kobach being named to run a commission on 'voter integrity' is like naming Bernie Madoff to run a commission on financial crimes,"" Frank Sharry, the founder and executive director of America's Voice, an immigrant group, said in a statement. ""His bigotry and radicalism have no place in our federal government. Any commission which Kobach leads has no integrity.""

Kobach, who consulted Trump during the transition, got his first taste of Washington during a stint as an immigration law adviser in the George W. Bush administration. In that role, he helped craft the the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), a post-9/11 program that required additional layers of screening for people entering the US from countries -- almost all in the Middle East -- believed to be home to known terror suspects.",cnn

Alison Krauss' first solo record in 18 years, Windy City, was inspired by two different sources: the photographs of Bob Richardson, and producer Buddy Cannon. She’d sung harmony on records Cannon produced for artists including Jamey Johnson, and realized that she wanted to make an album with him at the helm.

“We talked about only having songs that were older than me, but we ended up changing that when we figured out how old I was,” Krauss, 45, joked to The Tennessean. “Actually I thought it was more important that they all fit together. I think they did.”

A couple of their choices, like John Hartford’s Gentle on My Mind and the Cindy Walker/Eddy Arnold song You Don’t Know Me, are familiar to the casual country music listener. But the majority of songs Krauss and Cannon chose for Windy City are lesser-known gems, like River in the Rain, a Roger Miller-penned song for a Broadway musical about Huckleberry Finn.

9,Hall of Fame QB has an idea to make sure Deflategate never happens again | FOX Sports,"Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese has a pretty simple way of ensuring there won’t be a repeat of the Deflategate saga: just get rid of the rule regarding minimum air pressure in the footballs.

Griese believes that quarterbacks should have final say over how much air pressure should be in the balls, eliminating the need for another QB to go through the controversy that eventually led to the league suspending New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

“You know all this business about Deflategate and all that other stuff, what’s wrong with taking a little bit of air out of the ball and still making it legal?’’ Griese told Patriots.com. “It’s a passing league anyway. You want quarterbacks to be able to throw the ball in December when it gets colder and the ball gets slick, which it does, or in the rain when it gets slippery. Why not take a little air out of the ball? Lower the amount of air you can have in the ball, and if some quarterbacks like it harder, then you can pump it up a little. Change the degrees of error a little bit. It’s just a comfort level thing. The balls back when I played were a lot different than they are today, and I had small hands, so it was really a problem for me at times.’’

You can accuse Griese of just looking out for a fellow quarterback, but he’s also coming to the defense of a player who has tormented his former team – the Dolphins. Brady and the Patriots took legal action against the league in an attempt to avoid a suspension, but Brady eventually relented, announcing last July that he would not appeal his four-game suspension to the U.S. Supreme Court, ending the saga that lasted more than a year.",fox-sports

The Rosie O'Donnell-Donald Trump feud takes a new turn, with the firing of James Comey this week.

The president resurfaced a tweet O'Donnell sent out months ago.

""FIRE COMEY,"" the comedian and actress tweeted back in December. Her note came as a a reply to Brian Fallon, the press secretary for Hillary Clinton's campaign. Fallon had tweeted earlier that day that ""Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at the time.""

@pricklyeater@brianefallon - FIRE COMEY — ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20, 2016

President Trump retweeted O'Donnell on Thursday, with his own comments: ""We finally agree on something Rosie.""

We finally agree on something Rosie. https://t.co/BSP5F3PgbZ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2017

The two have feuded for years. Back in 2006, they sparred, with O'Donnell saying Trump was not a self-made man and Trump calling her a ""real loser.""

Fast forward to the last presidential cycle, and their fight became front and center of the political world. In August 2015, when debate moderator Megyn Kelly asked about the language he used to describe women — ""You’ve called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals"" — Trump quickly retorted, ""Only Rosie O'Donnell.""

A year later, Trump brought up O'Donnell again during a debate with Hillary Clinton: ""Somebody who has been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell, I said very tough things to her and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.""

O'Donnell remains a vocal critic of Trump's.

9,Joanna Jedrzejczyk wants to be a two-division champion just like Conor McGregor | FOX Sports,"The addition of the women’s flyweight division later this year has Joanna Jedrzejczyk contemplating a chance to make history sooner rather than later.

The reigning and defending women’s strawweight champion has flirted with the idea of moving up to 125 pounds previously but now that the UFC is set to crown the first ever champion in the division later this year, it’s now becoming a reality.

While Jedrzejczyk is laser focused on her title fight this weekend against Jessica Andrade at UFC 211, she can’t ignore the possibility of winning a second world title while joining Conor McGregor as the only simultaneous two division champions in UFC history.

“Maybe next year, I will fight for the second belt. Why not? It’s a big challenge, probably the challenge of my life. We will see,” Jedrzejczyk said on Thursday in Dallas.

Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

Of course, Jedrzejczyk expects to get the same blowback that McGregor received when he began serious pursuit of a second world title while already reigning as champion in a different division.

As McGregor went through two fights with Nate Diaz before finally facing Eddie Alvarez last November for the lightweight title, the featherweight division where he was also champion sat somewhat stagnant as contenders were all hoping for a shot at him.

Jedrzejczyk understands that argument, but she also wants to live out her dreams and goals and nothing would taste sweeter than becoming the first woman in UFC history to hold two titles at the same time.

“I remember when I was talking about this division a year ago people were like ‘focus on your belt’. I’m going for my fifth title defense. That’s the thing, why not? I have bigger, bigger goals and dreams. If I don’t win this second belt, nothing is going to happen because like I said, I already reached my goals and dreams, but there is something better coming,” Jedrzejczyk said.

“People were saying the same to Conor [McGregor] when he was saying he wants to be a king in two different divisions. Same with me. I just want to challenge myself and this is what I’m doing in my life.”

Of course, McGregor promised that he would eventually defend both titles but he never got the chance when the UFC stripped him of the featherweight belt less than a month after becoming a two division champion.

While she can’t predict the future, Jedrzejczyk believes she could stay busy and active enough to defend both titles if she’s fortunate enough to win a championship at 125 pounds.

“If I became a champion [at] 125, I will be jump between 115 and 125,” Jedrzejczyk said. “I want to be the real champion of two different divisions.”",fox-sports

Kushner Companies was courting investors for a New Jersey development called 1 Journal Square. Ethics watchdogs said Meyer appeared to be leveraging family ties to the White House to enrich the family business. The company later apologized.

Kushner Companies sought to attract real estate investors through a U.S. visa program called EB-5. It promises immigrants a path to a green card if they invest more than $500,000 in a project that creates jobs stateside. The program is frequently used by wealthy Chinese nationals.

Jared Kushner stepped away from the business to take a role in his father-in-law's administration. Kushner's lawyer Blake Roberts said last weekend that Kushner is not involved with his family's company.

Roberts also said Kushner sold his interests in the Journal Square project to a family trust.

The Kushner family's Chinese partner, an immigration firm called Qioawai, is heavily promoting the Journal Square project and its use of the EB-5 program on its website. Other Kushner properties are also featured on the website as examples of ""iconic"" projects.",cnn

Colin Kaepernick is still a quarterback without a job, but there apparently are still teams in the NFL that are curious about his prospects.

Harry Edwards, the renowned sociologist who has been an adviser to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, told USA TODAY Sports that three teams have contacted him about Kaepernick since the free agency period opened in March.

This, amid speculation that Kaepernick, 29, is being blackballed after igniting a movement last season when he protested police brutality and racial inequalities by refusing to stand for the national anthem.

“They’ve asked, ‘Can he play? Does he want to play?’ “ Edwards said. “The last question I can’t answer. The first question, absolutely. If Kaep makes up his mind, he wouldn’t only go in and make a team, he’d put pressure on somebody to start.”

MORE COVERAGE:

It is certainly baffling, from a football sense, that a man with a Super Bowl start on his resume hasn’t been offered as much as a backup slot in a league with a dearth of quarterback talent. Even Blaine Gabbert, who was benched last season when Kaepernick returned to the starting lineup, has a new job. Gabbert signed with the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday.

Kaepernick, meanwhile, hasn’t been publicly linked to any team. Although Kaepernick has been seen publicly while engaged in some charity causes during the offseason, he hasn’t commented on his football prospects. Edwards, also a consultant to the 49ers, wouldn’t reveal which teams contacted him and said that he hasn’t spoken to Kaepernick since he opted out of his San Francisco contract.

Is Kaepernick’s lack of opportunity essentially backlash for his protests?

“I don’t think there’s any question that there are some owners who wouldn’t have him in the league, much less on their team,” Edwards said. “But I fully expect one (team to sign him), because it’s in the best interest of the league to have him on a team.

“You can’t have a league that’s approaching 80% black, and then say it you stand up and say anything relevant to these issues – especially in the age of (President) Trump – this is what happens to you. You can’t do that. You can’t just up and right off black protests as if this were 1950.”

In March, ESPN reported that Kaepernick would resume standing for the anthem. Yet that apparently hardly moved the needle on his market appeal.

If he doesn’t wind up with a team, Edwards suggests that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell find a position for Kaepernick at league headquarters.

“I want to hear what he thinks and what he has to say about what’s going on in the league,” Edwards said.

Of course, the best-case scenario is to hear from Kaepernick while he also has the chance to demonstrate that he can still play in the NFL, too.

9,Yair Rodriguez explains why he can be a bigger star than Canelo Alvarez in Mexico | FOX Sports,"As the UFC continues to expand into Latin America, featherweight contender Yair Rodriguez would like to become the new face of the promotion in Mexico with hopes to even surpass Saul “Canelo” Alvarez as the biggest combat sports star in his home country.

Now that might sound like very lofty aspirations considering Alvarez has become one of the biggest sports stars in all of Mexico while also becoming a real draw for the sport of boxing.

Alvarez’s most recent fight against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. reportedly sold around one million pay-per-views, which is a massive landmark for the 26-year old Mexican boxer.

Now Rodriguez makes it clear that he has no ill will towards his fellow countryman whatsoever, but he still believes in the long term that he could become an even bigger draw for the Mexican faithful than what “Canelo” is currently pulling for his fights.

“He became a big star. Well why him being Mexican and being a fighter, can I not become a big star in Mexico? Why not? It doesn’t make any sense for me when people ask me,” Rodriguez explained when speaking to FOX Sports. “Why not?

“If I become a champion, if I become the first Mexican UFC champion, I can become bigger because I will be the first one. There are already a lot of Mexican boxers, great boxers. I’m not saying Canelo is not great. He’s great. But I think I can become bigger than that because I’ll be the first one.”

Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports

Lofty goals indeed for Rodriguez but there’s no lack of confidence in the surging featherweight star ahead of his next fight at UFC 211 this weekend.

To remain on his path to become the first ever Mexican born UFC champion, Rodriguez will have to get past Frankie Edgar on Saturday night and that’s no easy task.

Edgar has sat atop two divisions during different stages in his UFC career while currently being ranked No. 2 at featherweight sitting behind only champion Jose Aldo and interim champion Max Holloway. In fact, Edgar has only been defeated by Aldo since moving down to 145 pounds while racking up wins over every other fighter he’s faced including stoppages over Cub Swanson and Chad Mendes.

Despite that resume, Rodriguez not only believes that he can beat Edgar at UFC 211, but he wants to add another career first to his record as well.

He wants to be the first person to hand Edgar a loss by knockout.

“I think he’s never fought a guy like me,” Rodriguez said about Edgar. “Everybody thinks I’m fast, but they don’t know how fast I am until they fight me. Whenever they fight me, they can never find me. I think Frankie Edgar has the potential for me to knock him out because the way that he moves and he’s short. I like to fight short guys because my range helps me out a lot. So I think it’s just because of that.”

As much as the hype around this fight centers around Rodriguez taking a big step up in competition to face a former champion like Edgar, he refuses to acknowledge that this matchup is any tougher than the others he’s faced in the past.

It’s not that Rodriguez doesn’t see Edgar as a threat, but instead he prefers to focus on what he’s doing to get ready for the fight rather than putting any opponent on a pedestal.

“For me it’s just one more fight. With all respect to him, he’s just one more fight for me,” Rodriguez said. “I treated B.J. Penn the same, I treated Alex Caceres the same, I treat any fighter the same. It doesn’t matter. Because for me, they’re just a number. It doesn’t matter if you’re the champion or not. For me, that doesn’t matter. I’m going to treat you the same because you are a human being.

“You have a brain, you have a heart, you have two arms and two legs. You train just like me. It doesn’t matter where you think you are. I’m going to treat you the same.”",fox-sports
6,Could Trump have obstructed justice?,"Jimmy Gurulé is a law professor at Notre Dame and a former under secretary for enforcement at the US Department of the Treasury, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs, and assistant US attorney. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his.

President Trump's claims that this dismissal was justified based on Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal are curious, given that during the presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump enthusiastically praised and applauded Comey's decision to reopen the Clinton investigation -- after initially rebuking Clinton for her carelessness and concluding she had committed no crime. Back then, Donald Trump portrayed Comey's actions as a profile in courage. So what accounts for this sudden and dramatic change of opinion?

Ultimately, Comey may have been fired not because he wasn't doing a good job, as Trump claims, but because he was doing his job too well -- and that's bad news for the President, because it puts him within range of obstruction of justice charges. Evidence that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice could serve as the basis of impeachment proceedings.

Two significant events may explain this bizarre turn of events. First, grand jury subpoenas were recently served on associates of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, indicating the FBI investigation was aggressively moving forward. As a former federal prosecutor, I have conducted dozens of grand jury investigations and subpoenaing someone to testify is a serious matter. Witnesses testify under oath and knowingly making a material false statement could result in perjury charges. Moreover, witnesses are not subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury unless they are suspected of having knowledge or evidence of a crime. Obviously, this was not good news for the Trump administration, who desperately want to change the narrative and terminate the criminal investigation.

Second, days before his firing, Comey requested a significant increase in money and personnel to expand the scope of the FBI inquiry involving the Russians and Trump's campaign, according to news reports. The Justice Department denied this allegation. A request for additional resources would mean the FBI had identified significant evidentiary leads that needed to be investigated more fully. It seems likely the FBI investigation was proceeding forward with no end in sight.

If the President's real reason for firing Comey was to derail or obstruct the FBI investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and Trump associates to influence the outcome of the presidential election, this could warrant serious legal consequences. More specifically, Trump's actions could constitute obstruction of justice, a federal felony offense.

Most obstruction of justice charges are filed under the omnibus clauses of 18 U.S.C. § 1503 and § 1505 , where the government must prove that: (1) the defendant acted with ""corrupt"" intent (in this case, intent to interfere with or thwart the investigation); (2) the defendant endeavored to interfere with a pending judicial proceeding; (3) there was a sufficient ""nexus"" between the defendant's actions and the pending proceeding (the actions were likely to affect the judicial proceedings); and (4) the defendant acted with knowledge that the judicial proceedings were pending. Further, and most critically in this case, the defendant need not actually obstruct the pending judicial proceeding, but only ""endeavor"" to do so.

If you read the law and compare it to the events unfolding, it seems the actions of Donald Trump and his administration meet some of the required criteria. Trump fired Comey amid a pending grand jury investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and the Russians. Witnesses had been subpoenaed to appear before that grand jury. Further, Trump was likely aware of the pending grand jury proceedings, since he was constantly obsessed with the Russian investigation, and, by firing Comey, attempted to disrupt and interfere with those proceedings. Ultimately, the fundamental issue is whether Trump fired Comey with a ""corrupt"" intent, meaning to obstruct or impede the federal grand jury investigation. If so, President Trump committed a federal crime.

The firing of FBI Director Comey raises these and other serious legal questions that carry significant political implications.

3,Mexican who searched for 'disappeared' is killed,"Image copyright UN Mexico Image caption Miriam Rodriguez Martinez

A Mexican businesswoman who headed a group of 600 families searching for their disappeared relatives has been killed.

Miriam Rodriguez Martinez was shot in her home in the town of San Fernando in Tamaulipas state.

She was known for successfully investigating the kidnap and murder of her daughter by a local drug cartel, the Zetas.

The information she gave the police ensured the gang members were jailed.

But in March one of them escaped and her colleagues said she started to receive threats.

Her colleagues said she had asked for police protection but was ignored.

The Mexican human rights commission issued a statement saying it deplored her murder and called for a full investigation.

Image copyright Photoshot Image caption The UN in Mexico tweeted its condemnation of the murder

Mrs Rodriguez founded the local collective in her town for families who were victims of violence after her daughter was kidnapped in 2012.

She had managed to find her daughter's body in a clandestine grave and put her murderers in jail.

She also foiled an attempted kidnapping by the Zetas of her husband, when she chased the gang in her car, at the same time notifying the army who then managed to arrest them.

The group she established was part of a wider trend which mushroomed after the October 2014 disappearance of 43 rural student teachers studying at Ayotzinapa in the southwestern state of Guerrero.

Frustrated by a lack of government help, groups of families began their own searches for people who had disappeared in their areas, taking courses in forensic anthropology, archaeology, law, buying caving equipment and becoming experts in identifying graves and bones.

There are now at least 13 of these groups across the country.

3,Copenhagen imam accused of calling for killing of Jews,"Image copyright MEMRI Image caption Denmark's immigration minister called Mundhir Abdallah's sermon ""completely preposterous""

A video of an imam appearing to call for the murder of Jews in a sermon during Friday prayers at a Copenhagen mosque has caused outrage in Denmark.

Mundhir Abdallah was reported to police after being filmed citing in Arabic a hadith - a teaching of the Prophet Muhammad - considered anti-Semitic.

The hadith says the Day of Judgement ""will not come unless the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them"".

A Jewish community leader said his words were a ""thinly-veiled"" threat.

Videos of the sermon were posted on YouTube and Facebook by the Al-Faruq Mosque on Sunday, although Mr Abdallah reportedly gave it on 31 March.

A part of the 30-minute address was later translated by the Washington-based Middle East Media Research Institute (Memri).

In the video, Mr Abdallah is seen standing in front of a black flag with the Shahadah written on it, similar to those used by jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda.

He declares there will soon be a ""caliphate"" - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia - that will wage jihad to unite the Muslim community and liberate the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem ""from the filth of the Zionists"".

Then, he says, ""the words of the Prophet Muhammad will be fulfilled"" and cites the hadith.

Jewish community leader Dan Rosenberg told the Politiken newspaper: ""We are concerned weak and impressionable people may perceive this kind of preaching as a clear call to violence and terror against Jews.""

Immigration and Integration Minister Inger Stojberg also expressed outrage.

10,TCL eyes the throne as one of the world's top TV makers,"“It can be overwhelming to walk into a retailer and see all the TVs on the wall. All their settings are cranked up to compete with one another,” Chris Larson, Senior Vice President, TCL tells us at a recent briefing held at Dolby Labs in San Francisco, Calif.

The discussion was about how TCL TVs … well, all TVs really, are calibrated differently for stores than they are for your home. It’s a trick TV manufacturers have been using for years – turning saturation levels up to sickening levels while cranking the brightness up to its maximum level. It’s intense, definitely, and more than a little deceitful.

But let’s not focus on that god-awful practice for a minute. Let’s focus on the wall of TVs.

For anyone who knows the difference between a composite and component cable, this wall is a visual chocolate factory – each television offering a different flavor of eye candy. We love walking into a Best Buy or Tesco to see what’s new in the world of pixels and panels. We comment on how this LG OLED might look better than Samsung’s new QLED screen, at least in terms of contrast, and quibble over whether Android TV is the best or the worst thing to ever happen to televisions in the last century.

But for others, like my parents, this section of the store – and in particular this wall of TVs – is nothing but a bunch of seemingly identical screens. Who makes a better OLED really isn’t on their list of concerns. I’ve tried to explain Quantum Dot, Dolby Vision, HDR and dozens of other technologies over the years to my parents and, honestly, they’re not interested. As long as the TV looks good and doesn’t cost much, they’re happy.

If you want to know how TCL (an acronym that at one point stood for True China Lion) became the third largest TV manufacturer in the world, it’s through people like my parents.

Quality, performance and value

Sorry, that last bit makes it sound like TCL doesn’t make very good TVs. They do. I mean, they’re not exceptional in the same way the LG Signature Series W7 OLED or the Samsung Q9F QLED TV are, but they’re quite good – especially now that they support Dolby Vision.

The reason for my visit to Dolby Labs was to check out TCL’s 2017 line-up. Two series from last year are getting a refresh (the P- and S-Series) while TCL is introducing a completely new line called the C-Series that taps into contemporary aesthetics and adds support for most HDR sources.

These TVs look good and, according to Larson, will also be priced fairly. If you’re looking for a way to help differentiate TCL from the masses of TVs on the aforementioned wall, it’s their brand promise: Delivering uncompromised experiences at a recognized value with an attractive cosmetic.

It’s a promise that seems to be harder and harder to keep every year now that new Chinese TV makers like Hisense and LeEco have moved into the market. To me, this seems like something worth fretting over, but it didn’t seem to scare anyone in that office.

Oprah might give away cars, but Ellen's got TVs covered.

Larsen told me there were already branding programs in place to help make TCL a household name. “We have a partnership with the Ellen Show and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Plus, we acquired the TCL Chinese Theater down in L.A.” Other ties include UCLA athletic teams, the San Jose Earthquakes (a MLS team based in Northern California) and the Rose Bowl, one of the biggest football games in the NCAA.

And while the list is impressive, I’m not sure a few sponsorship deals will be enough to beat out the most ubiquitous names in television like Sony, Samsung and LG – each of whom have a long and storied career in American families’ living rooms. But maybe it will be.

The grand plan

So what’s the end goal here? If TCL got this far in the TV world without an insane amount of brand recognition, why does it want to change anything?

According to Larsen, it's easy to sell smaller value TVs. It’s a crowded market, sure, but in the end value always beats out performance. But being the main screen in the house? That’s much, much harder. To get to the coveted center of the home you’ve not only got to look good in terms of picture quality and cost less than everyone else, but you need a decent design aesthetic, too.

And according to Aaron Dew, Director of Product Development at TCL, that’s where this year’s all new C-Series come in.

The new series will go on sale in late June and combines “contemporary design” (Dew’s words) and the latest in 4K HDR technology. As far as operating systems go, the TVs use Roku OS 7.5 – a close relative of the operating system used on Roku streaming boxes like the Roku Ultra, Roku Premiere+ and Roku Express.

The C-Series will come in 55-, 65- and 75-inch versions and will include both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. (HLG is something TCL is looking into, but not actively including on any TV this year.) They'll feature wide color gamut with advanced LED phosphor for more realistic colors, brighter highlights and increased light-to-dark contrast and support almost 100% of the DCI-P3 color space.

I left the demo impressed with what I saw. The Dolby Vision integration helped add some pizzazz to TCL’s panels, while Roku OS provided a familiar face that I knew could help me find the content I’ve been looking for.

And yet, I couldn’t help but think back to that wall.

When TCL’s latest series make it to showrooms in late June, will my parents be blown away by Dolby Vision? Will they care that the 2017 P-Series now has 72 Contrast Control Zones that increase contrast and clarity? Maybe. Maybe not.

But considering that TCL’s 55-inch C-Series TV, the 55C807, goes for $699 (around £540, AU$950), I guess it doesn’t matter.",techradar
6,OnPolitics Today: Trump contradicted himself on the Comey firing,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump said FBI Director James Comey was fired because of the Clinton email investigation but later contradicted himself. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

Two days. That's how long it took for President Donald Trump to upend his own administration's rationale behind the firing of FBI Director James Comey, the fallout from which continued to engulf Washington on Thursday.

In a letter Trump sent to Comey on Tuesday, the president wrote that he fired the director based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. But in an interview Thursday with NBC's Lester Holt, Trump claimed that Sessions and Rosenstein didn't influence his decision at all. Trump had already made up his mind.

""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" said Trump, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander.""

It's OnPolitics Today, the new daily politics roundup from USA TODAY. Subscribe here.

Some key folks disagree with Trump's characterization of Comey

Trump said this week that he fired Comey because he was ""not doing a good job,"" telling Holt in his Thursday interview that ""the FBI has been in turmoil.""

You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that,"" Trump said. ""You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago, it hasn't recovered from that.""

Except everyone does not know that, including Andrew McCabe, the FBI's new acting director. The White House said this week that Comey had lost the confidence of the bureau, a claim McCabe contradicted on Thursday when speaking to a Senate committee. “The vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,” McCabe said, which continues ""to this day.""

The firing of Comey, McCabe said, would not deter the FBI's investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia: ""Simply put, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing.""

Republican Richard Burr, the North Carolina senator chairing the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Comey "" the most ethical, upstanding individual I’ve had the pleasure to work with.""

And, for what it's worth, a new online poll from NBC News found that a slight majority of Americans — 54% — don't think Comey's sudden firing was appropriate.

So about Rod Rosenstein

The deputy attorney general is getting an invite from senators to brief them about his role in Comey's firing. According to Politico, Rosenstein reached out to Senate Intelligence Committee leaders about meeting amid reports that he was ""furious"" about the White House's characterization of his recommendation that allegedly caused Comey's firing.

Democrat and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer asked Rosenstein more than two dozen questions in a letter on Thursday, including whether Comeys' firing came days after he asked for more resources for the FBI's Russia inquiry, as has been widely reported.

The all-senators briefing with Rosentein is slated for next week, according to a spokesman Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Russia reportedly tricked Trump's White House

Optics be damned, Trump met with top Russian diplomats on Wednesday, the day after firing the man overseeing the FBI's investigation into his own campaign and Russia. In a move both surprising and not, all media was barred from the meeting except one Russia-owned news agency. Photos soon surfaced of a beaming Donald Trump with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the man who's caused much of Trump's Russia-related headaches through his communications with Trump associates, including now-fired adviser Michael Flynn.

CNN reported Thursday that the White House is furious over release of the photos, claiming the Russians ""tricked us.""

The New Yorker, long been known for its comedic covers that flirt with controversy, is taking on the firing of FBI Director James Comey and in the process comparing it to the outrage-inspiring story of the man who was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight.

The cover for the May 22 issue of the magazine shows a complacent Comey being dragged down the aisle of a plane by Attorney General Jeff Sessions who is wearing a police uniform. Looking over his shoulder is the plane's captain, President Trump.

""It’s probably a bit of a leap,"" said artist Barry Blitt about his drawing for the cover, which is titled Ejected. ""James Comey is six feet eight — he probably would have been happy to give up his seat in a cramped cabin.""

An early look at next week's cover, “Ejected,” by Barry Blitt: https://t.co/HJUOYaH8qkpic.twitter.com/kCAqsAOUn5 — The New Yorker (@NewYorker) May 11, 2017

The cover instantly evokes the April 9 incident in which David Dao, a Louisville, Ky., doctor, refused to give up his seat on United flight after being involuntarily bumped. Police yanked Dao from his seat and dragged him off the plane, giving him a concussion and two lost teeth in the process.

Both the United incident and the Comey firing sparked waves of public outrage. It remains to be seen if the outcry over Comey will prove as ephemeral as that which followed Dao's rough removal.

6,"Trump gets 2 scoops of ice cream, everyone else gets 1","According to an extensive interview with TIME Magazine , Trump's White House staff has settled into Trump's routine and know his desires, sometimes before he does,

For example: Trump takes two scoops of ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, TIME reported, while everyone else around the table gets just one.

In the interview published Thursday, Trump also expanded on his view of Russian hacking during the 2016 election, refuted reports that he is unhappy with his current national security adviser and took a level of blame for his combative administration.

But, more than anything, Trump gave TIME a window into some of the oddities that make his White House unlike any in modern history, including the traits that make Trump tick.

Here are some illuminating takeaways from the interview:

Business at any cost

Trump casts himself throughout the interview as America's businessman, someone who is bringing his private-sector savvy to the White House to spur growth and create jobs. That focus extends to faulty digital launching systems on aircraft carriers -- ""Time and material means you're going to get your ass kicked"" -- to arms deals with unlikely African leaders.

TIME reported that Trump brought up how he is trying to mint an arms deal with an African leader who has decades-old human rights concerns, all in the name of spurring American business. Trump declined to name the country.

'It could be my fault'

Trump rarely takes blame, and throughout the 2016 campaign he said he rarely, if ever, apologizes.

But during his interview with TIME, Trump took responsibility -- sort of -- for the combative tone of his administration.

""It could be my fault,"" he said. ""I don't want to necessarily blame, but there's a great meanness out there that I'm surprised at.""

It's not an admission, but it's a close as Trump usually gets.

""I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong,"" Trump told Jimmy Fallon in September 2015. ""I will absolutely apologize sometime in the distant future if I'm ever wrong.""

A level of introspection

Trump, carrying on the tenor of his vicious 2016 campaign, has made Washington a more acrimonious place. Democrats, appalled by his victory, have grown more fearful, more vocal and more disgusted. Trump has kept his foot on the gas, too, with near constant combative tweets.

But doing the TIME interview, as their dinner was wrapping up, Trump appeared to have a moment of introspection.

""It never made sense to me, the level of animosity,"" Trump said. ""All you want to do is, like, let's have a great military. Let's have low taxes. Let's have good health care. Let's have good education.""

Trump, notably, at times during the 2016 campaign demeaned his primary and general election opponents' spouses and attacked a Gold Star family. More recently, he cast the entire media as the ""enemy of the state.""

'Choke like dogs'

Can Trump lament acrimony in Washington? Yes. But he also can elevate with seven-word sentence.

Watching clips of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates' recent Senate testimony, Trump compared to the longtime government officials to dogs.

""Watch them start to choke like dogs,"" Trump said after Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, asked whether official asked for names of Trump or his associates be revealed in an intelligence report. ""Watch what happens. They are desperate for breath.""

""Ah, he's choking. Ah, look,"" Trump said after Clapper declined to provide names.

""So they surveilled me,"" he added. ""You guys don't write that -- wiretapped in quotes. They surveilled me.""",cnn

Spoiler alert: This story contains significant details from Thursday's episode of The Big Bang Theory.

For someone who often seems immune to basic human emotions, Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) showed impressive dramatic flair with his marriage proposal in Thursday’s Season 10 finale of The Big Bang Theory.

The socially awkward genius impulsively flew from California to New Jersey to drop to his knee and offer an engagement ring to girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), who had just started a fellowship at Princeton. In true cliffhanger mode, fans will have to wait until fall to find out Amy’s answer.

Sheldon has had the ring and thoughts of marriage for some time, but it's a romantic kiss from a returning admirer, Dr. Ramona Nowitzki (Riki Lindhome), that compels him to act. He immediately leaves the office, heads to the airport, flies across the country and proposes as Amy opens her apartment door.

“We like to end the season finales on something intriguing, and we found ourselves enjoying the idea that while Amy was away another woman made a play for Sheldon,” says executive producer Steven Molaro. “Those pieces started to fit together.

“The season finale is a real pivotal moment for Sheldon and Amy,” he says. “When we shot that (proposal) scene, everybody was on stage, (including) the actors who weren’t in the scene. It was emotionally important for us to be part of it. And the studio audience just lost their minds.”

Parsons says he was surprised — but not completely — when he read the scene in the script. Sheldon has been advancing, slowly but surely, over the seasons: dating Amy, entering a committed relationship and losing his virginity with her. This season, they started living together.

Parsons spoke with Bialik about Sheldon’s motivation in proposing.

“The way it was instigated through this woman who came back into his life, there’s something very interesting that he was motivated by that,” he says. “He didn’t need a reminder that he missed (Amy). … Both of us wondered if he wasn’t trying to squash some weird feeling that he was uncomfortable with.”

Molaro, the top-rated sitcom’s head writer, says he’s not fully locked in on how Amy will respond when Bang returns for an eleventh season in the fall.

“On paper, it makes sense that she would say yes, but it’s a little complicated,” he says. “I have versions of the answer that are playing out in my head for us to talk about in the writers room. I think it’s good for a show when we pull the trigger on these momentous events even when we don’t know if we’re fully ready for it. It keeps it exciting.”

Parsons, like Sheldon, awaits Amy’s answer.

“I will be curious to see where it heads. This could be pretty straightforward,” he muses, before pausing. “Well, that’s not going to be true. Even if they go through with the wedding, there will be something weird about it.”

3,Arctic summit: Trump to make 'right decision for the US' on climate,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's James Cook explains why the Arctic Circle summit in Alaska matters

The US will consider its interests first as it reviews its climate change policy, the secretary of state says.

Rex Tillerson told a meeting of the eight Arctic nations in Alaska that the US would not rush to make a decision and would consider their views.

President Donald Trump has expressed doubts over the human role in climate change and has said he may pull the US out of the Paris Accord to fight it.

Meanwhile, other Arctic countries have called for a cut on greenhouse gases.

They signed an agreement which stated there was a need for urgent global action.

Climate change was the biggest issue at the biennial meeting of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks, which was overshadowed by the uncertainties over Mr Trump's policy.

Mr Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, told the meeting that the administration was reviewing how it would approach climate change.

Image caption Climate campaigners fear US policy will damage attempts to combat climate change

""We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view, and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns,"" he said.

""We're not going to rush to make a decision. We're going to work to make the right decision for the United States.""

Mr Trump is to decide whether the US will leave or reduce its commitments to the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which was negotiated by around 200 nations and signed in 2015.

An announcement is expected after a trip to Europe later this month.

The joint agreement by the Arctic Council mentioned the Paris accord only in a passing reference, which noted the deal's entry into force and implementation.

But the text did not recommit its members to meet the pledges made.

Reading between the lines: By James Cook, BBC News, Fairbanks, Alaska

Some climate scientists here in Alaska say they are pleasantly surprised by the relatively tough language on climate change adopted by all eight Arctic Council nations including the United States.

The thrust of the text, argues Prof John Walsh, chief scientist at the University of Alaska's International Arctic Research Center, actually echoes the approach of the Obama administration.

The acceptance of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gases (such as methane and carbon dioxide) and pollutants (like black carbon and aerosols) appears significant.

But a couple of things are missing. Although the logic of the statement insists that human activity is causing climate change, the word ""human"" is not actually present. Nor is there a commitment to implement the landmark Paris accord, an omission which is causing alarm among environmentalists.

Not only that, but many of the Trump administration's early policy decisions prioritised economic growth over environmental protection, and Mr Tillerson continues to insist that American climate policy remains under review.

So, in short, it is far too early to conclude that the White House has suddenly been persuaded by mainstream scientific opinion on global warming - and with US politics in astonishing flux, the Fairbanks Declaration may be no more than a holding statement.",bbc-news
9,How to fix the Houston Rockets in 3 easy steps | FOX Sports,"Year One of the Mike D'Antoni era in Houston went better than anyone expected, but the Rockets' impressive 2016-17 season came to an ignoble end in Game 6 against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday.

Without Kawhi Leonard on the floor to check James Harden, Houston still rolled over and lost by 39 points at home in an elimination game.

While it wasn't the greatest way to go out this season, the Rockets can take solace in the fact they're a team on the rise. They don't need to make any earth-shaking adjustments; they just need to trust their process and make a few changes to turn the modern version of D'Antoni's Suns into a team that can compete for a title.

Here are three ways the Rockets can improve this offseason.",fox-sports
9,Spurs embarrass Rockets by 39 points without Kawhi Leonard in Game 6 closeout win | FOX Sports,"That’s right: 39 points.

There was always the chance for a blowout when the San Antonio Spurs decided to sit Kawhi Leonard for Game 6 against the Houston Rockets. We just didn’t expect the Spurs to be the team delivering the thrashing.

Thanks to one of the worst nights of James Harden’s career and a much-needed big game from LaMarcus Aldridge, though, the Spurs eliminated the Rockets from the 2017 NBA playoffs with a 114-75 beatdown.

This pretty much sums up the night in Houston. #SCtop10 pic.twitter.com/OWKfaLekhS — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) May 12, 2017

Aldridge finished with 34 points on 16-for-26 shooting and 12 rebounds, while Jonathon Simmons added 18 points and four assists for San Antonio. Harden went 2-for-11 from the field, scoring 11 points and dishing seven assists in an embarrassing loss that had many questioning his MVP credentials.

The defeat is particularly irksome for Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni, who is now 5-20 in the postseason against Popovich, having lost all five series between the two.

Leonard missed Game 6 due to an ankle injury he suffered in the second half of San Antonio’s overtime Game 5 victory, as the Spurs had the luxury of a potential Game 7 at home on Sunday if they lost on Thursday night.

Instead, San Antonio will tip off the Western Conference finals against the Golden State Warriors, who swept their second-round series against the Utah Jazz, on Sunday in Oakland.",fox-sports

Mike D’Antoni is a realist.

So when the Houston Rockets head coach took a step back to evaluate this Western Conference Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs, he wasn’t afraid to speak some truth.

“It could be said that (the Spurs) should win,” D’Antoni told USA TODAY Sports last week before Game 3. “They’re better than us right now. We’re a little bit ahead in our progression.”

Except for one thing: He said that when Kawhi Leonard was actually playing.

The Leonard-less Spurs handed the Rockets a humiliating end to their surprise season on Thursday night at the Toyota Center, closing out the series with a 114-75 win that pits them against the vaunted Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals that will start on Sunday. With Leonard sidelined by a left ankle injury suffered in Game 5, his much-maligned co-star, 31-year-old forward LaMarcus Aldridge, had just the sort of game the Spurs had in mind when they added him in free agency in the summer of 2015.

""He's been like that through these first two rounds,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said after the win. ""He's really turned it on and demanded the ball.""

Latest NBA coverage:

The final inspired line: 34 points on 16 of 26 shooting to go with 12 rebounds. It was Aldridge’s best offensive game since May 2, 2016 when he scored 41 points in a playoff win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. More than that, it was the latest reminder that the Spurs aren’t going away anytime soon.

They lost Tim Duncan to retirement last summer, then saw veteran point guard Tony Parker go down with a season-ending quadriceps tendon tear in Game 2. The lone remaining member of their old-school trio, 39-year-old Manu Ginobili, pulled off a vintage performance in Game 5 that brought them to this point.

One game after his game-saving block on James Harden, with Harden himself having a disastrous finish (10 points on two of 10 shooting, seven assists, three rebounds, and six turnovers), the Spurs turned to their younger crew. Rookie point guard DeJounte Murray gave them 11 points, 10 rebounds and five assists off the bench (good for a plus-33 mark). Jonathon Simmons, the 27-year-old point guard who played his way to the Spurs through the NBA Development League, added 18 points on eight of 12 shooting.

""It happens,"" D'Antoni said. ""I just told the guys, they had an unbelievable year. ... We'll figure that out and get better this summer and then come back and do it again. It was a pleasure coaching them. They tried to do everything they could to make it a great year. I'm proud to be their coach. I know they feel as bad as I do.""

It would have been one thing for the Rockets to fall in this series with both sides at full strength, a respectable finish after their surprise campaign in which they had the league’s third-best record just one season after sneaking into the playoffs as the Western Conference’s eighth seed. After all, only the Warriors were better than the Spurs (61-21) this season. But this? It was as bad as season-ending exits get.

WASHINGTON — Political parties and independent groups have unleashed more than $20 million in federal races so far this year, in an early preview of the massive spending that will buffet the 2018 midterm contests for the House.

The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., tops the organizations active in early races. The group has reported already spending more than $5 million to protect Republican-held House seats in three elections this year, a USA TODAY tally of Federal Election Commission records shows.

Corry Bliss, the super PAC’s executive director, predicts the group will spend a total of $8.6 million on two fast-approaching special elections: the May 25 contest to fill an open House seat in Montana and the June 20 election for the suburban Atlanta seat vacated by House and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. The Georgia race, now down to a runoff between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel, already is on track to be the nation’s most expensive House contest.

The leadership fund is looking ahead to the 2018 midterms when all 435 House members are up for re-election and has committed to spending $100 million for those elections — twice its 2016 budget.

Officials also plan to open between 20 and 30 field offices in competitive House races around the country. It’s the first time that the super PAC, which can raise unlimited sums, has added a voter-turnout operation to its election arsenal and a sign of the midterm's high stakes for the party.

“We are just getting warmed up,” Bliss said of the group’s aggressive efforts in special elections.

The president’s party generally loses ground in midterm elections, and Republicans are moving early to protect their majority in the House. Democrats need 24 seats to retake the chamber and hope they can capitalize on President Trump’s near-record unpopularity and a contentious vote this month in the House to repeal the Affordable Care Act to nab seats from Republicans. Democrats view the upcoming special elections as an early test of party strength.

“The enthusiasm here is off the charts,” Nancy Keenan, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, said of the race for the state’s at-large House seat.

The seat had been held by Republicans for two decades, and the GOP nominee Greg Gianforte, who ran unsuccessfully for governor last year, is considered the favorite. But recent polls show a tightening race. And the Democratic nominee, musician Rob Quist, recently raised more $500,000 in just four days, Keenan said.

Quist and Gianforte also face Libertarian Mark Wicks in the election to fill the seat vacated by former Montana congressman and current Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.

Democrats face a steep climb in a rural state that Trump won by nearly 21 points last year. In one sign of the race's importance, however, Vice President Pence is set to stump for Gianforte on Friday in Billings, Mont. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has pledged to campaign for Quist.

Seat once held by Newt Gingrich

Democrats and Republicans, however, are training most of their firepower on the special election that is still more than a month away in Georgia. Ossoff, a 30-year-old former congressional aide and documentary filmmaker, has raised big sums in his quest for a seat once held by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

Ossoff collected an eye-popping $8.3 million ahead of the first round of voting in mid-April. He has not yet released fundraising totals for next month’s runoff with Handel. But Ossoff’s campaign said he took in $500,000 on April 19, the day after his first-place finish in the April 18 special election.

He received 48.1% of that vote, just shy of the 50% needed to capture the seat outright. That forced the June 20 runoff with Handel, the top Republican vote-getter.

The Congressional Leadership Fund spent $3 million in the first round of the Georgia special election and will spend another $3.5 million by Election Day, Bliss said. The super PAC is testing its new field operation in the race, deploying 90 full-time door knockers with the goal of talking to 200,000 additional voters.

Ossoff’s team also has assembled a big get-out-the-vote operation of its own, with 150 people working in six field offices, according to his aides.The campaign's staff and volunteers had knocked on more than 250,000 doors ahead of the April 18 primary alone, they said.

The super PAC has sought to cast Ossoff as out of step with Georgians and more in line with national Democratic figures, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.

Republicans also have targeted him for living outside the district he hopes to represent. Ossoff has said he and his fiancée Alisha Kramer are temporarily living closer to Atlanta’s Emory University, where she is a medical student.

Handel, a former county commissioner, “has lived and worked and accomplished in the district for years and years,” Bliss said. “The only thing Jon Ossoff ever did in the district was be born to really rich parents.”

Ossoff “knows the district; he grew up in the district, and he’s extremely familiar with the issues,” countered his spokeswoman Sacha Haworth.

Ossofff’s team contends that the leadership fund represents the real outsiders in the race.

Although super PACs have to disclose donors’ identities, $3.5 million of the nearly $4.5 million the Congressional Leadership Fund reported raising through March 29 came from its nonprofit arm, the American Action Network, Federal Election Commission records show. The network does not identify its donors.

That shows that Republicans are relying ""on anonymous donations of dark money"" in their fight to keep the seat, Haworth said.

Nicole Kidman is one tough food critic, not afraid to tell you when your pizza just isn't cutting it. She'll even spit it out, on live television.

Both Kidman and Ellen DeGeneres had a tough time chewing through celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis' clementine and fennel focaccia bread pizza during a cooking demonstration on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday.

As Ellen soldiered on during the tasting, chomping on the hard bread, Kidman vocalized her thoughts, before literally taking the pizza out of her mouth.

""It's a little tough. I know you're not meant to criticize. But it's a little tough,"" said Kidman, ""Don't let my kids see I did that.""

The site almost caused DeGeneres to choke on her food.

A laughing De Laurentiis pointed out, ""It's been sitting there for like five hours.""

The Ellen cooking demonstration is classic television. De Laurentiis, promoting her 13th season of Food Network Star, started off the segment teaching the duo how to make arancini balls out of leftover risotto. That brings about a flurry of ""ball"" double-entendres.

The trio laughed it up all the while as an Ellen producer kept urging them to move along.

""Isn't it meant to be relaxing?"" Kidman said at one point.

16,‘Purge’ killer given 3 life sentences,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A killer who said he was inspired by the ""Purge"" movies, was sentenced to three life sentences after a three-day rampage in May 2016 that led to the murder of three Indianapolis men. Dwight Adams/IndyStar

Johnathan Cruz (Photo: Provided by IMPD)

INDIANAPOLIS — Billy Boyd was killed one year ago Friday, as he walked home to care for his father with prostate cancer, his family says. He did not live to see the birth of his first grandchild. His father died shortly after him.

Three days later, Jose Ruiz was shot and killed. His daughter still has nightmares, his niece testified. His 18-year-old son has put off going to college.

""You could always call Billy in the middle of the night,"" his sister, Jennifer Darby, testified Thursday afternoon at the sentencing for her brother's killer, wiping away tears

Family members for 44-year-old Ruiz, 54-year-old Boyd and 40-year-old Jay Higginbotham crowded into the courtroom, sharing their pain and grief in the wake of the senseless rampage committed last year in the name of the horror film The Purge.

Marion Superior Judge Sheila Carlisle sentenced Johnathan S. Cruz, 20, of Indianapolis to three consecutive life sentences without parole for shooting and killing the three men in a three-day span last May. She also sentenced him to 16 years in prison for robbery, which will be served alongside the life sentences.

Cruz previously faced three murder charges and a slew of robbery, intimidation and gun charges. Marion County prosecutors in July notified the court the state would seek the death penalty in the case due to the allegation that Cruz killed three people in the commission of a robbery.

Last month, Cruz pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and one count of robbery. In exchange, prosecutors dropped the other charges and agreed not to pursue the death penalty.

Susan Leon, a niece of Ruiz, said her uncle was a father, husband, friend and godfather to many.

""If you needed anything, you could turn to him,"" she said.

“We see things every week that are difficult to comprehend. We've never seen this.” Terry Curry, Marion County prosecutor

Family members of Higginbotham declined to speak at the hearing, but noted for the court that they approved of the plea agreement.

After the hearing, Darby said many members of her family supported a life sentence from the beginning. She said she does not believe in the death penalty.

Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said his office took into account the defendant's possible mental health problems when considering the plea agreement.

""This individual spending the rest of his life in prison is gratifying,"" Curry said. ""He is 20 years old. His life is effectively over.""

The killing spree, according to court documents, was modeled after the horror film in which the U.S. government designates a 12-hour period where all crimes, including murder, are legal.

To witnesses, Cruz described his violent spree as a ""purge,"" court documents say. Investigators believed it was related to criminal gang activity.

""We see things every week that are difficult to comprehend,"" Curry said. ""We've never seen this.""

6,Timeline: Trump's words contradict White House answers on Comey firing,"Trump told NBC News on Thursday that he was going to fire Comey with or without Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's memo criticizing the director.

That statement contradicts at least 10 times Trump's top aides and advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, tried to explain the how and the why the President decided to sack Comey. Tuesday's unceremonious move came amid the FBI's probe into Russia's role in the 2016 election and any connections the Trump campaign had to the hackers.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation,"" Trump told NBC. He added: ""(Rosenstein) made a recommendation ... He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.""

That was not the story Pence told reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

""President Trump made the right decision at the right time to accept the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney General,"" Pence said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said her answers ""went off that information that I had when I answered your question.""

At the time, she said, she ""hadn't had a chance"" to ask the President directly, despite having numerous conversations with him. Sanders also claimed the White House story had been ""consistent,"" despite the clear inconsistencies.

Here is a list of comments by White House staff and the vice president that were contradicted by Trump's Thursday interview:

The FBI is investigating possible Trump campaign connections to Russia's election hacking

(CNN) President Donald Trump said Thursday that he feared his firing of FBI Director James Comey could confuse Americans, but went ahead with the plan anyway.

""When I did this now I said, I probably, maybe will confuse people,"" Trump told NBC News.

But he said he did it anyway ""to do the right thing for the American people.""

Trump said he wanted the FBI's investigation into Russia's election meddling to be ""absolutely done properly.""

He said Comey's firing might ""lengthen out the investigation.""

6,Could Trump have obstructed justice?,"Jimmy Gurulé is a law professor at Notre Dame and a former under secretary for enforcement at the US Department of the Treasury, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs, and assistant US attorney. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his.

President Trump's claims that this dismissal was justified based on Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal are curious, given that during the presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump enthusiastically praised and applauded Comey's decision to reopen the Clinton investigation -- after initially rebuking Clinton for her carelessness and concluding she had committed no crime. Back then, Donald Trump portrayed Comey's actions as a profile in courage. So what accounts for this sudden and dramatic change of opinion?

Ultimately, Comey may have been fired not because he wasn't doing a good job, as Trump claims, but because he was doing his job too well -- and that's bad news for the President, because it puts him within range of obstruction of justice charges. Evidence that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice could serve as the basis of impeachment proceedings.

Two significant events may explain this bizarre turn of events. First, grand jury subpoenas were recently served on associates of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, indicating the FBI investigation was aggressively moving forward. As a former federal prosecutor, I have conducted dozens of grand jury investigations and subpoenaing someone to testify is a serious matter. Witnesses testify under oath and knowingly making a material false statement could result in perjury charges. Moreover, witnesses are not subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury unless they are suspected of having knowledge or evidence of a crime. Obviously, this was not good news for the Trump administration, who desperately want to change the narrative and terminate the criminal investigation.

Second, days before his firing, Comey requested a significant increase in money and personnel to expand the scope of the FBI inquiry involving the Russians and Trump's campaign, according to news reports. The Justice Department denied this allegation. A request for additional resources would mean the FBI had identified significant evidentiary leads that needed to be investigated more fully. It seems likely the FBI investigation was proceeding forward with no end in sight.

If the President's real reason for firing Comey was to derail or obstruct the FBI investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and Trump associates to influence the outcome of the presidential election, this could warrant serious legal consequences. More specifically, Trump's actions could constitute obstruction of justice, a federal felony offense.

Most obstruction of justice charges are filed under the omnibus clauses of 18 U.S.C. § 1503 and § 1505 , where the government must prove that: (1) the defendant acted with ""corrupt"" intent (in this case, intent to interfere with or thwart the investigation); (2) the defendant endeavored to interfere with a pending judicial proceeding; (3) there was a sufficient ""nexus"" between the defendant's actions and the pending proceeding (the actions were likely to affect the judicial proceedings); and (4) the defendant acted with knowledge that the judicial proceedings were pending. Further, and most critically in this case, the defendant need not actually obstruct the pending judicial proceeding, but only ""endeavor"" to do so.

If you read the law and compare it to the events unfolding, it seems the actions of Donald Trump and his administration meet some of the required criteria. Trump fired Comey amid a pending grand jury investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and the Russians. Witnesses had been subpoenaed to appear before that grand jury. Further, Trump was likely aware of the pending grand jury proceedings, since he was constantly obsessed with the Russian investigation, and, by firing Comey, attempted to disrupt and interfere with those proceedings. Ultimately, the fundamental issue is whether Trump fired Comey with a ""corrupt"" intent, meaning to obstruct or impede the federal grand jury investigation. If so, President Trump committed a federal crime.

6,"Trump gets 2 scoops of ice cream, everyone else gets 1","According to an extensive interview with TIME Magazine , Trump's White House staff has settled into Trump's routine and know his desires, sometimes before he does,

For example: Trump takes two scoops of ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, TIME reported, while everyone else around the table gets just one.

In the interview published Thursday, Trump also expanded on his view of Russian hacking during the 2016 election, refuted reports that he is unhappy with his current national security adviser and took a level of blame for his combative administration.

But, more than anything, Trump gave TIME a window into some of the oddities that make his White House unlike any in modern history, including the traits that make Trump tick.

Here are some illuminating takeaways from the interview:

Business at any cost

Trump casts himself throughout the interview as America's businessman, someone who is bringing his private-sector savvy to the White House to spur growth and create jobs. That focus extends to faulty digital launching systems on aircraft carriers -- ""Time and material means you're going to get your ass kicked"" -- to arms deals with unlikely African leaders.

TIME reported that Trump brought up how he is trying to mint an arms deal with an African leader who has decades-old human rights concerns, all in the name of spurring American business. Trump declined to name the country.

'It could be my fault'

Trump rarely takes blame, and throughout the 2016 campaign he said he rarely, if ever, apologizes.

But during his interview with TIME, Trump took responsibility -- sort of -- for the combative tone of his administration.

""It could be my fault,"" he said. ""I don't want to necessarily blame, but there's a great meanness out there that I'm surprised at.""

It's not an admission, but it's a close as Trump usually gets.

""I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong,"" Trump told Jimmy Fallon in September 2015. ""I will absolutely apologize sometime in the distant future if I'm ever wrong.""

A level of introspection

Trump, carrying on the tenor of his vicious 2016 campaign, has made Washington a more acrimonious place. Democrats, appalled by his victory, have grown more fearful, more vocal and more disgusted. Trump has kept his foot on the gas, too, with near constant combative tweets.

But doing the TIME interview, as their dinner was wrapping up, Trump appeared to have a moment of introspection.

""It never made sense to me, the level of animosity,"" Trump said. ""All you want to do is, like, let's have a great military. Let's have low taxes. Let's have good health care. Let's have good education.""

Trump, notably, at times during the 2016 campaign demeaned his primary and general election opponents' spouses and attacked a Gold Star family. More recently, he cast the entire media as the ""enemy of the state.""

6,ICE announces major anti-gang operation,"Story highlights Three of the arrests were former DACA recipients

Arrests included mostly US citizens

Washington (CNN) Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced its largest anti-gang operation ever on Thursday, a six-week operation that netted more than 1,300 arrests nationwide.

Though the effort was led by ICE, the focus was not exclusively on immigrants. Of the arrests, 933 were US citizens and 445 were foreign nationals, with 384 in the country illegally.

ICE said three of the arrested individuals were previous recipients of protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, instituted by the Obama administration for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.

Criminal violations or being deemed a public safety threat can void a person's DACA status.

ICE also noted that 10 of the arrests were of people who crossed the border as unaccompanied minors, eight of whom were confirmed to belong to the MS-13 gang , ICE said. Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, is strongest in Central America, especially El Salvador, but extends its criminal enterprise across the US, including cities like Los Angeles, New York and the Washington region.

16,Kushner family won't attend China investor pitch after criticism,"Jared Kushner's sister won't be there this weekend when the family business goes looking for Chinese investors again.

Nicole Kushner Meyer and other executives will not attend investor presentations in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, a spokesman for Kushner Companies told CNNMoney on Thursday. The move was previously reported by The Washington Post.

The real estate business drew criticism after Meyer mentioned her brother and his job as a top White House adviser during a sales pitch last weekend in Beijing. Jared Kushner is married to President Trump's daughter Ivanka.

Kushner Companies was courting investors for a New Jersey development called 1 Journal Square. Ethics watchdogs said Meyer appeared to be leveraging family ties to the White House to enrich the family business. The company later apologized.

Kushner Companies sought to attract real estate investors through a U.S. visa program called EB-5. It promises immigrants a path to a green card if they invest more than $500,000 in a project that creates jobs stateside. The program is frequently used by wealthy Chinese nationals.

Mr Comey was leading an inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election and possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Moscow.

Mr Trump has dismissed the probe as a ""charade"", a claim directly contradicted by Mr Comey's successor.

In his first interview since firing the FBI director, Mr Trump told NBC News on Thursday he had asked Mr Comey whether he was under investigation.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.""

Many liberals had previously called for Mr Comey to be removed, blaming his updates last year about the FBI inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails for Mr Trump's shock election victory.

The White House has depicted the Russia inquiry as ""probably one of the smallest things"" that the FBI has ""got going on their plate"".

But acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said on Thursday that it was ""a highly significant investigation"".

Rosenstein's way out - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - who penned a memo detailing Mr Comey's ""serious mistakes"" - brought a reputation for even-handedness and probity with him to the job of deputy attorney general. Two weeks later, that reputation is being put to the test.

Such is life in the Trump White House, where every appointee and aide is just one tweet, event or press conference away from the maelstrom.

On Tuesday night, as the administration press shop scrambled to explain the president's surprise decision to sack his FBI director, Trump supporters leaned hard on Mr Rosenstein's credentials to paint the move as a nonpartisan decision based on Mr Comey's overall job performance.

The deputy attorney general reportedly balked at the characterisation that he was the driving force behind Mr Comey's dismissal, however.

Mr Rosenstein's threat to resign is different than actually packing bags, of course, and his fate at this point is still tethered firmly to the president he chose to serve.

There is a way out, though. Due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal on the matter, it's Mr Rosenstein's call whether to appoint a special counsel to head the Justice Department's Russia investigation. It may be the one card he can play to sidestep the growing frenzy that spins around him.

A Mexican businesswoman who headed a group of 600 families searching for their disappeared relatives has been killed.

Miriam Rodriguez Martinez was shot in her home in the town of San Fernando in Tamaulipas state.

She was known for successfully investigating the kidnap and murder of her daughter by a local drug cartel, the Zetas.

The information she gave the police ensured the gang members were jailed.

But in March one of them escaped and her colleagues said she started to receive threats.

Her colleagues said she had asked for police protection but was ignored.

The Mexican human rights commission issued a statement saying it deplored her murder and called for a full investigation.

Image copyright Photoshot Image caption The UN in Mexico tweeted its condemnation of the murder

Mrs Rodriguez founded the local collective in her town for families who were victims of violence after her daughter was kidnapped in 2012.

She had managed to find her daughter's body in a clandestine grave and put her murderers in jail.

She also foiled an attempted kidnapping by the Zetas of her husband, when she chased the gang in her car, at the same time notifying the army who then managed to arrest them.

The group she established was part of a wider trend which mushroomed after the October 2014 disappearance of 43 rural student teachers studying at Ayotzinapa in the southwestern state of Guerrero.

Frustrated by a lack of government help, groups of families began their own searches for people who had disappeared in their areas, taking courses in forensic anthropology, archaeology, law, buying caving equipment and becoming experts in identifying graves and bones.

There are now at least 13 of these groups across the country.

A video of an imam appearing to call for the murder of Jews in a sermon during Friday prayers at a Copenhagen mosque has caused outrage in Denmark.

Mundhir Abdallah was reported to police after being filmed citing in Arabic a hadith - a teaching of the Prophet Muhammad - considered anti-Semitic.

The hadith says the Day of Judgement ""will not come unless the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them"".

A Jewish community leader said his words were a ""thinly-veiled"" threat.

Videos of the sermon were posted on YouTube and Facebook by the Al-Faruq Mosque on Sunday, although Mr Abdallah reportedly gave it on 31 March.

A part of the 30-minute address was later translated by the Washington-based Middle East Media Research Institute (Memri).

In the video, Mr Abdallah is seen standing in front of a black flag with the Shahadah written on it, similar to those used by jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda.

He declares there will soon be a ""caliphate"" - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia - that will wage jihad to unite the Muslim community and liberate the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem ""from the filth of the Zionists"".

Then, he says, ""the words of the Prophet Muhammad will be fulfilled"" and cites the hadith.

Immigration and Integration Minister Inger Stojberg also expressed outrage.

The US will consider its interests first as it reviews its climate change policy, the secretary of state says.

Rex Tillerson told a meeting of the eight Arctic nations in Alaska that the US would not rush to make a decision and would consider their views.

President Donald Trump has expressed doubts over the human role in climate change and has said he may pull the US out of the Paris Accord to fight it.

Meanwhile, other Arctic countries have called for a cut on greenhouse gases.

They signed an agreement which stated there was a need for urgent global action.

Climate change was the biggest issue at the biennial meeting of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks, which was overshadowed by the uncertainties over Mr Trump's policy.

Mr Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, told the meeting that the administration was reviewing how it would approach climate change.

Image caption Climate campaigners fear US policy will damage attempts to combat climate change

""We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view, and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns,"" he said.

""We're not going to rush to make a decision. We're going to work to make the right decision for the United States.""

Mr Trump is to decide whether the US will leave or reduce its commitments to the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which was negotiated by around 200 nations and signed in 2015.

An announcement is expected after a trip to Europe later this month.

The joint agreement by the Arctic Council mentioned the Paris accord only in a passing reference, which noted the deal's entry into force and implementation.

But the text did not recommit its members to meet the pledges made.

Reading between the lines: By James Cook, BBC News, Fairbanks, Alaska

Image copyright AFP

Some climate scientists here in Alaska say they are pleasantly surprised by the relatively tough language on climate change adopted by all eight Arctic Council nations including the United States.

The thrust of the text, argues Prof John Walsh, chief scientist at the University of Alaska's International Arctic Research Center, actually echoes the approach of the Obama administration.

The acceptance of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gases (such as methane and carbon dioxide) and pollutants (like black carbon and aerosols) appears significant.

But a couple of things are missing. Although the logic of the statement insists that human activity is causing climate change, the word ""human"" is not actually present. Nor is there a commitment to implement the landmark Paris accord, an omission which is causing alarm among environmentalists.

Not only that, but many of the Trump administration's early policy decisions prioritised economic growth over environmental protection, and Mr Tillerson continues to insist that American climate policy remains under review.

So, in short, it is far too early to conclude that the White House has suddenly been persuaded by mainstream scientific opinion on global warming - and with US politics in astonishing flux, the Fairbanks Declaration may be no more than a holding statement.",bbc-news
10,Microsoft Build 2017: the biggest highlights and all the news,"The second keynote of Build 2017 didn't disappoint when it came to big announcements, and there were even a few surprises that took everyone in attendance and watching by surprise.

Whether another update coming soon for Windows 10, new features, cross-platform collaborations, a Mixed Reality accessory and a whole new design language, Microsoft gave us plenty to digest as it put a bow on Build.

Read on for the biggest highlights of Day 2, and jump to the next page to catch up on everything that happened on Day 1.

Windows 10 Fall Creators Update

Microsoft is releasing another update to its Windows 10 operating system later this year, and it's appropriately called the Fall Creators Update.

Within the update are several new features, some of which we'll dive into in just a little bit. Much of the update centers around a new design language, a unified and responsive experience for users, new applications, and letting users work quickly and seamlessly from any device, whether Windows, iOS and Android.

A big part of the Fall Creators Update is a new design language for developers, called the Fluent Design System. It will allow for responsive, unified apps, experiences and interactions within Windows 10. Developers can create ""more expressive and engaging apps"" with it, Microsoft says, and one of its most important features is that it creates a harmonious experience across devices and platforms.

In other words, no more using an app that looks and responds a certain way on one device only to find it's completely different on another device – a jarring experience, to say the least.

Fluent Design also aims to improve input diversity, letting users interact with their machines using touch, pen, voice, gestures and even eye control.

The simplest way to think of Fluent Design is that it will allow for harmonious and responsive cross-device experiences, which should be a boon for developers and users alike.

Fall Creators Update features and the Microsoft Graph

If you can't tell by a now, a major focus for Microsoft is improving the Windows experience not only across devices, but across platforms.

To that end, it introduced Microsoft Graph. Using the cloud to connect devices and experiences, Microsoft built the Graph API to allow for seamless moving between Windows, iOS and Android. Basically, Microsoft wants the competing platforms to play nicely with each other in addition to improving the experience on Windows machines.

Several new features, coming with the Fall Creators Update, are part of the Microsoft Graph picture. Here are the ones Microsoft highlighted today:

The new Timeline feature will let users retrace their steps to whatever they were doing last, such as recently accessed files, apps and websites they want to pull up again without starting from scratch. A visual timeline lets users see what they've done and select where they want to go. Think of it like macOS' Time Machine, but for hopping back to whatever was last on your desktop.

Along the same lines is the Pick Up Were You Left Off feature (Microsoft may want to shorten the name). With Cortana, users can move activities across Windows, iOS and Android devices, such as starting a doc on a Windows PC and picking it up on an Android phone.

Clipboard elicited a buzz from the Build crowd when announced. It lets users copy text from one device and paste it onto a phone, no matter who that phone is made by. Microsoft gave the example of copying the name of a business you're researching from a PC and pasting it into Google Maps on a Samsung Galaxy S8, to give you an idea.

Last but not least is OneDrive Files on Demand, a feature that lets you access any file you have stored in the cloud without downloading it. This will be great for saving space on your devices as well as collaborative projects. All changes made in the cloud will appear the next time you pull up a file. OneDrive Files on Demand will head to preview versions of Windows 10 in early summer.

Windows Story Remix

Microsoft announced a brand-new app made for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, called Windows Story Remix.

This a creative app lets users edit their photos and videos, adding everything from filters to music to 3D augmented reality objects.

Story Remix can stitch together footage from different sources to create one video, and can intelligently identify people in an image or clip. The aim is to help users create shareable moments, tapping into the creative tools provided by Microsoft and others as well as AI and the Microsoft Graph.

iTunes is coming to the Windows Store

If you need to re-read that, we understand. No one in the Build crowd seemed to anticipate that iTunes is coming to Microsoft's digital marketplace, but as Terry Myerson revealed on stage, it's indeed true.

Apple's iTunes will arrive later this year, giving Windows users access to all it has to offer, including Apple Music.

While PC owners could already download iTunes from Apple directly, this marks the first time the service will be available right in the Windows Store.

This is a huge get for Microsoft's marketplace as it's notorious for having poor app selection. It's also a sign of Microsoft's embrace of competing platforms and services, a big change of course for the company.

Microsoft's Mixed Reality motion controllers

The one bit of new hardware Microsoft unveiled at Build are its own Mixed Reality motion controllers, designed for the suite of Windows Mixed Reality headsets on the way from various partners.

What really sets the controllers apart is that they don't require trackers positioned throughout a room, as you need with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive controllers to create a sense of room scale.

Instead, Microsoft's controllers rely on sensors inside the Mixed Reality headsets to track motion and pick up commands, meaning not only is there no extra installation, but you don't have to pay for any sensors.

What's more, this could make the whole system more portable as you don't need sensors set up anyone's house in order to use them.

The best bit of news is how affordable the controllers appear to be: though we don't know how much they cost on their own, Acer's Mixed Reality headset is getting bundled with the controllers for just $399, going on sale this holiday. That's significantly cheaper than what you'll find from Oculus or HTC.

Developers can pre-order Windows Mixed Reality headsets starting today

Microsoft is certainly moving the mixed reality ball forward, and its hardware partners are right along side.

It was revealed today that the developers in the US and Canada can pre-order Acer and HP's Windows Mixed Reality Headset Developer Edition headsets starting today from the Microsoft Store, and the devices will be delivered later this summer. Acer's headset is priced at $299 while HP's design is $329.

Though a shame you can't buy these headsets yet, it does mean developers get a chance to start working on Mixed Reality applications and other content before the headsets become available to consumers. This is how Oculus Rift released, and it's a smart play by Microsoft.

10,Microsoft brings your hands into mixed reality with surprisingly affordable controllers,"It feels like we’ve known about Microsoft’s Mixed Reality headsets for the longest time, but at Build 2017 we’re finally getting our first look at the VR controllers.

Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers might look similar to those we’ve seen from the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, however, it doesn’t need a tracker. Rather than setting up light boxes IR cameras, sensors in the headset work in tandem with the motion controllers to deliver precise sub-millimeter control and responsive tracking of movement in the user’s field of view.

It’s a far simpler setup we appreciate and given the lower hardware requirements of Microsoft’s Mixed Reality platform, we might actually be able take to a friend’s house and share.

Forget VR, this is the best gaming mouse you can buy

Unfortunately, Microsoft decided not to demo the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers on stage, so we won't get a good look at how well they work until we get some hands on time with them.

What’s even, more impressive about this whole setup is the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers on stage with Acer Mixed Reality Head-Mounted Display will come bundled together for just $399 (about £310, AU$540) – and the bundle is available for pre-order right now and will arrive this holiday.

Microsoft also announced developer versions of the Acer and HP Mixed reality headsets on their own are also up for pre-order on the Microsoft Store for $299 (about £230, AU$400) and $329 (about £250, AU$440), respectively to release this summer.",techradar

10,Microsoft unveils the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update,"Microsoft has announced that its next big update to Windows 10 will be the Fall Creators Update and it’s coming later this year.

You might be thinking, ‘wait a minute, didn’t the Creators Update just roll out?’ And you’d be right, but Microsoft says their not done making its operating system even better for creative types.

Windows Story Remix

At the center of this upcoming Windows 10 build is a new creative app called Windows Story Remix. Its most interesting aspect is that it allows users to create mixed reality content. Microsoft demoed the app by adding 3D objects to photos and video to help tell stories users can explore.

Otherwise, the new app is essentially about helping users create shareable memories out of their photos and videos by automatically stitching them together. From there, users can add little creative touches like a soundtrack, theme, cinematic transitions (read: star wipes), or even draw and write on them with Windows Ink.

The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will hit many of the best 2-in-1 laptops

Windows Story Remix is also a collaborative app, that allows users to share media. For example multiple parents could all shoot different angles of a soccer game and the app will automatically pull together the footage to create a highlight reel.

With face recognition, users could also tell Windows Story remix to make a certain person the start of the video.

While this app is currently untitled, it seems like it will be an interesting new wrinkle to the Windows 10 experience and feels like a perfect fit for Windows 10 Mobile and its lineup of smartphones – which we have no doubt it will land on eventually.

Image 1 of 3 Windows 10 is getting a big makeover Image 2 of 3 Hello white taskbar Image 3 of 3 Apps get a new look too

Fluent Design System

At the heart of the Fall Creators Update is a new user interface called the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which both changes the look and how you interact with apps. Originally code named Project Neon , Fluent Design will drive more expressive and engaging apps for a wide range of devices.

Secondly, the new design language hopes to tackle input diversity head on. With a modern Windows 10 device, users can interact with touch, ink, voice, gaze and gesture. Simply put, Fluent Design hopes to create a more harmonious and responsive cross-device experience.

Pick up and go

Speaking of cross-device experiences, the Fall Creators Update comes with new features specifically designed for those who flip from one device to the next.

Microsoft introduced Timeline to help users jump back into what they were working on. It works by showing users a visual timeline of their desktop so they can get right back into the files, apps and sites they were accessing at the time. At a basic level, it’s a lot like MacOS’ Time Machine, but for revisiting your desktop state from an earlier time and place.

Beyond your PC, Cortana enables the same Pick Up Where You Left Off across a wider variety of Windows, iOS and Android devices. Microsoft gave the example of being able to work on a doc on the PC and Cortana asking a user whether they would like to finish it up on a phone.

Last but not least, Clipboard brings universal copy and paste to Windows devices and beyond. Aside from just clipping text and web links, Clipboard also allows users to transfer photos and animated GIFs from a Windows PC to their preferred mobile device.",techradar
10,Prey review,"In Arkane’s smart and stylish revival of the 2006 first-person shooter, the moon-orbiting Talos 1 space station is being overrun by Typhon, a shape-shifting collective of aliens. It’s up to your character, Morgan Yu, to fight back by any means necessary. However, your goal is just as much about finding a motive worth fighting for.



Is there anyone left to save? Can I actually make a difference? And why am I in the middle of it all? These are all questions that you’ll answer with your actions, or at least try to, throughout the roughly 20 hour campaign.



For some gamers, a gun in-hand is reason enough to truck through to the game’s end. Prey is an action game, after all, so it wastes little time rolling out a pistol, wrench and shotgun, as well as a few other futuristic weapons, like the GLOO gun that freezes enemies in their tracks.



But if you’re looking for more depth in your FPS games, it’s not too difficult to find it here. Prey features a large skill tree filled with fun, upgradeable abilities that will make your trek feel dynamic and fresh, no matter your style of play.



Mixed in with the balance gunplay and supernatural abilities, players can further mix up their strategy by crafting items to build up your offense against the Typhon.



Unlike games like Arkane’s own Dishonored, and BioShock, you aren’t delivered an ending based on your level of violence or lack thereof. The multiple endings hinge on some big decisions you make throughout the story, both in the main quest and in how you handle many of its sidequests.



While Prey is a solid offering on almost all accounts, it misses the mark in a few areas. While performance on the PC was rock-solid, the clumsy melee combat controls never really seem to jive with the hectic movement of the Typhon creatures. And its story, which concludes majestically, takes a little too long to find its groove and misses a beat from time to time.

Talos 1 is so detail-packed that you’ll probably want to squeeze every drip out of it, but the game frustratingly steps on its own toes at times. For example, it’s all too easy to become overwhelmed with quest objectives that have you zipping around the environment faster than you can memorize its layout.



Also, character dialogue will sometimes overlap with audio logs, which essentially makes you miss out on two potentially important bits of story at once and is a little immersion-breaking for the serious atmosphere that Arkane has made.



All said, if you’re a fan of FPS games and enjoy a sci-fi setting, Prey is a must-play. But for the more discerning player, those few minor flaws might stand in your way of total enjoyment.

The tale on Talos 1

Prey is, more or less, an open-world game. As you explore Talos 1 on foot (and outside of it in glorious microgravity), you’ll come across new quests to take on and be treated to many bits of environmental storytelling and collectable lore in the form of notes and audio logs.



If you look and listen closely, you’ll notice the excellent narrative details put into the game, which paints a humanizing (or sometimes, dehumanizing) picture of life on the space station just before, and as, shit hit the fan with the Typhon invasion.

Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6

Prey has many layers to its narrative, but mostly leaves it up to you to peel them all back. It’s a shame that some of its more memorable beats are hidden away, but at least it gives you all the more reason to go back through the journey a second time.



Speaking on the bigger moments in the story that you can’t help but see play out in front of you, many of them unfold exactly as you’d expect. Thankfully, a few big curve balls tossed in along the way really help to avoid being fatigued by familiarity.

Attack and release

A few things are made very clear from the start of the game: you are outnumbered and outmaneuvered by the Typhon.



Ranging from the small, Half-Life headcrab-like Mimics, to the intimidating bipedal Phantoms (and a few others that I won’t spoil for you), the struggle is made just a little more bearable by knowing each enemy’s weakness, discoverable by scanning it with the Psychoscope a la Metroid Prime.



Equipped with this intel, finding the ideal mix and match of assault combos for each enemy type is endlessly satisfying. For most of the beasts, applying some motion-freezing GLOO, followed by some wrench action yields decent results. At best, you’ll lose little health and waste almost no resources in the process.

Speaking of resources, Prey features a robust inventory management system that’s actually a lot of fun to use. The remains of slain Typhon, as well as other scraps and abandoned tech can be salvaged for raw materials for use in crafting items like ammo, medkits and other things that are rare to come by during play, especially in the game’s tough later sections.



That said, there certainly are some encounters that call for the boomstick. And even though you aren’t punished for brute forcing your way through the game, the style of play that yielded the best results involved taking a moment to consider how each battle would affect my resources on hand. There’s nothing that I love more than saying hello to a Phantom with a loud gun, but in most cases (as I fail to illustrate below) I valued having a fat stack of reserve materials a little more.

The power of choice

Neuromods also help you even-out the fight against the Typhon. Shortly after you begin the journey, Morgan can learn new perks with these collectable items that can be used to unlock new abilities and upgrades to your suit’s capabilities.



Want to boost your strength, hack terminals and double your health gauge? Enjoy being stealthy? There’s a perk for that. Additionally, there are chipsets sprinkled throughout the campaign that give your suit some specialized powers, like the ability to see hidden mimics and granting you higher chances of landing critical blows with your favorite weapon, and more.

As such, the skill tree presented here allows for surprisingly deep customization, even allowing Morgan to take on certain traits of the Typhon to gain a considerable edge in combat. Abilities like shape-shifting, teleporting and mind-hacking really broaden the playbook when they become available around halfway through the journey. However, there are some interesting implications at stake for adopting the enemy’s ways.

To hunt and to be hunted

I have a confession to make: it took me a while to not suck at Prey. A common scenario involved being ambushed by a lowly Mimic while it was disguised as a mug. Effortlessly juking around the room, it avoided my every swing of a wrench. Having drained all of my stamina, I realize that I am the prey, owned by the easiest enemy in the game.



While I did become more proficient later on, the wild enemy patterns are tougher to read than they seem. To that end, I appreciate that this game enforces learning through failures and plotting out your attack, even when it’s just a casual encounter with a relatively harmless enemy.



In the end, the harsh, but fair difficulty made applying learned battle tactics to each Typhon encounter during my bleak tenure on Talos 1 one of the more rewarding things I’ve done in a game this year.



Prey is a captivating exploration of how far humans will go to sustain their species, even at the cost of their own lives or others. While it suffers from poor pacing at times and a few quality of life issues, this game more than makes up for it with surprising depth in its story, an incredible atmosphere and an open-ended approach that caters to casual and more hardcore gamers alike.

Arkane has crafted one of my favorite experiences of 2017.

Verdict: Play it now

Prey was reviewed on the PC with code provided by Bethesda.

10,TCL eyes the throne as one of the world's top TV makers,"“It can be overwhelming to walk into a retailer and see all the TVs on the wall. All their settings are cranked up to compete with one another,” Chris Larson, Senior Vice President, TCL tells us at a recent briefing held at Dolby Labs in San Francisco, Calif.

The discussion was about how TCL TVs … well, all TVs really, are calibrated differently for stores than they are for your home. It’s a trick TV manufacturers have been using for years – turning saturation levels up to sickening levels while cranking the brightness up to its maximum level. It’s intense, definitely, and more than a little deceitful.

But let’s not focus on that god-awful practice for a minute. Let’s focus on the wall of TVs.

For anyone who knows the difference between a composite and component cable, this wall is a visual chocolate factory – each television offering a different flavor of eye candy. We love walking into a Best Buy or Tesco to see what’s new in the world of pixels and panels. We comment on how this LG OLED might look better than Samsung’s new QLED screen, at least in terms of contrast, and quibble over whether Android TV is the best or the worst thing to ever happen to televisions in the last century.

But for others, like my parents, this section of the store – and in particular this wall of TVs – is nothing but a bunch of seemingly identical screens. Who makes a better OLED really isn’t on their list of concerns. I’ve tried to explain Quantum Dot, Dolby Vision, HDR and dozens of other technologies over the years to my parents and, honestly, they’re not interested. As long as the TV looks good and doesn’t cost much, they’re happy.

If you want to know how TCL (an acronym that at one point stood for True China Lion) became the third largest TV manufacturer in the world, it’s through people like my parents.

Quality, performance and value

Sorry, that last bit makes it sound like TCL doesn’t make very good TVs. They do. I mean, they’re not exceptional in the same way the LG Signature Series W7 OLED or the Samsung Q9F QLED TV are, but they’re quite good – especially now that they support Dolby Vision.

The reason for my visit to Dolby Labs was to check out TCL’s 2017 line-up. Two series from last year are getting a refresh (the P- and S-Series) while TCL is introducing a completely new line called the C-Series that taps into contemporary aesthetics and adds support for most HDR sources.

These TVs look good and, according to Larson, will also be priced fairly. If you’re looking for a way to help differentiate TCL from the masses of TVs on the aforementioned wall, it’s their brand promise: Delivering uncompromised experiences at a recognized value with an attractive cosmetic.

It’s a promise that seems to be harder and harder to keep every year now that new Chinese TV makers like Hisense and LeEco have moved into the market. To me, this seems like something worth fretting over, but it didn’t seem to scare anyone in that office.

Oprah might give away cars, but Ellen's got TVs covered.

Larsen told me there were already branding programs in place to help make TCL a household name. “We have a partnership with the Ellen Show and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Plus, we acquired the TCL Chinese Theater down in L.A.” Other ties include UCLA athletic teams, the San Jose Earthquakes (a MLS team based in Northern California) and the Rose Bowl, one of the biggest football games in the NCAA.

And while the list is impressive, I’m not sure a few sponsorship deals will be enough to beat out the most ubiquitous names in television like Sony, Samsung and LG – each of whom have a long and storied career in American families’ living rooms. But maybe it will be.

The grand plan

So what’s the end goal here? If TCL got this far in the TV world without an insane amount of brand recognition, why does it want to change anything?

According to Larsen, it's easy to sell smaller value TVs. It’s a crowded market, sure, but in the end value always beats out performance. But being the main screen in the house? That’s much, much harder. To get to the coveted center of the home you’ve not only got to look good in terms of picture quality and cost less than everyone else, but you need a decent design aesthetic, too.

And according to Aaron Dew, Director of Product Development at TCL, that’s where this year’s all new C-Series come in.

The new series will go on sale in late June and combines “contemporary design” (Dew’s words) and the latest in 4K HDR technology. As far as operating systems go, the TVs use Roku OS 7.5 – a close relative of the operating system used on Roku streaming boxes like the Roku Ultra, Roku Premiere+ and Roku Express.

The C-Series will come in 55-, 65- and 75-inch versions and will include both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. (HLG is something TCL is looking into, but not actively including on any TV this year.) They'll feature wide color gamut with advanced LED phosphor for more realistic colors, brighter highlights and increased light-to-dark contrast and support almost 100% of the DCI-P3 color space.

I left the demo impressed with what I saw. The Dolby Vision integration helped add some pizzazz to TCL’s panels, while Roku OS provided a familiar face that I knew could help me find the content I’ve been looking for.

And yet, I couldn’t help but think back to that wall.

When TCL’s latest series make it to showrooms in late June, will my parents be blown away by Dolby Vision? Will they care that the 2017 P-Series now has 72 Contrast Control Zones that increase contrast and clarity? Maybe. Maybe not.

But considering that TCL’s 55-inch C-Series TV, the 55C807, goes for $699 (around £540, AU$950), I guess it doesn’t matter.",techradar
6,OnPolitics Today: Trump contradicted himself on the Comey firing,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump said FBI Director James Comey was fired because of the Clinton email investigation but later contradicted himself. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

Two days. That's how long it took for President Donald Trump to upend his own administration's rationale behind the firing of FBI Director James Comey, the fallout from which continued to engulf Washington on Thursday.

In a letter Trump sent to Comey on Tuesday, the president wrote that he fired the director based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. But in an interview Thursday with NBC's Lester Holt, Trump claimed that Sessions and Rosenstein didn't influence his decision at all. Trump had already made up his mind.

""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" said Trump, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander.""

It's OnPolitics Today, the new daily politics roundup from USA TODAY. Subscribe here.

Some key folks disagree with Trump's characterization of Comey

Trump said this week that he fired Comey because he was ""not doing a good job,"" telling Holt in his Thursday interview that ""the FBI has been in turmoil.""

You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that,"" Trump said. ""You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago, it hasn't recovered from that.""

Except everyone does not know that, including Andrew McCabe, the FBI's new acting director. The White House said this week that Comey had lost the confidence of the bureau, a claim McCabe contradicted on Thursday when speaking to a Senate committee. “The vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,” McCabe said, which continues ""to this day.""

The firing of Comey, McCabe said, would not deter the FBI's investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia: ""Simply put, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing.""

Republican Richard Burr, the North Carolina senator chairing the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Comey "" the most ethical, upstanding individual I’ve had the pleasure to work with.""

And, for what it's worth, a new online poll from NBC News found that a slight majority of Americans — 54% — don't think Comey's sudden firing was appropriate.

So about Rod Rosenstein

The deputy attorney general is getting an invite from senators to brief them about his role in Comey's firing. According to Politico, Rosenstein reached out to Senate Intelligence Committee leaders about meeting amid reports that he was ""furious"" about the White House's characterization of his recommendation that allegedly caused Comey's firing.

Democrat and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer asked Rosenstein more than two dozen questions in a letter on Thursday, including whether Comeys' firing came days after he asked for more resources for the FBI's Russia inquiry, as has been widely reported.

The all-senators briefing with Rosentein is slated for next week, according to a spokesman Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Russia reportedly tricked Trump's White House

Optics be damned, Trump met with top Russian diplomats on Wednesday, the day after firing the man overseeing the FBI's investigation into his own campaign and Russia. In a move both surprising and not, all media was barred from the meeting except one Russia-owned news agency. Photos soon surfaced of a beaming Donald Trump with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the man who's caused much of Trump's Russia-related headaches through his communications with Trump associates, including now-fired adviser Michael Flynn.

CNN reported Thursday that the White House is furious over release of the photos, claiming the Russians ""tricked us.""

16,'Big Bang Theory' season finale: Did Sheldon really do that?,"Sheldon admirer Ramona (Riki Lindhome), third from left, raises anxiety levels for 'The Big Bang Theory' gang in Thursday's Season 10 finale. (Photo: Michael Yarish, Warner Bros. Entertainment)

Spoiler alert: This story contains significant details from Thursday's episode of The Big Bang Theory.

For someone who often seems immune to basic human emotions, Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) showed impressive dramatic flair with his marriage proposal in Thursday’s Season 10 finale of The Big Bang Theory.

The socially awkward genius impulsively flew from California to New Jersey to drop to his knee and offer an engagement ring to girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), who had just started a fellowship at Princeton. In true cliffhanger mode, fans will have to wait until fall to find out Amy’s answer.

Sheldon has had the ring and thoughts of marriage for some time, but it's a romantic kiss from a returning admirer, Dr. Ramona Nowitzki (Riki Lindhome), that compels him to act. He immediately leaves the office, heads to the airport, flies across the country and proposes as Amy opens her apartment door.

“We like to end the season finales on something intriguing, and we found ourselves enjoying the idea that while Amy was away another woman made a play for Sheldon,” says executive producer Steven Molaro. “Those pieces started to fit together.

Sheldon (Jim Parsons), right, pops the question to Amy (Mayim Bialik) at the end of the Season 10 finale of CBS's 'The Big Bang Theory.' (Photo: Michael Yarish, Warner Bros. Entertainment)

“The season finale is a real pivotal moment for Sheldon and Amy,” he says. “When we shot that (proposal) scene, everybody was on stage, (including) the actors who weren’t in the scene. It was emotionally important for us to be part of it. And the studio audience just lost their minds.”

Parsons says he was surprised — but not completely — when he read the scene in the script. Sheldon has been advancing, slowly but surely, over the seasons: dating Amy, entering a committed relationship and losing his virginity with her. This season, they started living together.

Parsons spoke with Bialik about Sheldon’s motivation in proposing.

“The way it was instigated through this woman who came back into his life, there’s something very interesting that he was motivated by that,” he says. “He didn’t need a reminder that he missed (Amy). … Both of us wondered if he wasn’t trying to squash some weird feeling that he was uncomfortable with.”

Molaro, the top-rated sitcom’s head writer, says he’s not fully locked in on how Amy will respond when Bang returns for an eleventh season in the fall.

“On paper, it makes sense that she would say yes, but it’s a little complicated,” he says. “I have versions of the answer that are playing out in my head for us to talk about in the writers room.

Mike D’Antoni is a realist.

So when the Houston Rockets head coach took a step back to evaluate this Western Conference Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs, he wasn’t afraid to speak some truth.

“It could be said that (the Spurs) should win,” D’Antoni told USA TODAY Sports last week before Game 3. “They’re better than us right now. We’re a little bit ahead in our progression.”

Except for one thing: He said that when Kawhi Leonard was actually playing.

The Leonard-less Spurs handed the Rockets a humiliating end to their surprise season on Thursday night at the Toyota Center, closing out the series with a 114-75 win that pits them against the vaunted Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals that will start on Sunday. With Leonard sidelined by a left ankle injury suffered in Game 5, his much-maligned co-star, 31-year-old forward LaMarcus Aldridge, had just the sort of game the Spurs had in mind when they added him in free agency in the summer of 2015.

""He's been like that through these first two rounds,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said after the win. ""He's really turned it on and demanded the ball.""

Latest NBA coverage:

The final inspired line: 34 points on 16 of 26 shooting to go with 12 rebounds. It was Aldridge’s best offensive game since May 2, 2016 when he scored 41 points in a playoff win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. More than that, it was the latest reminder that the Spurs aren’t going away anytime soon.

They lost Tim Duncan to retirement last summer, then saw veteran point guard Tony Parker go down with a season-ending quadriceps tendon tear in Game 2. The lone remaining member of their old-school trio, 39-year-old Manu Ginobili, pulled off a vintage performance in Game 5 that brought them to this point.

One game after his game-saving block on James Harden, with Harden himself having a disastrous finish (10 points on two of 11 shooting, seven assists, three rebounds, and six turnovers), the Spurs turned to their younger crew.

""I don't know what it was,"" Harden said. ""I know they played well, and we didn't.""

San Antonio rookie point guard DeJounte Murray gave them 11 points, 10 rebounds and five assists off the bench (good for a plus-33 mark). Jonathon Simmons, the 27-year-old point guard who played his way to the Spurs through the NBA Development League, added 18 points on eight of 12 shooting.

""It happens,"" D'Antoni said. ""I just told the guys, they had an unbelievable year. ... We'll figure that out and get better this summer and then come back and do it again. It was a pleasure coaching them. They tried to do everything they could to make it a great year. I'm proud to be their coach. I know they feel as bad as I do.""

It would have been one thing for the Rockets to fall in this series with both sides at full strength, a respectable finish after their surprise campaign in which they had the league’s third-best record just one season after sneaking into the playoffs as the Western Conference’s eighth seed. After all, only the Warriors were better than the Spurs (61-21) this season. But this? It was as bad as season-ending exits get.

6,Comey gets the 'United' treatment on 'New Yorker' cover,"The cover for the May 22 edition of 'The New Yorker' depicts former FBI director James Comey being dragged off a flight by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Photo: Barry Blitt, The New Yorker)

The New Yorker, long been known for its comedic covers that flirt with controversy, is taking on the firing of FBI Director James Comey and in the process comparing it to the outrage-inspiring story of the man who was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight.

The cover for the May 22 issue of the magazine shows a complacent Comey being dragged down the aisle of a plane by Attorney General Jeff Sessions who is wearing a police uniform. Looking over his shoulder is the plane's captain, President Trump.

""It’s probably a bit of a leap,"" said artist Barry Blitt about his drawing for the cover, which is titled Ejected. ""James Comey is six feet eight — he probably would have been happy to give up his seat in a cramped cabin.""

An early look at next week's cover, “Ejected,” by Barry Blitt: https://t.co/HJUOYaH8qkpic.twitter.com/kCAqsAOUn5 — The New Yorker (@NewYorker) May 11, 2017

The cover instantly evokes the April 9 incident in which David Dao, a Louisville, Ky., doctor, refused to give up his seat on United flight after being involuntarily bumped. Police yanked Dao from his seat and dragged him off the plane, giving him a concussion and two lost teeth in the process.

Both the United incident and the Comey firing sparked waves of public outrage. It remains to be seen if the outcry over Comey will prove as ephemeral as that which followed Dao's rough removal.

6,Poll: Majority of Americans don't think Comey firing was appropriate,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

A majority of Americans don't believe President Trump's sudden firing of James Comey was appropriate, according to a new poll.

The NBC News and SurveyMonkey online poll found that 54% of Americans believed Comey's dismissal was inappropriate, while 38% thought it was appropriate.

The poll was released the same day that Trump told NBC's Lester Holt that he had planned to fire Comey ""regardless of (the Justice Department's) recommendation.""

The White House had previously asserted that Comey was fired based on the recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who lambasted Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.

However, according to the survey, 46% of Americans believe that Comey was fired because he is overseeing an FBI investigation into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the presidential election.

A 24% faction believe it was because of the Clinton email investigation. Another 22% said the firing was because of something else.

Even though Americans are clearly suspicious of Trump's motives for firing Comey, they don't necessarily like the former FBI director. About 4 out of 10 Americans (44%) said they did not approve of how Comey did his job as FBI director. Only 25% said they approved, and another 28% said they didn't know enough to say.

Comey's recent tenure has been marked by two widely publicized probes – and he didn't get high approval ratings for how he handled either of them. Comey made the unusual decision of coming out in July to announce he was not recommending prosecution against Clinton for her use of a private email server during secretary of State, only to announce he was reopening the probe just 11 days before the November election.

The poll found Comey had a low, 19% approval rating for how he handled the Clinton email probe. Another 57% said they disapproved of his handling of that investigation.

Comey earlier this year announced the FBI was in the middle of a full blown counterintelligence investigation into whether there was any collusion between Russia and Trump campaign associates. Only 34% of Americans said they approved of how he was handling the Russia investigation, while 27% disapproved.

Still, following Comey's ouster, a majority of people (55%) said they were now less confident that the Russia investigation would be fairly conducted. Comparably, 36% said it made them more confident.

A majority of people (54%) said they believed that the alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials is a serious issue. Another 40% said it was more of a distraction.

The poll was conducted online from May 10 to May 11 among a national sample of 3,746 adults.

16,‘Purge’ killer given 3 life sentences,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A killer who said he was inspired by the ""Purge"" movies, was sentenced to three life sentences after a three-day rampage in May 2016 that led to the murder of three Indianapolis men. Dwight Adams/IndyStar

Johnathan Cruz (Photo: Provided by IMPD)

INDIANAPOLIS — Billy Boyd was killed one year ago Friday, as he walked home to care for his father with prostate cancer, his family says. He did not live to see the birth of his first grandchild. His father died shortly after him.

Three days later, Jose Ruiz was shot and killed. His daughter still has nightmares, his niece testified. His 18-year-old son has put off going to college.

""You could always call Billy in the middle of the night,"" his sister, Jennifer Darby, testified Thursday afternoon at the sentencing for her brother's killer, wiping away tears

Family members for 44-year-old Ruiz, 54-year-old Boyd and 40-year-old Jay Higginbotham crowded into the courtroom, sharing their pain and grief in the wake of the senseless rampage committed last year in the name of the horror film The Purge.

Marion Superior Judge Sheila Carlisle sentenced Johnathan S. Cruz, 20, of Indianapolis to three consecutive life sentences without parole for shooting and killing the three men in a three-day span last May. She also sentenced him to 16 years in prison for robbery, which will be served alongside the life sentences.

Cruz previously faced three murder charges and a slew of robbery, intimidation and gun charges. Marion County prosecutors in July notified the court the state would seek the death penalty in the case due to the allegation that Cruz killed three people in the commission of a robbery.

Last month, Cruz pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and one count of robbery. In exchange, prosecutors dropped the other charges and agreed not to pursue the death penalty.

Susan Leon, a niece of Ruiz, said her uncle was a father, husband, friend and godfather to many.

""If you needed anything, you could turn to him,"" she said.

“We see things every week that are difficult to comprehend. We've never seen this.” Terry Curry, Marion County prosecutor

Family members of Higginbotham declined to speak at the hearing, but noted for the court that they approved of the plea agreement.

After the hearing, Darby said many members of her family supported a life sentence from the beginning. She said she does not believe in the death penalty.

Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said his office took into account the defendant's possible mental health problems when considering the plea agreement.

""This individual spending the rest of his life in prison is gratifying,"" Curry said. ""He is 20 years old. His life is effectively over.""

The killing spree, according to court documents, was modeled after the horror film in which the U.S. government designates a 12-hour period where all crimes, including murder, are legal.

To witnesses, Cruz described his violent spree as a ""purge,"" court documents say. Investigators believed it was related to criminal gang activity.

""We see things every week that are difficult to comprehend,"" Curry said. ""We've never seen this.""

16,Nicole Kidman spat out Giada De Laurentiis' pizza on 'Ellen',"Nicole Kidman, food critic (Photo: SRDJAN SUKI, EPA)

Nicole Kidman is one tough food critic, not afraid to tell you when your pizza just isn't cutting it. She'll even spit it out, on live television.

Both Kidman and Ellen DeGeneres had a tough time chewing through celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis' clementine and fennel focaccia bread pizza during a cooking demonstration on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday.

As Ellen soldiered on during the tasting, chomping on the hard bread, Kidman vocalized her thoughts, before literally taking the pizza out of her mouth.

""It's a little tough. I know you're not meant to criticize. But it's a little tough,"" said Kidman, ""Don't let my kids see I did that.""

The sight almost caused DeGeneres to choke on her food.

A laughing De Laurentiis pointed out, ""It's been sitting there for like five hours.""

The Ellen cooking demonstration is classic television. De Laurentiis, promoting her 13th season of Food Network Star, started off the segment teaching the duo how to make arancini balls out of leftover risotto. That brings about a flurry of ""ball"" double-entendres.

The trio laughed it up all the while as an Ellen producer kept urging them to move along.

""Isn't it meant to be relaxing?"" Kidman said at one point.

Colin Kaepernick is still a quarterback without a job, but there apparently are still teams in the NFL that are curious about his prospects.

Harry Edwards, the renowned sociologist who has been an adviser to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, told USA TODAY Sports that three teams have contacted him about Kaepernick since the free agency period opened in March.

This, amid speculation that Kaepernick, 29, is being blackballed after igniting a movement last season when he protested police brutality and racial inequalities by refusing to stand for the national anthem.

“They’ve asked, ‘Can he play? Does he want to play?’ “ Edwards said. “The last question I can’t answer. The first question, absolutely. If Kaep makes up his mind, he wouldn’t only go in and make a team, he’d put pressure on somebody to start.”

MORE COVERAGE:

It is certainly baffling, from a football sense, that a man with a Super Bowl start on his resume hasn’t been offered as much as a backup slot in a league with a dearth of quarterback talent. Even Blaine Gabbert, who was benched last season when Kaepernick returned to the starting lineup, has a new job. Gabbert signed with the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday.

Kaepernick, meanwhile, hasn’t been publicly linked to any team. Although Kaepernick has been seen publicly while engaged in some charity causes during the offseason, he hasn’t commented on his football prospects. Edwards, also a consultant to the 49ers, wouldn’t reveal which teams contacted him and said that he hasn’t spoken to Kaepernick since he opted out of his San Francisco contract.

Is Kaepernick’s lack of opportunity essentially backlash for his protests?

“I don’t think there’s any question that there are some owners who wouldn’t have him in the league, much less on their team,” Edwards said. “But I fully expect one (team to sign him), because it’s in the best interest of the league to have him on a team.

“You can’t have a league that’s approaching 80% black, and then say it you stand up and say anything relevant to these issues – especially in the age of (President) Trump – this is what happens to you. You can’t do that. You can’t just up and right off black protests as if this were 1950.”

In March, ESPN reported that Kaepernick would resume standing for the anthem. Yet that apparently hardly moved the needle on his market appeal.

If he doesn’t wind up with a team, Edwards suggests that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell find a position for Kaepernick at league headquarters.

“I want to hear what he thinks and what he has to say about what’s going on in the league,” Edwards said.

Of course, the best-case scenario is to hear from Kaepernick while he also has the chance to demonstrate that he can still play in the NFL, too.

9,Dana White sets deadline for Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather negotiations | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White is ready to either get the deal done for Conor McGregor to face off with Floyd Mayweather, or he’s walking away from the negotiating table altogether.

White has stated for weeks that he was going to do everything in his power to get the fight done that would see the current UFC lightweight champion likely pocket a paycheck that could potentially exceed $75 million for the matchup with Mayweather.

According to White, his plan was to sit down with McGregor following the birth of his child, which took place last weekend, and now it appears he plans on speaking to the Irish fighter on Sunday to hammer out a deal.

White told Jim Rome on Thursday that he’s hoping to wrap up McGregor’s part of the negotiations on Sunday before then moving on to deal with Mayweather’s camp starting on Monday.

“I plan on having this thing locked up by this Sunday and then moving on to Team Mayweather and starting a negotiation with them. If we really do get it done in that time frame, then this thing could possibly happen,” White said.

“But again, I still need to go negotiate with [Floyd Mayweather’s team]. There’s no guarantee that we’re going to come to a deal.”

Brandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

The flipside is White also stating that if he can’t reach an agreement with McGregor on financial terms on Sunday then he’s calling a stop to the negotiations and moving on from the fight completely.

White said Sunday is “absolutely” his deadline to get a deal done with McGregor but he’s feeling “pretty good” about coming to an agreement with the UFC lightweight champion.

“Hopefully, Monday I’m going to sit down to negotiate with Team Mayweather,” White teased.

McGregor and Mayweather have been flirting with this matchup for more than a year, but it appeared in recent months that the fight was actually going to come together.

The sticking point has always been the financial stakes for McGregor and Mayweather with both fighters claiming to be the larger draw in the matchup, which would mean a bigger piece of the lucrative pay-per-view pie that would undoubtedly earn a ton of money.

White promised McGregor that he would do everything in his power to get the deal done but the sand in the hourglass is nearly running out with the UFC president setting a deadline when he’s walking away from the table.

By all accounts, it appears White will know by Monday if he’s one step closer towards making the fight a reality or putting a nail in the coffin for this long-rumored matchup once and for all.

“Yeah I just can’t keep messing with this thing,” White said. “I need to run my business and I have to focus on all the other things that are going on around here.”",fox-sports

9,How to fix the Houston Rockets in 3 easy steps | FOX Sports,"Year One of the Mike D'Antoni era in Houston went better than anyone expected, but the Rockets' impressive 2016-17 season came to an ignoble end in Game 6 against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday.

Without Kawhi Leonard on the floor to check James Harden, Houston still rolled over and lost by 39 points at home in an elimination game.

While it wasn't the greatest way to go out this season, the Rockets can take solace in the fact they're a team on the rise. They don't need to make any earth-shaking adjustments; they just need to trust their process and make a few changes to turn the modern version of D'Antoni's Suns into a team that can compete for a title.

There was always the chance for a blowout when the San Antonio Spurs decided to sit Kawhi Leonard for Game 6 against the Houston Rockets. We just didn’t expect the Spurs to be the team delivering the thrashing.

Thanks to one of the worst nights of James Harden’s career and a much-needed big game from LaMarcus Aldridge, though, the Spurs eliminated the Rockets from the 2017 NBA playoffs with a 114-75 beatdown.

Aldridge finished with 34 points on 16-for-26 shooting and 12 rebounds, while Jonathon Simmons added 18 points and four assists for San Antonio. Harden went 2-for-11 from the field, scoring 11 points and dishing seven assists in an embarrassing loss that had many questioning his MVP credentials.

The defeat is particularly irksome for Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni, who is now 5-20 in the postseason against Popovich, having lost all five series between the two.

Leonard missed Game 6 due to an ankle injury he suffered in the second half of San Antonio’s overtime Game 5 victory, as the Spurs had the luxury of a potential Game 7 at home on Sunday if they lost on Thursday night.

Instead, San Antonio will tip off the Western Conference finals against the Golden State Warriors, who swept their second-round series against the Utah Jazz, on Sunday in Oakland.",fox-sports
9,Yair Rodriguez explains why he can be a bigger star than Canelo Alvarez in Mexico | FOX Sports,"As the UFC continues to expand into Latin America, featherweight contender Yair Rodriguez would like to become the new face of the promotion in Mexico with hopes to even surpass Saul “Canelo” Alvarez as the biggest combat sports star in his home country.

Now that might sound like very lofty aspirations considering Alvarez has become one of the biggest sports stars in all of Mexico while also becoming a real draw for the sport of boxing.

Alvarez’s most recent fight against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. reportedly sold around one million pay-per-views, which is a massive landmark for the 26-year old Mexican boxer.

Now Rodriguez makes it clear that he has no ill will towards his fellow countryman whatsoever, but he still believes in the long term that he could become an even bigger draw for the Mexican faithful than what “Canelo” is currently pulling for his fights.

“He became a big star. Well why him being Mexican and being a fighter, can I not become a big star in Mexico? Why not? It doesn’t make any sense for me when people ask me,” Rodriguez explained when speaking to FOX Sports. “Why not?

“If I become a champion, if I become the first Mexican UFC champion, I can become bigger because I will be the first one. There are already a lot of Mexican boxers, great boxers. I’m not saying Canelo is not great. He’s great. But I think I can become bigger than that because I’ll be the first one.”

Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports

Lofty goals indeed for Rodriguez but there’s no lack of confidence in the surging featherweight star ahead of his next fight at UFC 211 this weekend.

To remain on his path to become the first ever Mexican born UFC champion, Rodriguez will have to get past Frankie Edgar on Saturday night and that’s no easy task.

Edgar has sat atop two divisions during different stages in his UFC career while currently being ranked No. 2 at featherweight sitting behind only champion Jose Aldo and interim champion Max Holloway. In fact, Edgar has only been defeated by Aldo since moving down to 145 pounds while racking up wins over every other fighter he’s faced including stoppages over Cub Swanson and Chad Mendes.

Despite that resume, Rodriguez not only believes that he can beat Edgar at UFC 211, but he wants to add another career first to his record as well.

He wants to be the first person to hand Edgar a loss by knockout.

“I think he’s never fought a guy like me,” Rodriguez said about Edgar. “Everybody thinks I’m fast, but they don’t know how fast I am until they fight me. Whenever they fight me, they can never find me. I think Frankie Edgar has the potential for me to knock him out because the way that he moves and he’s short. I like to fight short guys because my range helps me out a lot. So I think it’s just because of that.”

As much as the hype around this fight centers around Rodriguez taking a big step up in competition to face a former champion like Edgar, he refuses to acknowledge that this matchup is any tougher than the others he’s faced in the past.

It’s not that Rodriguez doesn’t see Edgar as a threat, but instead he prefers to focus on what he’s doing to get ready for the fight rather than putting any opponent on a pedestal.

“For me it’s just one more fight. With all respect to him, he’s just one more fight for me,” Rodriguez said. “I treated B.J. Penn the same, I treated Alex Caceres the same, I treat any fighter the same. It doesn’t matter. Because for me, they’re just a number. It doesn’t matter if you’re the champion or not. For me, that doesn’t matter. I’m going to treat you the same because you are a human being.

“You have a brain, you have a heart, you have two arms and two legs. You train just like me. It doesn’t matter where you think you are. I’m going to treat you the same.”",fox-sports
9,Joanna Jedrzejczyk wants to be a two-division champion just like Conor McGregor | FOX Sports,"The addition of the women’s flyweight division later this year has Joanna Jedrzejczyk contemplating a chance to make history sooner rather than later.

The reigning and defending women’s strawweight champion has flirted with the idea of moving up to 125 pounds previously but now that the UFC is set to crown the first ever champion in the division later this year, it’s now becoming a reality.

While Jedrzejczyk is laser focused on her title fight this weekend against Jessica Andrade at UFC 211, she can’t ignore the possibility of winning a second world title while joining Conor McGregor as the only simultaneous two division champions in UFC history.

“Maybe next year, I will fight for the second belt. Why not? It’s a big challenge, probably the challenge of my life. We will see,” Jedrzejczyk said on Thursday in Dallas.

Of course, Jedrzejczyk expects to get the same blowback that McGregor received when he began serious pursuit of a second world title while already reigning as champion in a different division.

As McGregor went through two fights with Nate Diaz before finally facing Eddie Alvarez last November for the lightweight title, the featherweight division where he was also champion sat somewhat stagnant as contenders were all hoping for a shot at him.

Jedrzejczyk understands that argument, but she also wants to live out her dreams and goals and nothing would taste sweeter than becoming the first woman in UFC history to hold two titles at the same time.

“I remember when I was talking about this division a year ago people were like ‘focus on your belt’. I’m going for my fifth title defense. That’s the thing, why not? I have bigger, bigger goals and dreams. If I don’t win this second belt, nothing is going to happen because like I said, I already reached my goals and dreams, but there is something better coming,” Jedrzejczyk said.

“People were saying the same to Conor [McGregor] when he was saying he wants to be a king in two different divisions. Same with me. I just want to challenge myself and this is what I’m doing in my life.”

Of course, McGregor promised that he would eventually defend both titles but he never got the chance when the UFC stripped him of the featherweight belt less than a month after becoming a two division champion.

While she can’t predict the future, Jedrzejczyk believes she could stay busy and active enough to defend both titles if she’s fortunate enough to win a championship at 125 pounds.

“If I became a champion [at] 125, I will be jump between 115 and 125,” Jedrzejczyk said. “I want to be the real champion of two different divisions.”",fox-sports

3,Zika virus: Brazil says emergency is over,"Image copyright EPA Image caption The virus has been linked to microcephaly, or abnormally small heads

Brazil has declared an end to a national emergency over the Zika virus after a sharp decrease in cases.

The number of cases dropped 95% between January and April, compared to the same period a year ago, officials said.

The virus has been linked to the birth of babies with abnormally small heads. The threat was at its peak as Brazil prepared to host the 2016 Olympics.

The World Health Organisation lifted its own international emergency in November last year.

The Zika virus has been linked to severe birth defects in almost 30 countries.

Brazil had declared a national emergency in November 2015. The threat led to a campaign to eradicate the mosquitoes which carry the virus.

There were 7,911 cases of Zika from January to April this year, compared to 170,535 cases reported in the same time last year, the health ministry said in a statement (in Portuguese).

No deaths related to the virus have been reported this year, it added, saying that eight people died last year.

Some people might be a little bummed to be called a ""no-talent guy"" by the President of the United States.

But not when it's talk-show host Stephen Colbert dealing with an attack by President Trump.

Colbert was positively giddy on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Thursday night after Trump gave the insult — and more — during a Time magazine interview.

""The President of the United States has personally come after me and my show. And there's only one thing to say,"" said Colbert, happily clapping his hands together during the show's opening. ""Yayyyyyyy!""

The crowd started yelling ""Stephen, Stephen"" as Colbert mouthed ""I love you"" to Trump through the TV camera.

""Mr. Trump. There's a lot you don't understand,"" Colbert added. ""But I never thought one of those things would be show business. Don't you know, I've been trying for a year to get you to say my name. And you were very restrained, admirably restrained. But now you did it.""

Then Colbert could only whisper as he pointed to himself: ""I won!""

Colbert further capitalized on the public relations bonanza by tweeting about Trump before the show:

Trump talked smack about me in TIME mag. If only I had a nightly show to respond on...oh yeah, I do! Join us, won't you? 11:35 #briarpatch — Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) May 12, 2017

""Trump talked smack about me in TIME mag. If only I had a nightly show to respond on...oh yeah, I do! Join us, won't you?"" Colbert wrote on Twitter.

Colbert has leveled a series of blistering attacks on Trump during his show, including one so fierce and off-color it lead to the hashtag #FireColbert. The talk-show host has also picked up a substantial ratings increase with his nightly skewering of the Trump presidency.

Trump finally slammed him back in the Time interview:

""You see a no-talent guy like Colbert. There’s nothing funny about what he says. And what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. And it only builds up my base. It only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better. But his show was dying. I’ve done his show. … But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated. It was high—highest rating. The highest rating he’s ever had.""

16,'Big Bang Theory' season finale: Did Sheldon really  pop the question?,"Sheldon (Jim Parsons), right, pops the question to Amy (Mayim Bialik) at the end of the Season 10 finale of CBS's 'The Big Bang Theory.' (Photo: Michael Yarish, Warner Bros. Entertainment)

For someone who often seems immune to basic human emotions, Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) showed impressive dramatic flair with his marriage proposal in Thursday’s Season 10 finale of The Big Bang Theory.

The socially awkward genius impulsively flew from California to New Jersey to drop to his knee and offer an engagement ring to girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), who had just started a fellowship at Princeton. In true cliffhanger mode, fans will have to wait until fall to find out Amy’s answer.

Sheldon has had the ring and thoughts of marriage for some time, but it's a romantic kiss from a returning admirer, Dr. Ramona Nowitzki (Riki Lindhome), that compels him to act. He immediately leaves the office, heads to the airport, flies across the country and proposes as Amy opens her apartment door.

“We like to end the season finales on something intriguing, and we found ourselves enjoying the idea that while Amy was away another woman made a play for Sheldon,” says executive producer Steven Molaro. “Those pieces started to fit together.

“The season finale is a real pivotal moment for Sheldon and Amy,” he says. “When we shot that (proposal) scene, everybody was on stage, (including) the actors who weren’t in the scene. It was emotionally important for us to be part of it. And the studio audience just lost their minds.”

Parsons says he was surprised — but not completely — when he read the scene in the script. Sheldon has been advancing, slowly but surely, over the seasons: dating Amy, entering a committed relationship and losing his virginity with her. This season, they started living together.

Parsons spoke with Bialik about Sheldon’s motivation in proposing.

“The way it was instigated through this woman who came back into his life, there’s something very interesting that he was motivated by that,” he says. “He didn’t need a reminder that he missed (Amy). … Both of us wondered if he wasn’t trying to squash some weird feeling that he was uncomfortable with.”

Molaro, the top-rated sitcom’s head writer, says he’s not fully locked in on how Amy will respond when Bang returns for an eleventh season in the fall.

“On paper, it makes sense that she would say yes, but it’s a little complicated,” he says. “I have versions of the answer that are playing out in my head for us to talk about in the writers room. I think it’s good for a show when we pull the trigger on these momentous events even when we don’t know if we’re fully ready for it. It keeps it exciting.”

Parsons, like Sheldon, awaits Amy’s answer.

“I will be curious to see where it heads. This could be pretty straightforward,” he muses, before pausing. “Well, that’s not going to be true. Even if they go through with the wedding, there will be something weird about it.”

6,Trump's anger could lead down a dangerous road,"(CNN) Presidents often get angry, but most go to great lengths to hide their fits of rage and the impression that red faced fury rules their actions.

Not Donald Trump.

In three-and-a-half months in office, the 45th President has shown that indignation, impulsiveness and a prickly desire to protect his own self image are at the core of his governing philosophy.

The latest example of the President's simmering fury has emerged in the aftermath of his firing of James Comey this week, apparently the culmination of long-brewing animosity towards the FBI director.

Trump gave a glimpse of his irritation and impatience with Comey during an interview with NBC News on Thursday.

""He's a showboat,"" Trump said. ""He's a grandstander.""

JUST WATCHED Trump: I planned to fire Comey Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: I planned to fire Comey 02:13

Trouble

But such visceral reactions sometimes get the President into trouble. The sudden dismissal of Comey for example could do more than deal a political blow to the President. It could lead him onto perilous constitutional ground and risks embroiling him in a web of investigations that could lead off in unpredictable directions and dig up all sorts of hidden political or legal baggage.

This would not be the first time Trump has hurt himself politically with his temper.

He's spent weeks, for example, waging feuds sparked by his own anger -- opening his presidency with a showdown over the size of his inauguration crowd, then claiming, apparently furious at the never ending Russia election meddling story, that he was wire-tapped by President Barack Obama.

His daily torrent on Twitter, and at less frequent news conferences and campaign rallies, also reveal his highly emotional response to the merest political slight and thin skin for criticism.

But even though his outbursts hurt him sometimes, there's a reason he may be reluctant to cool it. Anger has been a potent political weapon to connect with the animosity toward Washington felt by his supporters. He admitted as much during an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett in January 2016.

""I am angry. I am angry, and a lot of other people are angry too about how incompetently out country is being run. I am extremely angry and upset about it and I think its ridiculous,"" Trump said.

Presidential temperament

Trump is not the first President to feel the bile boiling within. Lyndon Johnson's temper iswaslegendary. Richard Nixon's stomach-clutching fury about his foes is revealed in the White House taping system that led to his downfall. Bill Clinton's staff feared his puce-faced rages. And even Barack Obama vented in private when the cameras were off in rants mostly reserved for his staff, like on the occasion when the Healthcare.gov website crashed on its launch day.

But unlike those Presidents, Trump's emotions and anger form the dominant strain of his political persona. They seem to largely dictate how he conducts his business as president, lashing out at perceived enemies, seemingly without forethought.

The Comey drama suggests serious downsides to such an approach.

It also raises a potentially crucial question that gets to the heart of Trump's hopes for forging a successful presidency. Could his impetuous and extemporaneous use of his executive power become a fatal flaw and lead him into situations far more serious than the political spats he has battled through so far, and even into legal jeopardy?

Any president has the right to replace an FBI director. But it is the timing and the optics surrounding the Comey dismissal that are troublesome for the White House, since the FBI director was overseeing a probe into whether Trump aides cooperated with a Russian effort to meddle in the US election.

Trump was reportedly also mad that Comey refuted his wiretapping claims in a congressional hearing -- though he did some damage control on that issue in his NBC News interview.

""I was surprised he said it but I wasn't angry,"" Trump said.

JUST WATCHED Trump: Russia story made up by Democrats Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Russia story made up by Democrats 02:04

Comey's departure raised suspicions that Trump's decision was motivated not just by deep personal animosity but was an attempt to derail an investigation with the potential to expose deep wrongdoing in his inner circle.

It's what's motivating Trump's anger in this case that will dictate how it turns out.

If Trump did just fire Comey in a fit of pique, he may damage himself politically and foster impressions that his administration is in disarray but he's unlikely to find himself careening down a dangerous legal slope.

But if Trump's anger is motivated by some inside knowledge of alleged links between Russia and his campaign team, or the worry that some other wrongdoing could be exposed, that would be another matter.

""If it turns out for example that the presidency had nothing to do with any of that, if it turns out that it was entirely irrelevant and he is firing Comey for political reasons it pretty much dies on the vine,"" said Andrew Hall, a lawyer who represented John Ehrlichman, assistant to the President for domestic affairs during the Nixon administration who was caught up in Watergate.

""But if it goes further than that to show that he is trying to protect either himself, or some other member of his team from the disclosure of an event that would be criminal or an huge embarrassment and he goes through illegal acts that would prevent the disclosure, then he is going to get himself into trouble,"" Hall said.

Motive unclear

So far it's been almost impossible to judge whether Trump's is simply acting rashly or with more nefarious forethought since his own administration's explanations have been laced with confusion and contradictions.

He told Comey for example in his letter or dismissal that he was accepting a recommendation he received on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to let him go because of his handling into the Clinton email investigation.

The next day, the White House said that Trump had actually been thinking of canning Comey ever since he was elected in November.

CNN's Jeff Zeleny and John King reported that the President was ""white hot"" over Comey , and complained about the FBI chief's comment that he felt ""mildly nauseous"" that his comments about Clinton may have swayed the election.

Trump also thought that the FBI boss did not take leak investigations seriously enough and thought he was his ""own man"" who could spell trouble being so close to the presidency, CNN reported.

Then on Thursday, Trump came up with his own motive for canning Comey complaining about his ""showboat"" persona.

The various accounts certainly fog the issue politically and make it difficult to understand exactly what the President's intentions were.

But they may also inadvertently be providing Trump with a legal shield.

""The more plausible, benign reasons and motivations you may have to do a firing of an otherwise at-will employee actually can undermine a prosecutor's case in a criminal obstruction charge,"" CNN legal analyst Laura Coates said on ""Newsroom"" Thursday.

""If there were these non partisan, nonpolitical reasons and motivations, even if they are contradictory, and even if they cannot toe the line of a consistent story, they undermine it criminally,"" Coates said.

Still, Trump may also want to consider that even if his motives are not sinister, the White House's behavior in the Comey affair invites suspicion and investigation.

That's where administrations can get drawn into tampering or thwarting inquiries and trying to prevent truths coming out and eventually get stuck in the legal mud. After all it was not the burglary at the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate that caused Nixon's downfall, but the efforts he and his team took to cover it up.

In that sense, there may be a smart political case for Trump to keep his anger in check and to lay low for a while -- even though such a move would contradict almost every one of his personal and political reflexes.

""A sophisticated political player would know that the smartest thing to do when the storm is brewing is batten down the hatches so to speak ... let the storm pass under its own terms and you don't basically expose yourself in the storm to what ever uncertainties there are,"" said Hall, of Lamb, Hall & Leto.

""There is a whole lot of downside risk. That's the lessons of 1973 and 1974 and 1975 -- these things evolve a life of their own and your conduct really is like anger and revenge -- served hot they are very dangerous, served cold they are different,"" he said.",cnn
13,Another scorpion reported on United flight,"A United Airlines Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner takes off from Los Angeles International Airport in March 2017. (Photo: Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, special for USA TODAY)

HOUSTON — A United Airlines flight from Houston to Ecuador was delayed Thursday evening at George Bush Intercontinental Airport after a scorpion was spotted on board the plane.

It's the second time in less than a month that one of the stinging insects has been reported on a United aircraft.

According to United, a scorpion reportedly crawled out of a passenger’s clothing Thursday on Flight 1035 as the flight was preparing to take off from Bush and travel to Quito, Ecuador. Paramedics examined the passenger and determined that he had not been stung.

It is unclear whether a scorpion was ever found.

Flight 1035 eventually took off, 3½ hours late, to Ecuador.

United issued the following statement Thursday evening:

""Houston to Quito Flight 1035 returned to the gate after a scorpion reportedly emerged from a customer’s clothing. Paramedics at the gate immediately examined the customer and determined that he had not been stung.

“The customer declined further medical treatment and, as a precaution, a new aircraft was arranged. We provided all passengers with a meal voucher due to the delay and the flight, with the customer aboard, has departed for Quito.""

On April 14, another man was stung by a scorpion on a United flight from Houston to Calgary.

United has been under increased scrutiny after a passenger was dragged by aviation police off a United Express flight April 9, leaving him with a concussion and two broken teeth. The airline needed to remove four passengers after Flight 3411 from Chicago O’Hare to Louisville had loaded to make room for crew members.

And it's unclear how much Clapper would know about developments in the investigation after he left office earlier this year.

JUST WATCHED Tapper: The real reasons Trump fired Comey Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tapper: The real reasons Trump fired Comey 03:23

Trump's reasoning behind firing Comey

The official White House version of how Comey came to be fired was that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

But mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russia probe.

Sources have told CNN that Trump's decision to ax Comey was made after he grew increasingly frustrated with him following a congressional hearing last week in which he said he was ""mildly nauseous"" over the idea that he helped sway the 2016 election. A source close to Comey told CNN's Jake Tapper Wednesday there are two specific reasons why Trump fired the FBI director:

1. Comey never provided the President with any assurance of personal loyalty.

2. The FBI's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia in the 2016 election was accelerating.

Trump's surrogates, including Vice President Mike Pence, have struggled to keep up with the shifting narrative on how and why the decision was made, and Trump tweeted Friday it was ""not possible"" for his team to recount details and talking points with ""perfect accuracy.""

On Thursday, Trump, discussing the firing of Comey, told NBC News that he was frustrated by the ongoing investigation and believed it was motivated by Democrats' fury at losing the election.

Trump told NBC's Lester Holt: ""And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.'""

Comey has not yet responded to the Senate intelligence committee's invitation to testify in closed session next week, Democratic and Republican spokespersons for the committee told CNN Friday.

Trump threatens press

Comey was not Trump's only target of an apparent threat Friday -- he also suggested the possibility of ending White House press briefings

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

6,Trump just threw his entire WH staff under the bus,"In an interview with NBC's Lester Holt Thursday night , the President directly contradicted the reasoning his staff -- as well as Vice President Mike Pence -- had laid out for his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.

""I was going to fire Comey -- my decision,"" Trump told Holt. ""There is no good time to do it, by the way. I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.""

That assertion came fewer than 18 hours after Pence was on Capitol Hill telling a totally different story. ""The President took strong and decisive leadership here to put the safety and the security of the American people first by accepting the recommendation of the deputy attorney general to remove Director Comey as the head of the FBI,"" Pence said Wednesday.

And he was far from the only one singing from that songbook -- which Trump promptly ripped up in his interview with Holt.

""The President was presented with a pretty clear and direct and very strong recommendation by deputy Attorney General (Rod Rosenstein),"" said White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ""The deputy made the recommendation, the president made a swift and decisive action and let Comey go.""

Then there was this from White House counselor Kellyanne Conway: ""He acted decisively today, he took the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General.... I would really ask everyone tonight to read Mr. Rosenstein's memo. This is what he presented to the Attorney General, he presented to the President and the President took decisive action.""

There is no amount of spin available in the world that would somehow make what Trump said Thursday night jibe with what his aides and his vice president said earlier in the week. It's simply not possible. C-a-t doesn't spell dog.

Trump seemed to acknowledge Friday morning the impossibility of his surrogates keeping up with him: ""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" he tweeted.

As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Why would Trump say what he said to Holt -- knowing that it would undermine the significant work his White House had done over the past 24 hours to cast the Comey firing as more than just a fit of pique by the President?

Simple. Trump imagines himself as the decider, the guy sitting in the boardroom and telling people ""you're fired!"" (Never underestimate how much of his personality as president is shaped by his time as a reality show boss on ""The Apprentice."") While the story of Rosenstein detailing the FBI's issues with Comey in a memo to Trump and then Trump thoughtfully considering it before making a decision is clearly the best face to put on the situation, it doesn't make the President central enough to the firing.

Trump wants the credit. He wants everyone to know he had already made the decision to get rid of Comey before the Rosenstein memo. Because he's the boss. He's the guy who makes the calls. He doesn't sit around and wait for memos from underlings.

Seen in this light, the Rosenstein memo was nothing more than a paper-trail creation to justify Trump's action. Trump was going to get rid of Comey because he didn't like Comey -- thought he was a showboat and insufficiently loyal. Period. Everything else, as Trump himself made clear in the interview with Holt, is just window-dressing.

Trump has always been a solo operator. He likes it that way. He wants the credit any time he feels credit is due. Being a member of his staff is accepting that reality and eating the embarrassment that comes with your boss directly and publicly contradicting you in the space of 18 hours.

The question for me is how long are people like Pence willing to just sit back and take it?",cnn

6,Comey turmoil puts Trump's isolation on view,"Washington (CNN) Days after his abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump's attempts to triage the fallout only plunged the episode further into confusion.

Conflicting accounts of how and why the firing happened ricocheted across Washington Thursday, each seeming to push the decision closer to Comey's oversight of an investigation into Russian election meddling.

Trump himself linked the decision to the Russia probe in an interview. His spokeswoman suggested Comey's dismissal could hasten the inquiry.

The turmoil surrounding Comey's dismissal has frustrated the President and his senior-most aides, according to people familiar with the situation. All have expressed anger that the decision to fire Comey wasn't properly executed and created a sharp backlash. The topic has all but consumed the West Wing, where Trump remains holed up Friday, his seventh straight day without a public event.

Attempts to move on from the firing have been minimal. Trump's own official schedule remains empty, leaving some of his allies wondering whether his governing agenda has veered drastically off course. Even the normal parade of photo-ops has been scrapped; instead, Trump signed two executive orders behind closed doors Thursday, avoiding any more questions about his decision to remove Comey from his post.

It all led to the impression of a commander in chief operating in chaotic isolation while leaving even his closest allies to pick up the pieces. Trump seemed to confirm the situation himself on Twitter Friday morning.

'I was going to fire Comey'

There are few signs that the crisis is close to lifting.

On Friday morning, Trump fired off a thinly veiled threat to Comey: ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press.""

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

The tweet marks an extraordinary development in the ongoing feud between Trump and the agencies investigating alleged ties between his campaign and Russia.

Trump also threw two days of official White House accounts into dispute by insisting he'd long planned to fire Comey, even before his Justice Department provided him a reason, and suggesting he was thinking about the FBI's Russia investigation when he made the decision.

""When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,' "" Trump told NBC News.

""Regardless of the recommendation,"" Trump told NBC, ""I was going to fire Comey.""

That flew in the face of what his top deputies -- including Vice President Mike Pence -- had said publicly about the incident in the 24 hours after the dismissal. Pence said seven times on Capitol Hill Wednesday that Trump acted only after receiving the recommendation to fire Comey from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Trump's spokeswoman, explaining her own statements that seemed to be contradicted by the President's interview, said Trump hadn't told her that he was long planning to dismiss his FBI director.

""I hadn't had a chance to have the conversation directly,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday. ""I went off of the information I had when I answered your question. I've since had the conversation with him, right before I walked on today. And he laid it out very clearly. He had already made that decision. He had been thinking about it for months.""

Meanwhile, the FBI's acting director told a congressional panel that Comey enjoyed ""broad support"" at the FBI, further undercutting Trump's explanation that Comey had been dismissed because he'd lost the support of his staff.

Toxic atmosphere

In his interview, Trump said Comey had fostered a toxic atmosphere at the FBI, which his dismissal was meant to remedy. But on Capitol Hill, the agency's acting director denied that rank-and-file agents at the bureau were dissatisfied with their leadership. Instead, he said Comey commanded widespread respect among his employees, including himself.

""I hold Director Comey in the absolute highest regard,"" said the acting director, Andrew McCabe. ""I have the highest respect for his considerable abilities and his integrity.""

He said Comey enjoyed ""broad support within the FBI and still does to this day"" and added ""the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep, positive connection to Director Comey.""

People within the bureau said the firing had caused anger among agents toward Trump. A planned visit by Trump to FBI headquarters this week never materialized.

""He wouldn't have been received well,"" one official said of the President, noting the bureau remains shellshocked over Comey's firing.

At the White House, tensions were high. Many top officials placed blame on the press office for its handling of the situation, though few in the communications wing had advance warning that Trump was planning to fire Comey.

One official called the attempts to handle the aftermath an ""embarrassment. Another termed the cleanup attempts ""a disaster.""

The President himself thought it was ""handled poorly,"" according to one person familiar with Trump's thinking.

The scramble to contain the fallout of Trump's decision reflects a sudden change for a president who, less than a week ago, was celebrating a major victory: passage of a Republican health care plan in the House of Representatives. The moment has proven distracting for a President facing a series of hard decisions about US policy, as well as a grueling five-stop foreign swing that begins in just over a week.

Grudges

Trump himself signaled his continued preoccupation with the matter Thursday afternoon, sending a message on Twitter citing his longtime nemesis, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who called for Comey's dismissal in December.

""We finally agree on something Rosie,"" the President wrote. Moments later, he continued his Twitter tirade: ""Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.""

Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2017

The messages reflected Trump's longstanding preoccupation with the claims his campaign coordinated with Russia during last year's election. Trump has viewed the claims -- along with the FBI investigation into them -- as a challenge to the legitimacy of his presidency, according to people who have spoken with him.

Trump has been nearly perpetually frustrated by Russia probe, which he believes has overshadowed parts of his agenda, according to people familiar with his thinking.

Trump also bore a grudge against Comey for shooting down his claims during public congressional testimony that Trump's phones had been tapped by President Barack Obama's administration, according to sources.

But firing Comey did not end the conversation about the FBI's look into Russian meddling; if anything, the story has emerged with renewed force.

Investigation remains

Trump admitted in his interview with NBC that he'd asked Comey directly whether he was under investigation during a dinner sometime this year, claiming Comey had assured him that he wasn't. Trump said that Comey had requested the dinner ""because he wanted to stay on,"" even though FBI directors serve 10-year terms that span presidential administrations.

Speaking Thursday, McCabe called the Russia inquiry ""highly significant"" and said Comey's firing would not impede the agency's work.

""You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,"" McCabe said.

Meanwhile, at the White House, Trump's spokeswoman suggested that Comey's firing could hasten the FBI's work.

""We want this to come to its conclusion, we want it to come to its conclusion with integrity,"" Sanders said, referring to the FBI's probe into Moscow's interference in last year's election. ""And we think that we've actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen.""",cnn

6,AG Sessions paves way for stricter sentencing in criminal cases,"(CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a new directive for federal prosecutors across the country: charge suspects with the most serious offense you can prove.

Friday's announcement follows a line of several other significant departures from Obama-era domestic policies at the Justice Department, but this decision crystalized Sessions' position in the criminal justice realm.

In a brief one-and-a-half-page memo , Sessions outlined his new instructions for charging decisions in federal cases, saying that his new first principle is ""that prosecutors should charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense.""

""The most serious offenses are those that carry the most substantial guidelines sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences,"" Sessions later adds.

While the federal sentencing guidelines are advisory -- and take into account everything from a defendant's criminal history to cooperation with authorities -- some judges have felt handcuffed by mandatory minimums, which provide a statutory sentencing minimum of months below which the judge cannot depart.

The move was harshly criticized by the New York University School of Law Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute focused on democracy and justice.

""The Trump administration is returning to archaic and deeply-flawed policies,"" Inimai Chettiar, the center's justice program director, said Friday. ""Sessions is leaving little to no room for prosecutors to use their judgment and determine what criminal charges best fit the crime.""

""That approach is what led to this mess of mass incarceration,"" she added. ""It exploded the prison population, didn't help public safety, and cost taxpayers billions in enforcement and incarceration costs.""

The American Civil Liberties Union said Sessions' move would return the government to failed policies and could prompt long mandatory minimum sentences.

""Jeff Sessions is pushing federal prosecutors to reverse progress and repeat a failed experiment -- the War on Drugs -- that has devastated the lives and rights of millions of Americans, ripping apart families and communities and setting millions, particularly black people and other people of color, on a vicious cycle of incarceration,"" said Udi Ofer, director of the ACLU's Campaign for Smart Justice.

Sessions also formally withdrew a signature part of Attorney General Eric Holder's ""Smart on Crime"" initiative, which sought to target the most serious crimes and reduce the number of defendants charged with non-violent drug offenses that would otherwise trigger mandatory minimum sentences.

""We must ensure that our most severe mandatory minimum penalties are reserved for serious, high-level, or violent drug traffickers,"" Holder wrote in a 2013 memo. ""In some cases, mandatory minimum and recidivist enhancements statutes have resulted in unduly harsh sentences and perceived or actual disparities that do not reflect our Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

As a result, during the Obama era, federal prosecutors were instructed not to charge someone for a drug crime that would trigger a mandatory minimum sentence if certain specific factors were met: (a) the relevant conduct didn't involve death, violence, a threat of violence or possession of a weapon; (b) the defendant wasn't an organizer, leader or manager of others within a criminal organization; (c) there were no ties to large-scale drug trafficking operations; and (d) the defendant didn't have a ""significant"" criminal history (i.e., prior convictions).

All of those charging factors are now gone under Sessions' reign and not surprising, as he has previously telegraphed his desire to prosecute more federal cases generally.

The effects of Friday's decision are likely to be felt most immediately in the narcotics context where federal mandatory minimums established by Congress can be harsh for even first-time offenders because the sentences are dictated based on drug type and quantity.",cnn

3,FBI chief sacking: Trump warns Comey over leaks to media,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Trump has insisted he was told by Mr Comey that he was not under investigation

US President Donald Trump has warned fired FBI chief James Comey against leaking material to the media.

In a tweet on Friday, he said Mr Comey had ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations"".

Mr Comey, who had been leading an inquiry into possible collusion between Trump election campaign officials and Russia, was fired on Tuesday.

Mr Trump has since insisted he was told by Mr Comey that he was not under investigation.

Read more:

Twice over dinner and once over the phone Mr Comey had told him he was not a target of the inquiry, the US president said.

His comments raised accusations among opponents that he was interfering in the investigation.

Mr Trump also said this week that he alone was responsible for the decision to sack Mr Comey, calling him a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"".

But this explanation appeared to undermine earlier comments from administration officials that Mr Comey had been fired on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein.

The first line of Mr Trump's letter sacking Mr Comey refers to a memo written by Mr Rosenstein and says: ""I have accepted their recommendation"".

But he later told NBC he was ""going to fire him regardless of the recommendation"".

Apparently angered by criticism of the different accounts, Mr Trump used another of his tweets on Friday to say: ""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!""

He added: ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

Mr Trump has dismissed the FBI investigation as a ""charade"" and has said Democrats are using ""fake news"" about collusion with the Russians as an excuse for losing the election.

It was unclear whether Mr Trump's reference to ""tapes"" suggested there might be secret recordings of conversations that could be used to challenge any statements by Mr Comey, or whether it was simply a way of warding him off from commenting.

But the reference has done nothing to silence the echoes of the Watergate affair that have resounded around the Russian interference inquiry.

In 1973, President Richard Nixon sacked Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor who was seeking access to tapes of presidential conversations that ultimately led to Mr Nixon's resignation.

In another tweet on Friday, Mr Trump said: ""When [former Director of National Intelligence] James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?""

However, Mr Comey's successor, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, said on Thursday that it remained ""a highly significant investigation"".

In testimony to the Senate intelligence committee, he also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of his staff.

""I can confidently tell you that the vast majority of employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,"" Mr McCabe said.

Separately on Friday, Mr Trump's lawyers said a review of the past 10 years of his tax returns showed ""no income of any type from Russian sources"".

3,Mexican mum who investigated daughter's death is killed,"Image copyright EPA

A Mexican businesswoman who headed a group of 600 families searching for their disappeared relatives has been killed.

Miriam Rodríguez Martínez was shot in her home in the town of San Fernando in Tamaulipas state.

She was known for successfully investigating the kidnap and murder of her daughter by a local drug cartel, the Zetas.

The information she gave the police ensured the gang members were jailed.

But in March one of them escaped and her colleagues said she started to receive threats.

She was killed on Mexico's mother's day, 10 May.

Her colleagues said she had asked for police protection but was ignored.

State prosecutor Irving Barrios told a news conference that security needs had been met and police officers made rounds three times a day. Her family disputes this.

The Mexican human rights commission issued a statement saying it deplored her murder and called for a full investigation.

Image copyright Photoshot Image caption The UN in Mexico tweeted its condemnation of the murder

Mrs Rodríguez founded the local group for families who were victims of violence after her daughter, Karen Alejandra, was kidnapped in 2012.

She had managed to find her daughter's body in a clandestine grave and put her murderers in jail.

She also foiled an attempted kidnapping by the Zetas of her husband, when she chased the gang in her car, at the same time notifying the army who then managed to arrest them.

According to one of her fellow campaigners, Mrs Rodríguez felt she could not sit back after her daughter's killers were caught.

""She told us that she was incomplete, that although she had found her daughter, nothing would ever return to normal for her,"" Graciela Pérez told the BBC.

Ms Pérez, who also has a missing daughter, described the murdered activist as someone ""with a very strong, caring and cheerful character"".

The group she established was part of a wider trend which mushroomed after the October 2014 disappearance of 43 students from Ayotzinapa in the southwestern state of Guerrero.

Frustrated by a lack of government help, groups of families began their own searches for people who had disappeared in their areas, taking courses in forensic anthropology, archaeology, law, buying caving equipment and becoming experts in identifying graves and bones.

There are now at least 13 of these groups across the country.

6,Lib Dems to back a 'regulated cannabis market' in UK,"Image caption The party has long argued drugs laws are a ""failure"" and made fresh calls for a regulated cannabis market

The Liberal Democrats would legalise selling and growing cannabis if elected, the party has confirmed ahead of publishing its manifesto.

The party would allow licensed shops to sell the drug to over-18s, let people grow cannabis at home and introduce small ""cannabis social clubs"".

The Lib Dem spring conference in 2016 backed a regulated cannabis market.

The party's manifesto will also include a promise to extend paid parental leave for fathers from two weeks to a month.

Under UK legislation, anyone found possessing cannabis can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both punishments - but many argue that the law is not enforced.

Supplying or producing cannabis, which is a class ""B"" drug, attracts a maximum 14-year prison sentence, unlimited fine or both, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

'Criminal gangs'

It is legal to consume small amounts of marijuana in some other countries - including Norway, the Netherlands and Portugal - while in other countries police do not arrest people for possession.

In 2001, Portugal became the first country in the world to decriminalise the use of all drugs.

Last year, the Lib Dems backed proposals for a ""regulated market"" to control the pricing, potency and packaging of sales to over-18s.

The proposals were outlined in a report, co-authored by the government's former chief drugs adviser Sir David Nutt, which argued that cannabis should be taxed - and that doing so could yield up to £1bn a year for the government.

Image caption In the Netherlands, cannabis products are sold in ""coffee shops"" and possession of small amounts for personal use is allowed

The Lib Dems' Julian Huppert confirmed the policy would appear in its upcoming manifesto to BuzzFeed, saying: ""The market is run by criminal gangs and they have no interest in public health - the system is causing huge amounts of harm.""

During the 2015 election campaign, the Lib Dems called for drug use to be treated as a health rather than a public policy issue.

Labour in its 2015 manifesto called for better drug treatment services, while the Conservatives said they would introduce random drug-testing in jails.

Speaking last year, the Lib Dems' health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said that ""the war on drugs has been a catastrophic failure"".

""We criminalise thousands of people, blighting their careers,"" he said. ""When people buy cannabis from criminals, they have no idea what they are buying.""

'Health and happiness'

The party is also promising extra paid paternity leave - which it is calling ""Daddy Month"" in a bid to encourage more sharing of parental responsibilities.

Jo Swinson, equalities minister in the coalition government when shared parental leave was introduced in 2015, said: ""More needs to be done to encourage men to take leave when they become a dad.

""Research shows that fathers being more involved in their children's lives is good for children's development and good for the health and happiness of the whole family.""

Labour has also said it supports extending paid paternity leave.",bbc-news

Reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner says she is considering entering US politics in a bid to promote transgender issues.

She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she had been ""really upset"" by some of President Donald Trump's policies on the LGBT community.

The ex-Olympic athlete, who changed her name and transitioned to living as a woman aged 65, said Mr Trump was being ""influenced by people around him"".

Jenner said her life was ""much simpler"" now she was living openly as a woman.

Over the past two years, Jenner has become the most famous transgender person in the world.

'No regret'

A Republican supporter who supported Mr Trump in last year's US election, Jenner said she was disappointed the new president had overturned guidance allowing transgender students to use school toilets matching their gender identity.

""It doesn't make me regret my vote yet, but it is very disappointing and I have been very verbal about that,"" she said.

""I thought Trump would be better on these issues.""

Asked why she believed that, she said it was because she had ""talked to him"", adding: ""I will have more conversation with him about it in the future.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A former athlete, Jenner won gold at the 1976 Olympics

She told the programme she was now considering going into politics to promote LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) issues.

""I do a lot of political stuff, but it is mostly all behind the scenes,"" she said.

Asked if she would stand for election, she added: ""I have been asked that question quite a bit, to be honest with you - over the next year I'm looking into it.

""I want to know where can I do a better job for my community, in bringing the Republican Party around when it comes to all LGBT issues.

""Is it from the outside? Kind of working on the outside and the perimeter and working with everybody to get the Republicans to change their thinking?

""Or is it better off being on the inside and actually running for a Congress or Senate seat? Can I do more good there? And those are the things that I am evaluating.""

10,Smartphones that charge in five minutes 'could arrive next year',"Image copyright StoreDot Image caption StoreDot has produced mock-ups of a smartphone charging in a special dock

Smartphones with batteries that fully charge in five minutes could be available to consumers next year.

The technology was first shown off in 2015, when Israeli start-up StoreDot demonstrated its FlashBattery at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.

Chief executive Doron Myersdorf told the BBC it is now expected to enter production in early 2018.

However, Ben Wood, a technology analyst at CCS Insight, said he had doubts about the claims.

Mr Myersdorf said he could not reveal which manufacturers were signed up to use the technology.

In 2015, he told the BBC his firm's battery contained materials that allowed for ""non-traditional"" reactions and the unusually fast transfer of ions from an anode to a cathode - the electrical process that charges a battery.

The design involves nanomaterials, which feature extremely small structures, and - unnamed - organic compounds.

Some versions of the battery were thicker than most smartphone batteries at the time, but now Mr Myersdorf has claimed it is ready for the market.

""We will charge a smartphone in five minutes,"" he said.

He added that the technology was in pilot production at two Asian battery makers and that ""mass production"" was expected to commence in the first quarter of 2018.

'Remain sceptical'

Mr Wood, while remaining unconvinced whether the rollout would happen as quickly as claimed, did admit that if the battery worked as planned, then it could be a major moment in the industry.

""Taking risks with battery technology can bite you,"" he told the BBC. ""I would say that experience has taught me to always remain sceptical. Let's see if it happens would be my view.""

He pointed out, for example, that any design that generates large amounts of heat can impact the performance of the battery.

However, he added that anyone who did manage to crack the ""battery problem"" could have a transformational effect on consumer electronics.

Other manufacturers are also working on quick-charging battery tech.

In November, Qualcomm announced its Quick Charge 4 system, for example, that offers five hours of battery life following a five-minute charge.

Image copyright StoreDot Image caption StoreDot claims it could also charge a car battery in only five minutes

StoreDot also unveiled an electric car battery that charges in five minutes at a tech show in Berlin this week.

The firm said the battery provides 300 miles of range.

A demonstration of the technology was given at the Cube Tech Fair - though the short presentation ended before the battery had finished charging.

""We don't have contracts but we are working with car companies to develop the battery - this will take another three years or so to be on the road,"" said Mr Myersdorf.

By contrast, Elon Musk's electric vehicle firm Tesla says its Supercharger technology takes 75 minutes to fully charge the battery in one of the firm's cars, such as a Model S for example.

A 30-minute charge would allow for 170 miles of range with the same system.

""Consumers want charge times similar to filling up their cars at a petrol station,"" said Joe Kempton, an analyst at Canalys.

But real applications would depend on ""whether the technology can be produced at a large enough scale"" and at the right cost, he added.",bbc-news

Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60

Europe braced for the possibility of an in-cabin laptop and tablet ban on flights to the United States as officials prepared for talks Friday about expanding a March ban for airlines flying out of some Middle East and African airports that would affect millions of passengers.

Officials from France, Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy will take part in a conference call later Friday with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a transport spokeswoman for the European Commission, the 28-nation political bloc's executive branch, confirmed the talks.

No decision has been made and it was not clear when one would may be handed down. Itkonen said the EU had no new information about a specific security concern that would have prompted the talks or required additional safety measures.

Any expansion of the ban that currently impacts eight countries in the Middle East and Africa could affect U.S. carriers such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. The United Kingdom has a similar ban in place for some in-bound flights, although its list of targeted countries differs from that of the United States.

The ban was introduced in March over fears that bombs or explosive materials could be concealed on small electronic devices brought onboard. The nine airlines affected are Royal Jordanian, EgyptAir, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways. The ban does not prevent passengers from checking laptops and other electronic devices into luggage holds.

Still, the move could lead to fewer bookings and would complicate passengers' travel plans. The U.S. is a major destination for Europe-originated flights, with more than 10 million travelers flying there each year from destinations across the continent.

Cellphones would still be allowed in cabins but virtually every other electronic device would not be permitted. One issue that has become a focus for security officials is how to make sure that lithium batteries used in laptops aren't turned into bombs that can be detonated mid-air even if when stored in luggage holds.

WASHINGTON – Attorney General Jeff Sessions is directing federal prosecutors to seek ""the most serious'' criminal charges against suspects, a move that would result in severe prison sentences – and is expected to reverse recent declines in the overcrowded federal prison system.



The brief, two-page directive, issued to the 94 U.S. attorneys offices across the country late Thursday, replaces a 2013 memo put in place by then-Attorney General Eric Holder that sought to limit the use of mandatory-minimum sentencing rules that had condemned some non-violent offenders to long prison terms – that proved to be expensive for taxpayers.

Justice officials said the new policy would not target low-level drug offenders, unless they were linked to firearms, gang membership or other aggravating crimes.

""This policy affirms our responsibility to enforce the law, is moral and just, and produces consistency,'' Sessions said in the directive. ""This policy fully utilizes the tools Congress has given us. By definition, the most serious offenses are those that carry the most substantial... sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences.''

Under the plan, ten-year mandatory minimum sentences would typically be sought in cases where suspects were in possession of 1 kilogram of heroin (equal to thousands of doses); 5 kilograms of cocaine (about 11 pounds); or 1,000 kilograms of marijuana (more than 2,000 pounds).

""There will be circumstances in which good judgment would lead a prosecutor to conclude that a strict application of... the charging policy is not warranted,'' Sessions said. But such exercises of discretion, the attorney general said, would be subject to high-level approval.

Justice officials already have alerted federal prison officials that the action, in conjunction with the administration's recently announced increase in immigration prosecutions, would likely result in a larger prison population.

Last month, Sessions directed federal prosecutors to bring felony charges against immigrants suspected of making repeated illegal entries to the United States. Undocumented entry cases have been previously charged as misdemeanors.

During the Obama administration, Holder's policy had sought to reduce the size of the federal prison system that has long been a financial drag on the Justice Department, representing about 25% of its budget. That policy echoed shifts in law enforcement policy that had been sweeping the states in recent years. State officials have increasingly acknowledged that they can no longer bear the cost of warehousing offenders – many for drug crimes – who were targets of harsh punishments which began decades ago.

The number of sentenced prisoners in federal custody fell by 7,981 inmates – or 5% – between the end of 2009 and 2015, according to a January Pew Research Center analysis. Preliminary figures for 2016 show the decline continued during Obama’s last full year in office and that the overall reduction during his tenure will likely exceed 5%, the center found.

The federal prison population now stands at nearly 190,000 inmates.

President Trump (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)

WASHINGTON — In a flood of angry tweets Friday morning, President Trump threatened the press and James Comey personally as he continues to grapple with the fallout from his abrupt firing of his FBI director and the conflicting stories he and his aides have told about it.

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump said in a tweet that he followed up in a second missive: ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

...Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy??? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

As for the former FBI director, Trump tweeted: ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

It is not known whether Trump tapes his conversations.

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

In a striking reversal one day earlier, Trump told NBC News that he planned to fire Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance.

""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"" who led the agency into turmoil.

He also specifically brought up the ongoing Russia investigation. ""In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself – I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC. ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""

These reasons contradicted the White House's assertions — and even the widely disseminated termination letter Trump sent Comey — that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who criticized Comey's handling of the email investigation into Hillary Clinton last year.

Trump's statements raised even more questions about his decision to fire the FBI director who was running an investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 presidential election.

That coverage of the Comey story prompted the Friday tweetstorm from the president, who also continued to loudly deny that he or his team had anything to do with Russia's hacking Democrats during the 2016 election.

While Democrats continue to decry the timing of Comey's firing was a way to short-circuit the ongoing counterintelligence probe, Trump tweeted that is is all politics: ""Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.""

Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

In yet another tweet, Trump called the investigation into his campaign associates’ ties to Russia a “witch hunt,” insisting that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said there was no collusion.

When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Clapper has said the intelligence community’s report on Russian hacking, which he oversaw, did not include any any evidence of collusion. Clapper also said he was unaware of the ongoing FBI investigation itself until Comey disclosed it publicly in March. But that's not the same thing as saying, definitively, that no collusion took place.

In his short termination letter to Comey, Trump made a specific point of mentioning that he ""appreciated"" how the FBI told him three times he was not personally under investigation over Russia. He later elaborated those conversations took place twice in phone calls and once at a private dinner with the FBI director.

FBI officials have questioned Trump's claims, and the agency' acting director, Andrew McCabe, on Thursday said such assurances about the scope of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation would not be ""standard practice.''

In an earlier tweet, the president returned to one of his favorite subjects – the media: ""The Fake Media is working overtime today!""

The Fake Media is working overtime today! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Trump has frequently attacked the press during his four months in office. He's made cracks about ""fake media"" and threatened to change libel laws. But this appears to be the first time he has gone so far as to threaten to do away with briefings altogether, though briefly during the presidential transition, Trump aides had discussed moving press out of the briefing room.

News of firing took many White House officials by surprise, forcing them to scramble to provide explanations that proceeded to change in the hours and days after the news broke.

Typically, when presidents make decisions of this magnitude, there's a clear plan in place to communicate that decision to the press — and the American public. Comey is only the second director to be fired in the 82-year history of the FBI, and some journalists found it remarkable that there seemed to be such confusion at the White House among key aides.

The White House fired Comey with no replacement set, with no clear messaging and no legal experts or surrogates lined up. — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) May 10, 2017

3,North Korea writes rare letter to House protesting new sanctions,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The Central Intelligence Agency has created a Korea Mission Center in response to the rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. Buzz60

A North Korean parliamentary committee made a rare move Friday, sending a letter of protest to the U.S. House of Representatives over its new package of sanctions.

The missive comes as Pyongyang has been in high-outrage mode for weeks after President Trump threatened the reclusive nation with military action over its ballistic and nuclear weapons tests, and over North Korea's claims it thwarted a CIA plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong Un with a bomb laced with chemical weapons.

The committee denounced the sanctions as ""the most heinous act against humanity that not only infringes upon the sacred sovereignty of (North Korea) but also arbitrarily violates universal principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries which run through the United Nations Charter."" North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency published the letter.

Since North Korea and the United States have no formal diplomatic relations and virtually no official channels of communication, it was not immediately clear how the letter was dispatched — if it was sent by mail, email — or even how it was addressed. The was also no immediate word on whether it had been received.

Pyongyang regularly uses pugnacious rhetoric to condemn moves by Washington to censure its activities. A direct complaint to Congress is uncommon.

The parliamentary foreign affairs committee responsible for the letter had been mothballed for almost two decades. Kim recently revived it, a move that could be interpreted as an attempt by Pyongyang to create a “window” for contacts with the outside world, especially with Seoul and Washington, Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Dongguk University, told the Associated Press.

The House on May 4 voted overwhelmingly in favor of the sanctions that target North Korea's shipping industry and its use of ""slave labor"" — goods produced by forced labor. Before the sanctions can be implemented, the U.S. Senate will need to approve them, a procedural point apparently lost on North Korea's leadership.

""The U.S. House of Representatives should think twice,"" the foreign affairs committee of the North’s Supreme People’s Assembly said in its letter. ""As (the House) enacts more and more of these reckless hostile laws, the DPRK's efforts to strengthen nuclear deterrents will gather greater pace, beyond anyone's imagination,"" it added, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's formal name.

Amid rising tensions that have brought North Korea and the U.S. to the brink of war, the CIA said this week it created a Korea Mission Center at its headquarters in Langley, Va. CIA Director Mike Pompeo said the center ""reflects the dynamism and agility that CIA brings to evolving national security challenges.""

North Korea's Central Public Prosecutors Office released a separate statement Friday via state-run media calling for ""relevant authorities to immediately detect and arrest and hand over to the DPRK the masterminds of the hideous state-sponsored crime, accomplices and their followers.""

The statement appeared to suggest that North Korea believes South Korea and the U.S. are harboring suspects related to the alleged assassination plot.

And to help the famous centenarian celebrate, the city presented him with two special gifts.

At Overton's birthday luncheon, Mayor Steve Adler declared May 11, 2017, as Richard Overton Day in the city of Austin.

""I'm proud to get that, I ain't ever had one in my life,"" said Overton.

""It's just so amazing to be able to look at him, all this knowledge that he has in his mind just so much history,"" said cousin Shimanda Piper. ""He doesn't take any medicine, it's amazing.""

Overton told KVUE the secret to his long life is cigars and whiskey.

""How many cigars have you had this morning?"" a friend asked Overton.

""About 3 or 4, y'all have been holding me down,"" said Overton. ""I always drink a little bit, it's kept me alive, I've been living so long.""

16,7 simple ways to save money online,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Tech columnist Kim Komando talks about easy ways to save money online which in the long run will benefit your pockets and fatten up your piggies belly. Kim Komando Special for USA Today

Do you really need a 'smart' panini maker? Here are tips to saving money online. (Photo: Image Source, Getty Images)

You probably remember that problem from high school math class: If you saved $5 a day and invested it at a nominal interest rate, you’d make $147,000 after 35 years. The point your math teacher was trying to make was that little amounts add up.

But you don’t have to stick a $5 bill in a jar. The virtual universe is full of deals, and shrewd Internet habits could lead to big savings over time. You don’t even have to sacrifice simple pleasures like music and video games; you can just obtain them in a smarter and more economical way.

By the way, if you’ve avoided budgeting and managing your money because it’s too cumbersome, depressing or difficult, new apps and programs make it manageable and maybe even, dare I say, fun. More on the best budgeting and finance software.

So how do you cut corners? Here are seven simple ways to save money on the internet.

1. Use online coupons

Most people hear the word “coupon” and roll their eyes. It’s tedious, snipping out little squares from the Sunday newspaper and then handing them over to a cashier. But online, this process is much easier. Visit sites like RetailMeNot or CouponCodes, and you’ll have access to discounts on everyday products. Codes work for a diverse selection of retailers, including Walmart, Target, Sears, and Macy’s. When you check out, you’ll see the words “promo code.” Just copy and paste your code into the field, and that’s it. You’ll be astounded by the rewards you can reap.

Meanwhile, Amazon has an entire section of its website dedicated to coupons. Here, you can find discounts in specific categories, such as groceries, electronics, and office supplies. The coupons get even more enticing for Prime Members. Get coupons on Amazon while you shop.

2. Get free music (or even rent it)

Pandora is one of the services for free music. (Photo: Pandora)

Twenty years ago, it was hard to imagine CDs vanishing from shelves, but today it’s hard to even find a physical music store. Now, we may be entering a new phase. Music fans may not have to buy music at all.

Music subscription services like Spotify and Pandora have huge libraries containing millions and millions of songs. They’re basically an all-you-can-eat buffet of artists and albums. For a limited selection and quality, you can sign up for free, and many listeners will be satisfied this robust offering. But for the full experience, a subscription to either service will give you access to all the latest hits.

It gets better if you’re already an Amazon Prime member. Many people enjoy their first year of Prime without ever knowing they can download music for free. Yes, you can stream songs, but you can also choose from more than a million MP3s to keep on your phone or computer.

3. Avoid in-game purchases

For years, the routine was the same: Gamers went to a store, bought a game, and took it home. When new consoles came out, gamers upgraded. Some rented games from the video store (remember those?) but the console game prices were pretty consistent.

That’s why the “in-game purchase” is such an alarming trend. You can play to a certain point, and then you have to wait or pay to proceed. It’s a splash of the cold water in an otherwise exciting experience. Apps are notorious for this practice.

Instead of paying to skip a level, get more points, or gain additional lives in a game, Google search the game’s title and the level you are attempting to master. There are sites that list exactly what you need to do to avoid paying the game developer. Best of all, the steps are free.

4. Skip the crazy gadgets

Some of these gadgets can be fun, especially if you give them as tongue-in-cheek gifts, but who actually needs a “smart” Panini maker? Is your roommate really such a jerk that you need an “ice cream lock”? And although it may be colorful, who could sleep with a “light-up pillow”?

Worse are the “proof-of-concept” projects that start their lives on crowd-funding sites like Kickstarter. Many never see the light of day, and you may lose your pledge money without ever seeing a finished product.

5. Redeem those rebates

Yes, rebates used to be a pain. Why would you mail a form in, when you don’t remember the last time you licked a stamp? Some shoppers are young enough not to know the difference between a coupon and a rebate. To refresh: Coupons are used at the time of purchase and are instantaneous. Rebates can only be redeemed after the purchase of an item, usually at full price.

But now rebates can be easy. Amazon has a special section for checking if an item you have purchased qualifies for a rebate. Manufacturers, wireless service providers, merchants, and other companies on Amazon.com use mail-in rebates to offer the best possible price on new items.

You’ll need your order number and email address handy, and make sure to keep the packing slip when your order is delivered. You’ll use these documents to complete the online rebate form. Rebates may take 12 to 15 weeks to process, but they’re another way to get cash back. Read more information about Amazon rebates.

6. Watch your smart phone’s data

Smartphones are more powerful than ever, enabling you to use GPS, Skype friends in Japan, and stream videos while sitting on a boat in the middle of a bay. These are amazing features, of course, but they also devour your data.

If you don’t have an unlimited data plan, you may run out of juice before your next billing cycle. This is the kiss of death for smartphone users. Buying more data is generally expensive, and you’re forced to add a gig or two because your phone is useless otherwise.

My suggestion is to either secure an unlimited data plan, especially if you use heavyweight apps on the go, or just carefully watch your data. You can always track how much data you have left, either through your phone’s settings or by downloading your provider’s app. 5 ways to drastically reduce your smartphone’s data usage.

7. Wait to upgrade your phone

Waiting to upgrade your phone can yield big cost savings. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)

You don’t have to tell me: Phones get better every year. Every incarnation comes with its exciting new features, like improved battery life and camera resolution. So once the next iPhone or Galaxy becomes available, why should you wait to snatch it from the display case?

For one, it’s expensive. The people who camp overnight in front of the Apple store don’t mind spending up to $1,000 on the latest model, but most of us don’t have the spare capital. If your phone is working nicely and it’s still in good physical condition, there’s no particular reason to upgrade.

Bonus: Buy your modem or router

Buying a router or modem, rather than renting one from your service provider, can save you money. (Photo: Linksys)

Too many people make the mistake of renting a modem and router from their service provider. Sure, the rental fee for modems and routers is usually nominal, about $6 per month, but after four years of service, that adds up to $288.

You can find a very decent router through Best Buy or Amazon for under $100. Better yet, buy your router based on the features you want. Not all routers are created equal. Some are faster; others are better known for security.

There are a few considerations, though: First, your internet service provider may not let you use a store-bought router or modem. Second, you may have to figure out how to install the devices yourself, and not everybody wants to deal with that. Finally, do you expect to use the same service provider for more than a year?

The same advice applies to your modem. You’re better off buying that too. How to buy the best modem.

Promoting a new album is hard work, and for Harry Styles, that work involves gamely commenting on One Direction fan-fiction theories.

""Oh, is that a thing?"" he said, amused by the supposed link between his new song Sweet Creature and his 1D bandmate Louis Tomlinson. ""Well, whatever it is that it makes one feel. But I think if you listen to the lyrics, you can work out what it’s about.""

Styles' charming, British-accented modesty aside, the 23-year-old One Direction singer is poised to become one of the world's biggest pop stars with the release of his self-titled debut album (out Friday), a collection of music that Styles describes as “songs about stories, and another group of songs delving into, ‘Why did I feel like that.’”

His first single Sign of the Times was a Biblically-epic debut, drawing comparisons to David Bowie and Elton John, a logical progression from the classic-rock nostalgia heard on One Direction's final two albums. But Styles, and his similarly-aged fans, grew up in an era of music where genre distinctions have melted together, and his album spends just as much time dabbling in twangy folk and modern alt-pop than the stadium-rock of his former band.

“I was very much working out what I wanted the album to be up until picking the tracklisting, and I wanted people to go through that with me when listening to that, instead of picking a sound and writing ten of the same things,” he said.

And when he does name-drop a classic rock icon, he opts for a figure known more for classic songwriting than sheer starpower. “I listened to a lot of Harry Nilsson while making the album,” he said. “His lyrics are honest, and so good, and I think it’s because he’s never trying to sound clever.”

Making the album was ""like therapy"" for Styles, who explained, ""It’s so much easier saying something to an instrument than it is to a person."" And time and again when talking about his music, Styles returns to this Nilsson-esque theme of honesty, which he saw as less a goal on his album and more a responsibility. “I really didn’t want to be editing lyrics and pulling stuff out,” he said. “I kind of decided early on, that every time I said to myself, ‘Can I say this?’ I wanted to say yes.’”

As a result, Harry Styles is packed with flashbacks and allusions, with references to wild nights and inside jokes that seem coded for the people who inspired the tracks to hear. Styles himself has been the subject of these kinds of songs, his fans sleuthing out clues in lyrics from his former fling Taylor Swift. However, unlike Swift’s coy admissions to the press about her inspirations, Styles declines to drop any hints.

“I’ve never really felt like I’ve had to explain my personal life,” he said. “ And I love that with writing, you get to wrap it up with a song. I understand that people will dissect stuff like that, which is amazing, that people care enough about you to try and figure out what it means.”

That includes Sweet Creature, a sweetly-strummed ode to a person that Styles won't disclose. . “The fun thing is, you can write a love song that’s not always in the traditional sense — it doesn’t always have to be romantic or even about a person at all, if you don’t want,” he said.

And Harry Styles’ most nontraditional love story happens to be its best. Among the many other young songwriters to claim Harry Nilsson as an influence was Elliott Smith, whose achingly-intimate acoustic melodies are an unmistakable influence on Harry Styles’ final song From the Dining Table, which opens with this line, “Woke up alone in this hotel room, played with myself where were you / Fell back asleep, got drunk by noon, I've never felt less cool.”

""I’d say it’s the most honest I’ve been, I’ve never written and recorded a song like that,” Styles said about the track, which “came at a time when any barrier of editing myself had been stripped away. I never do anything while listening to it, it’s a song that makes me stop and listen rather than doing something and having it on in the background.”

Yet, Styles chooses his words carefully when asked whether the song, a lonely snapshot of a drunk kid in a hotel room, is a comment on fame, saying he has “no complaints” about his life. As always, he knows the rest of the world is listening.

“I feel very lucky to be able to travel and play music and work in music,” he said. “But for me, my favorite artists’ songs aren’t the ones where they’re talking about how great their life is, they're not the stories you want to hear. You want to know why they chose to be alone somewhere, I think that’s the stuff that makes you feel something. (That’s) way more interesting than them telling me they had champagne for dinner.""

9,The Spurs' Game 6 win was the ultimate proof Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate | FOX Sports,"In case that were still up for debate (you know, since the polling closed a month ago), San Antonio's Game 6 blowout of the Houston Rockets with Leonard on the bench served as all the evidence you need.

With Leonard on the sideline, the Spurs played a classic, Spurs-ian game. They moved the ball on offense, finding the open man and punishing the smaller Rockets on the interior. At one point, Houston had 64 total points, while San Antonio had 54 points in the paint alone.

This is no indictment of Leonard, no matter what some might tell you. (If anything, the result showed how valuable James Harden is to the Rockets. When he vanishes while somehow leaving his corporeal form behind, Houston is doomed.) In fact, credit LaMarcus Aldridge for playing within himself and the Spurs' natural offensive flow. He would have looked right at home on the championship-winning teams that beat LeBron James' Miami Heat.

Yet that's the point. The Spurs haven't had that same freedom of movement with Leonard running the offense this season, because he's learning on the job. He's learning quickly, sure, but he's not quite at the elite level as a primary offensive option that so many people think he is.

He's still adding pieces to his game — exploring what it means to be the creator on offense and the destroyer on defense, while trying to strike the balance between the two — and managing to play like one of the NBA's very best players along the way.

You can be incredibly valuable, getting better, and not be the MVP. There's some grey area left in this world, right?",fox-sports

It wasn’t all rookies at the event, as the team asked 10-time Pro Bowl tackle Joe Thomas – the longest-tenured Brown – to attend.

Tight end David Njoku, one of Cleveland’s three first-round picks, probably wishes his first meeting with Thomas went a little bit differently because it was definitely awkward. He thought Thomas was a coach, which I guess is an honest mistake.

9,"David Ortiz rips 'arrogant' Bobby Valentine, calls 2012 'worst season of my career' | FOX Sports","Five years later, the Bobby Valentine era in Boston – which lasted only one season – still is a sore spot for everyone from Red Sox fans to David Ortiz. In his upcoming book, Big Papi chronicles that disappointing 2012 season and throws some serious shade at his former manager.

Valentine was fired following that 69-93 campaign, as the team posted its highest loss total since 1965 – before winning the World Series in 2013 under new manager John Farrell. But it’s that 2012 season that still irks Ortiz, who chronicled his failed relationship with Bobby V in “Papi: My Story,” an excerpt of which can be found at SI.com.

Ortiz admittedly didn’t know Valentine before that season but decided to keep an open mind, despite plenty of warnings from those within the sport. But it didn’t take long for Big Papi to form his own opinions, and they weren’t positive (see: “aggravating as hell, arrogant and disrespectful”). Among the highlights:

* “It was all about [Valentine] in the spring. It was as if he wanted to prove how smart he was by running us through all these drills he’d used while managing in Japan, drills we had never done before. Bobby was in his own bubble, and I just wanted to get him out of it and tell him, “[Expletive] you.”

* [Dustin Pedroia, Adrián González and I] decided to meet with Bobby in his office and attempt to tell him how he was being perceived. It was a waste of time. We tried reasoning with him, and it was like communicating with a wall. All he did was roll his eyes and look everywhere but at us. It could not have been more obvious that he didn’t care what we had to say. We left his office shaking our heads.”

* “I thought that I would never have to hear from Bobby Valentine again after ownership fired him one day after the season ended. Of course, Bobby didn’t know how to leave town quietly.

“I’d heard that he was going to be on TV with Bob Costas, talking about his time in Boston and other things. I watched the whole thing and was shocked when I saw him tell Costas that I had quit on him and the Red Sox. All season long I was the one who had defended him, who had tried to have his back, even when it was an unpopular stance to take as far as my teammates were concerned. But it was the right thing to do, and now he had the balls to go on national TV and suggest that I quit?

“Days later, he tried to call me and apologize. I didn’t want to hear it. We had already made a trade with Toronto to bring back John Farrell to be our new manager. I knew him, kind of. Farrell had been our pitching coach when we won the World Series in 2007. When we traded for him, no one called or texted to say “good luck.” I figured we were in good hands.”

Ouch.

9,The 20 most annoying players in the NBA right now | FOX Sports,"Because ""annoying"" can be a skill set.

More often than not, “annoying” is a good thing in professional sports.

Being “annoying” means being disruptive, messing up someone else’s flow and generally mucking up the works of an otherwise smooth-running machine.

You can get paid a lot of money as an annoying-ass basketball player, and even win your team a championship by virtue of your sheer ability to make the guys wearing different color jerseys too uncomfortable to function.

Annoying can be valuable. Annoying can also be plain, no-good annoying.

With that said, the following are the 20 most “annoying"" players currently in the NBA. This is a cadre of irritators, bamboozlers and straight-up jerks from all across the usefulness spectrum in the league.

Some are on-court irritants, others annoy via personality, off-court antics and general aura. But they are all extremely effective jerk-faces in their own special ways.",fox-sports

6,Comey was taken aback by Trump request for loyalty pledge,"Washington (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey was ""taken aback"" by President Donald Trump's request for a personal assurance or pledge of loyalty at a dinner shortly after he took office, a source close to Comey told CNN Friday.

Comey refused to do so, saying he could not provide such a pledge -- those who work at the FBI pledge their loyalty to the US Constitution, not to any individual person -- but he promised to always be honest with the President.

Trump then asked if Comey would pledge ""honest loyalty,"" to which the FBI director agreed. The source said the term ""honest loyalty"" doesn't necessarily mean anything.

The late January dinner was arranged at Trump's request, the source added.

A description of the dinner and conversation was first reported Thursday night by The New York Times, although CNN had previously reported Comey's refusal to give Trump any assurance of personal loyalty.

6,Donald Trump threatened James Comey via Twitter. This is not a test.,"Washington (CNN) Just 72 hours after his shocking decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to warn Comey not to share the contents of their private conversations .

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!

Where to begin.

First, the facts. What we have here is the President of the United States openly threatening the recently-deposed FBI director to stay silent. At issue, primarily, is the claim made by Trump that Comey told him, on three separate occasions, that he was not under investigation. That would represent a major breach of protocol on Comey's part and would raise serious questions about conflicts of interest -- the same sort of questions that led then Attorney General Loretta Lynch to recuse herself from the Clinton email investigation after former President Bill Clinton boarded a plane to talk to her

Comey has yet to speak publicly about Trump's claims but his allies, without their names attached, have described the idea that he would have told the President that he wasn't under investigation as ""literally farcical,"" according to a report in the Wall Street Journal

Trump seems very interested in keeping Comey silent. Which raises all sorts of questions. Does Trump know Comey knows things that would undercut his assertions about either their conversations, the ongoing Russia investigation or something else? Does Trump really believe the best way to keep Comey quiet is to publicly threaten him? If so, why?

Then there is the fact that Trump insinuates that he did -- or could -- tape conversations with Comey, giving him a way to prove, theoretically, that he is telling the truth (and Comey isn't) about their conversations.

The last president who taped his conversations was a guy named Richard Milhous Nixon. (Regular taping of phone calls made by the president has been largely verboten since then; read this amazing piece by Yahoo's Olivier Knox on that .) It didn't end all that well for Nixon if you remember.

That Trump would invoke the specter of Nixon at the end of this week is truly startling. His dismissal of Comey led to a slew of comparisons to Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had been appointed by Congress to look into the Watergate break-in. Less than 24 hours later, Trump did a surprise photo-op with Henry Kissinger, who served as Nixon's Secretary of State.

I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Truly.

It's not clear from the wording of Trump's tweet whether he actually was taping conversations with Comey or simply using the idea of doing so as a sort of Sword of Damocles to hang over the head of the former FBI director. Either way, it's very strange, to say the least.

It's difficult to see a strategy in all of this. Trump spent Thursday directly contradicting the story his staff had constructed about why Comey was fired . He spent Friday morning insisting that he is so active that his staff can't be expected to know or tell the whole truth in the daily press briefing and threatening the former FBI director into silence.

While all of Trump's presidency -- the entire 112 days of it -- has had a lurching, zig-zag feel to it, the last 72 hours -- and, especially, the last 24 -- feel even more erratic and unpredictable. Where can Trump possibly go from here?",cnn
6,Fact check: Why did President Trump fire FBI Director James Comey?,"In this Jan. 22, 2017, file photo, President Trump shakes hands with James Comey during an Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House. (Photo: Andrew Harrer, Pool/Getty Images)

Why did President Trump fire FBI Director James Comey? The president and top administration officials have offered contradictory accounts in recent days:

The official White House statement on May 9 said Trump “acted based on the clear recommendations” of the attorney general and deputy attorney general. But Trump, in an interview two days later, said he was going to fire Comey “regardless of recommendation.”

Trump said the “FBI has been in turmoil,” and a White House spokeswoman said “the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence” in Comey. “That is not accurate,” according to Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who said Comey “enjoyed broad support within the FBI, and still does to this day.”

The Rosenstein Memo

Trump fired Comey on May 9. The White House issued a statement saying, “President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.”

Rosenstein wrote a two-and-a-half page memo with the subject line “Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI” that stated the reasons why Comey should be removed. The memo cited Comey’s “handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [Hillary] Clinton’s emails.” Rosenstein criticized Comey for holding a press conference on July 5, 2016, to publicly announce his recommendation not to charge Clinton, and for announcing on Oct. 28, 2016, that the FBI had reopened its investigation of Clinton.

Comey’s firing came less than two months after the director confirmed at a congressional hearing on March 20 that the bureau is investigating “whether there was any coordination between the [Trump] campaign and Russia’s efforts” to influence the 2016 presidential election.

In January, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified intelligence report that found “Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election” with the goal of hurting Clinton and helping to elect Trump.

Democrats have criticized the timing of Comey’s firing, because of the ongoing investigation. But Trump administration officials said the decision had nothing to do with Russia.

On the night of Comey’s firing, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, “Why fire James Comey now?” She cited Rosenstein’s letter and his bipartisan credentials, noting that he was overwhelmingly confirmed as deputy attorney general.

Conway, May 9: ""Well, I would point them to the three letters that were received today, Anderson, the letter by President Donald Trump and letter by Attorney General Sessions and really the underlying report by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who the FBI director reports to, the FBI director traditionally reports to the deputy attorney general. Rod Rosenstein was confirmed just 14 days ago by a vote of 94 to 6 by United States senators. He’s well-respected across both sides of the aisle. He served as U.S. attorney in Maryland under President Obama. And he sent out a memo today to the attorney general and the re line, Anderson, says 'restoring public confidence in the FBI.' ""

Conway said Trump “took the recommendation of his deputy attorney general, who oversees the FBI director.”

Later in the interview, Cooper said that “a lot of people are … saying it destroys people’s confidence in the FBI” and its ability to investigate whether Trump aides colluded with Russia to interfere in last year’s election. Conway said the firing “had zero to do” with Russia and “everything to do with … Mr. Rosenstein.”

The next morning, on CNN’s New Day, Conway repeated the claim: “The president took the advice of the deputy attorney general who oversees the director of the FBI, brought those concerns to the attorney general who brought them to the president. And they made a decision to remove him.”

On MSNBC’s Morning Joe that same morning, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders echoed the official White House statement and Conway’s remarks when she was asked why Comey was fired.

Sanders, May 10: ""I think he’s heard from the rank and file of the FBI, but particularly someone who had done a thorough review and someone who has the respect and reputation that the deputy attorney general has, he took that seriously. He took the recommendation seriously. And he made a decision based on that.""

Trump, however, told NBC’s Lester Holt in a May 11 interview that he did not base his decision on Rosenstein’s recommendation.

Holt, May 11: ""Monday you met with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein."" Trump: ""Right."" Holt: ""Did you ask for a recommendation?"" Trump: ""What I did is, I was going to fire Comey. My decision. It was not —"" Holt: ""You had made the decision before they came in the room."" Trump: ""I was going to fire Comey. There’s no good time to do it, by the way."" Holt: ""Because in your letter you said, 'I accepted their recommendation.'"" Trump: ""Well, they also —"" Holt: ""So, you had already made the decision."" Trump: ""Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.""

The president told Holt, “The FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn’t recovered from that.”

Comey’s ‘Broad Support’ Within FBI

Trump and others in the administration have repeatedly made the claim that Comey had lost the confidence and respect of the FBI’s rank and file.

In addition to Trump saying the FBI has been in “turmoil,” Conway on CNN’s New Day said that “Jim Comey had lost the confidence of people at the FBI.”

At a May 10 press briefing, Sanders said the president, members of Congress and the Department of Justice had lost confidence in Comey. “And most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director,” Sanders said.

McCabe — a 21-year FBI official who assumed the position of acting FBI director when Comey was fired — was asked about Sanders’ remark at a May 11 hearing of the Senate intelligence committee. “No, sir, that is not accurate,” he said.

McCabe called working with Comey “the greatest privilege and honor of my professional life.”

McCabe, May 11: ""I can tell you also that Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI, and still does to this day. We are a large organization. We are 36,500 people across this country, across this globe. We have a diversity of opinions about many things. But I can confidently tell you that the majority — the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.""

A day earlier, former FBI Deputy General Counsel Ernie Babcock told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Comey “created an atmosphere of integrity and transparency, and, unfortunately, being transparent is now becoming a political football and one side or the other will not be happy if you actually do your job.”

Tapper, May 10: ""How was morale at the FBI under Comey when you were there?"" Babcock: ""It was outstanding. Jim Comey is an inclusive leader. He would not make and did not make critical decisions on his own as some other leaders do. He brought the senior staff together on a regular basis and included them in making any of the difficult decisions.""

This is obviously a developing story and more information likely will emerge.

But what we know right now is that the White House’s initial claim that the president acted based on Rosenstein’s recommendation has been contradicted by the president himself. And its portrayal of Comey as having lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file is at best a matter of dispute.

16,Workers to recruiters: Make me an offer,"Nearly half of all workers in leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants, switched jobs the past year. (Photo: Josh T. Reynolds, for USA TODAY)

America’s workers are on the move.

With the low unemployment rate giving workers more leverage than they’ve had in years, a surprisingly large number are either job hopping or on the lookout for new opportunities.

About 27% of employees switched jobs in the 12 months ending in the first quarter, according to payroll processor ADP, the most since the firm began tracking the figure in 2014. Three years ago, about 23% of workers left one job for another during the prior year. ADP compiles labor market data based on the 24 million U.S. employees whose employers contract with ADP to handle their payrolls,

Some areas of the labor market are havens for job switchers. Nearly half of all leisure and hospitality workers and one-third of those in professional and business services changed jobs the past year.

Not surprisingly, job hoppers are snaring bigger pay increases than their more loyal colleagues. In the first quarter, switchers who worked full-time realized average annual earnings gains of 5.2%, compared with 4.3% for full-time job holders.

“As the labor market tightens, employees have more power,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of ADP’s research institute. The 4.4% unemployment rate has resulted in a smaller pool of idle workers, forcing firms to bid up to lure employees from other companies.

One reason businesses should be nervous: 63% of workers are open to making a switch, according to a separate national survey of 2,156 employees that ADP conducted. Seventeen percent are actively looking while 46% are receptive to an overture from a recruiter.

Related:

Yet employers are a bit too complacent. Those surveyed believe only 49% of their employees are in the market, according to their average estimate. “There’s a disconnect,” Ahu said. “Employers really have to think about how to attract, how to engage, and how to retain employees.”

Alfredo Rodriguez, 29, of Denver, took an entry-level marketing job with a local mortgage company in September 2015. Within a year he landed interviews for two higher-level positions and received offers for both. He accepted a position as marketing coordinator for a national mortgage firm, snagging about a 20% raise. He said he decided to start job-hunting after hearing from friends and college classmates about an abundance of openings.

“I got a little bit of a sense there were more jobs out there,” he said.

ADP’s survey found that, all else equal, a 13% bump in pay would be enough to coax an employee to switch jobs, based on respondents’ average estimate.

Yet money isn’t necessarily the chief reason employees bolt.

Work Institute, a research firm, found that 22% of employees left their jobs last year for career development, followed by work life balance (12%), management behavior (11%), compensation and benefits (9%), and well-being (9%). Its findings were based on analysis of more than 34,000 exit interviews.

Millennials are especially antsy, with an average job tenure of less than three years, according to Tony Lee, who manages talent acquisition issues for the Society for Human Resource Management.

Since many firms have limited ability to increase pay, they should find other ways to reward workers in today’s hyper-competitive market, Lee said. Those include flexible hours, the option to work at home and even awards that shouldn’t wait until employees reach their fifth or 10th or 25th anniversaries. Lee says.

“If people feel they're being recognized, they're less likely to go somewhere else to look for” that acknowledgment, he says.

9,Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe react to James Harden’s Game 6 meltdown | FOX Sports,"Harden had the biggest meltdown since LeBron in 2011

“This was the biggest superstar meltdown we have witnessed since LeBron James in the 2011 NBA finals. No Kawhi Leonard. No Tony Parker – both of whom were NBA Finals MVPs. All the pressure was on the home team to hold serve with no Kawhi and get it back to san Antonio for Game 7. And right on cue, James Harden unraveled under that pressure. Couldn’t even take a shot for the first quarter and a half. And the truth is, it was pretty predictable. James harden has always had some LeBron in him. When the lights are brightest and the stakes are highest, he tends to shrink or melt under that pressure. I don’t even call it choking in Harden’s case because choking is what happens when you miss a last-second shot. This is big picture. This is disappearing, shrinking melting.

16,Harry Styles interview: Writing his new album was 'like therapy',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Harry Styles opens up in an interview about his new solo album. USA TODAY

Promoting a new album is hard work, and for Harry Styles, that work involves gamely commenting on One Direction fan-fiction theories.

""Oh, is that a thing?"" he said, amused by the supposed link between his new song Sweet Creature and his 1D bandmate Louis Tomlinson. ""Well, whatever it is that it makes one feel. But I think if you listen to the lyrics, you can work out what it’s about.""

Styles' charming, British-accented modesty aside, the 23-year-old One Direction singer is poised to become one of the world's biggest pop stars with the release of his self-titled debut album (out Friday), a collection of music that Styles describes as “songs about stories, and another group of songs delving into, ‘Why did I feel like that.’”

His first single Sign of the Times was a Biblically-epic debut, drawing comparisons to David Bowie and Elton John, a logical progression from the classic-rock nostalgia heard on One Direction's final two albums. But Styles, and his similarly-aged fans, grew up in an era of music where genre distinctions have melted together, and his album spends just as much time dabbling in twangy folk and modern alt-pop than the stadium-rock of his former band.

“I was very much working out what I wanted the album to be up until picking the tracklisting, and I wanted people to go through that with me when listening to that, instead of picking a sound and writing ten of the same things,” he said.

And when he does name-drop a classic rock icon, he opts for a figure known more for classic songwriting than sheer starpower. “I listened to a lot of Harry Nilsson while making the album,” he said. “His lyrics are honest, and so good, and I think it’s because he’s never trying to sound clever.”

Making the album was ""like therapy"" for Styles, who explained, ""It’s so much easier saying something to an instrument than it is to a person."" And time and again when talking about his music, Styles returns to this Nilsson-esque theme of honesty, which he saw as less a goal on his album and more a responsibility. “I really didn’t want to be editing lyrics and pulling stuff out,” he said. “I kind of decided early on, that every time I said to myself, ‘Can I say this?’ I wanted to say yes.’”

As a result, Harry Styles is packed with flashbacks and allusions, with references to wild nights and inside jokes that seem coded for the people who inspired the tracks to hear. Styles himself has been the subject of these kinds of songs, his fans sleuthing out clues in lyrics from his former fling Taylor Swift. However, unlike Swift’s coy admissions to the press about her inspirations, Styles declines to drop any hints.

“I’ve never really felt like I’ve had to explain my personal life,” he said. “ And I love that with writing, you get to wrap it up with a song. I understand that people will dissect stuff like that, which is amazing, that people care enough about you to try and figure out what it means.”

That includes Sweet Creature, a sweetly-strummed ode to a person that Styles won't disclose. . “The fun thing is, you can write a love song that’s not always in the traditional sense — it doesn’t always have to be romantic or even about a person at all, if you don’t want,” he said.

And Harry Styles’ most nontraditional love story happens to be its best. Among the many other young songwriters to claim Harry Nilsson as an influence was Elliott Smith, whose achingly-intimate acoustic melodies are an unmistakable influence on Harry Styles’ final song From the Dining Table, which opens with this line, “Woke up alone in this hotel room, played with myself where were you / Fell back asleep, got drunk by noon, I've never felt less cool.”

""I’d say it’s the most honest I’ve been, I’ve never written and recorded a song like that,” Styles said about the track, which “came at a time when any barrier of editing myself had been stripped away. I never do anything while listening to it, it’s a song that makes me stop and listen rather than doing something and having it on in the background.”

Yet, Styles chooses his words carefully when asked whether the song, a lonely snapshot of a drunk kid in a hotel room, is a comment on fame, saying he has “no complaints” about his life. As always, he knows the rest of the world is listening.

“I feel very lucky to be able to travel and play music and work in music,” he said. “But for me, my favorite artists’ songs aren’t the ones where they’re talking about how great their life is, they're not the stories you want to hear. You want to know why they chose to be alone somewhere, I think that’s the stuff that makes you feel something. (That’s) way more interesting than them telling me they had champagne for dinner.""

LONDON — A number of hospitals and healthcare services across England were hit by an apparent cyberattack Friday, health care authorities said.

Services in London, the central city of Nottingham, and the counties of Hertfordshire — north of London — and Cumbria — in northern England — were affected, according to the BBC. The NHS said 16 of its organisations reported they were victims.

The hackers behind the ""ransomware"" attack were demanding $300 in the electronic currency Bitcoins to release files from encryption, the Mirror and the Telegraph reported.

In a statement, the NHS said: ""A number of NHS organisations have reported to NHS Digital that they have been affected by a ransomware attack which is affecting a number of different organisations. The investigation is at an early stage but we believe the malware variant is Wanna Decryptor.""

""At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected organisations to confirm this.""

It said the attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and was affecting other organizations. It said it was working to resolve the problem.

Hackers behind the Wanna Decryptor virus, a type of malware, often ask victims user for money to retrieve access to files they have encrypted.

NHS Merseyside, which operates a number of hospitals in northwestern England, tweeted, “we are taking all precautionary measures possible to protect our local NHS systems and services.” The NHS Merseyside website was down Friday afternoon local time.

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which runs four hospitals north of London, said in a statement: ""Immediately on discovery of the problem, the trust acted to protect its IT systems by shutting them down; it also meant that the trust’s telephone system is not able to accept incoming calls.”

It said it was postponing all non-urgent work and asked people not to come to the accident and emergency unit.

Doctors at some surgeries were forced to use pen and paper to record patient details following the attack, local media reported.

John Caldwell, a doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian he had “no access to record systems or results.""

Chris Mimnagh, another doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian: “Unable to access our clinical system – as a precaution our area has severed links to the wider NHS, which means no access to our national systems, no computers means no records, no prescriptions, no results, we are dealing with urgent problems only, our patients are being very understanding so far.”

NHS Million, a not-for profit campaign aimed at supporting NHS staff which is separate from the NHS, tweeted: ""We just don't understand the mentality of some people. The only people suffering are people that need emergency care. #nhscyberattack""

9,Aaron Judge's cheering section at Yankee Stadium is as remarkable he is | FOX Sports,"Aaron Judge already is a larger-than-life presence in the Yankees’ batting order in his rookie season, and now he has the fan section to prove it.

Judge, who is 6-foot-7 and 280 pounds, was greeted by a group of fans dressed as judges – complete with those creepy white wigs – during Thursday’s game against the Astros at Yankee Stadium.

According to the New York Daily News, the fans are childhood friends – one even is a Red Sox fan – who came up with the idea in a group text.

“I was watching a game and was like, ‘You know what. Aaron Judge. I don’t see any judges in the stadium. Let’s do it.’ Rally the troops, and they made it happen,” Nick Greenwood, one of Judge’s judges, told the newspaper.

Alas, Judge went 0-for-3 with a strikeout in Thursday’s 3-2 loss to the Astros, but he still leads the AL in homers (13), runs (28) and OPS (1.146).

9,Dale Earnhardt Jr. among drivers hit with penalties at Kansas | FOX Sports,"Dale Earnhardt Jr., already battling a season notable for bad luck and several resulting bad finishes, will have an added challenge this weekend at Kansas Speedway, site of Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 (FS1, 7 p.m. ET).

At Talladega Superspeedway last weekend, Earnhardt’s No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet failed pre-race inspection three times, which means he will lose 15 minutes of practice time on Friday and, more importantly, the team will lose the ability to select a pit stall.

Normally, pit stall selection is based on qualifying results, with the pole-sitting winner getting first choice.

Earnhardt comes into the Kansas race 25th in points in this, his final season before retiring.

But Earnhardt wasn’t the only driver penalized at Kansas.

Kyle Busch and Corey LaJoie were held out of the first 15 minutes of practice for penalties deferred from Talladega.

And Jamie McMurray, Kyle Larson and Chris Buescher each lost 15 minutes of practice time for pre-race inspection issues at Talladega.

Last but not least, Erik Jones lost minutes of practice for missing the rookie meeting.

There are two rounds of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series practice today at 11:30 a.m. ET and 1:30 p.m., with Cup qualifying at 6:45 p.m.

You can use nasal steroids along with an antihistamine tablet to treat nasal congestion, runny nose, and itchy/watery eyes. Unlike the tablets, these can take up to a week to be effective, so you should start taking it before your symptoms get too bad. There are few different formulations (some are more of a light mist, while others are more of a squirt of liquid), so you might need to try a few to see what works best.

BOSTON — Sian-Pierre Regis was in Paris when his mother left him a voicemail that he will never forget: “I just got fired, just want you to know that. Call me. Bye.”

His 75-year-old housekeeper mother, Rebecca Danigelis, had been working in hospitality for as long as Regis could remember.

“We were raised above a hotel,” Regis says. Danigelis raised two boys by herself in Boston, above the hotel that she worked in.

“I was always very aware of the fact that everything she made went into our mouths,” Regis remembers about he and his brother’s upbringing. She cashed out her 401k to help Regis go to college, and he went on to live his dreams, while hers were set aside.

Then she got fired.

Regis decided it was time for his mother to live her dreams. He wanted to help her live her best life, and he wanted them to do it together.

The bucket list

Danigelis had been working on a bucket list of things she’s always wanted to do. “When she got fired,” says Regis, “all these bucket list items took on so much more weight.”

She added a few more items to the list and together they set off to live her dreams.

“There is a spirt within her that I’ve never seen so bright.” Sian-Pierre Regis

Some of the things on her list were pure fun: Take a hip-hop lesson with a dancer from the award-winning Broadway musical Hamilton, join Instagram, milk a cow in Vermont, take a mystery trip.

But some of her bucket list items were deeper and more meaningful to her, like visiting the grave of her sister in England.

Danigelis missed her sister’s funeral because she was working. She couldn’t find someone to cover her shift, so she didn’t attend. Standing over her sister’s grave, she sobbed, saying, “I wish I had come sooner.”

“I could see all the memories of she and her sister flooding towards her, she just felt horrible,” Regis says.

No regrets

Regis says his mother has been reflective about missing out on so many things in her life, but she says she would never change any of it. “She had to put food on the table,” he said. And her boys always were her priority.

As mother and son toured the world, ticking off her bucket list items, the duo has shared many laughs.

“There is a spirit within her that I’ve never seen so bright, she’s 75 but I’ve never seen her younger than in these moments,” Regis says.

Next chapter

This dynamic duo isn’t done with mom’s bucket list. Danigelis has yet to skydive or walk the Boston Marathon route, something she plans on doing with both her sons. She is actively looking for a job in hospitality, but says she is having trouble finding an employer who is seeking someone her age.

Regis has filmed their adventure since the beginning, hoping to share his mother’s struggle with the world, but also give her something she can cherish forever. “She’s always wanted to write a memoir,” Regis says. “So many people in their day-to-day jobs render that dream impossible, but now through this film, she’s able to tell her story and be in control of this story.”

They will continue completing items on mom’s bucket list through the end of 2017. Regis has launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for production costs for his mother's film, which they've titled Duty Free.

In the meantime, follow her adventures on Instagram and Facebook. And if you see Danigelis painting a picture of her neighborhood in Boston’s Back Bay, know that she’s fulfilling another one of her dreams.

Spicey — with the help of his motorized podium — is hitting the road.

On Friday morning, some lucky New York commuters spotted Melissa McCarthy dressed as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who she frequently plays on Saturday Night Live, zooming around the city's streets on the moving podium that's made an appearance in several of her cameos.

McCarthy wasn't just taking a joyride. The actress returns to SNL this weekend as guest host, and a camera crew accompanied her NYC jaunt, seemingly filming a short for the upcoming episode.

If McCarthy and the SNL crew were trying to go incognito, they failed, choosing the street outside CNN's NYC headquarters to film the scene. Naturally, CNN employees grabbed their phones and started recording the action.

Don Lemon, who President Trump called the ""dumbest person in broadcasting"" in a TIME magazine interview this week, also got in on the fun.

After the first round of Spicey-spotting tweets went viral, users started adding their own soundtracks to the video clips.

9,UFC 211 fight scrapped after Jared Gordon ends up in the hospital ahead of weigh-ins | FOX Sports,"UFC 211 has lost yet another fight in the days leading up to the event.

Jared Gordon, who was making his promotional debut against Michel Quinones, announced on Friday morning that he was taken to the hospital after suffering through symptoms similar to food poisoning.

UFC officials confirmed that Gordon was off the card under advice from a physician and his bout with Michel Quinones has been scrapped.

According to Gordon, he was advised under the care of a doctor that he required an IV for fluids before he was ultimately pulled from the card taking place Saturday night in Dallas.

“Unfortunately I will not be fighting tomorrow,” Gordon wrote on his Facebook. “Everything was going smooth last night when I turned sick at about 8-9 pm. I was experiencing food poison symptoms. I was admitted to the hospital, along side UFC’s doctor. I was advised to use an IV, by both ER and UFC’s doctor which would make me ineligible to fight because of USADA’s rules . “I’m extremely sorry to everyone who were going to attend and or watch. Just another bump in the road.”

Gordon was just bumped up to the FX prelims for UFC 211 following an injury to Henry Cejudo earlier this week that canceled his fight with Sergio Pettis on the main card.

With Gordon vs. Quinones canceled, UFC 211 moves forward with 12 total bouts on the card.",fox-sports

“I’m going to stand by what I’ve been saying all year long on this show: I don’t trust Kevin Durant to blend into the late-game chemistry when they’re pressed late in games. So far, Portland was not able to push GS into a late-game, clutch-time situation. Obviously, Utah was not capable of pushing GS late in games. my spurs are capable of hanging in and hanging on to make four of these games close games. I won’t be surprised if Game 1 is a blowout because [the Warriors] are 10-point favorites, so maybe they’ll win by 25 and you’ll come in pumping your fists.

“I wasn’t sure how this team was going to be post-Tim Duncan. And this team grew on me all year long. I just like what it’s made of. I like the will and I like the skill. There’s some grit and guts to this team featuring Patty Mills and Manu Ginobli that I love. And I think it’s going to shine through against Golden state.

6,Trump threatens Comey in Twitter outburst,"Soon after tweeting the threat to Comey, Trump invoked former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who testified before the Senate earlier this week that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.

""When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?"" Trump tweeted.

When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Clapper, however, qualified his remarks by saying he had been unaware of an FBI investigation into the matter until Comey announced it to the public at a House hearing in March. And it's unclear how much Clapper would know about developments in the investigation after he left office earlier this year.

Clapper said on MSNBC Friday he was not intending to convict or clear anyone of collusion during his tenure.

""It would be in everyone's best interest to get to the bottom of this. And for the country,"" Clapper said. ""Otherwise, this is going to continue to linger as a dark cloud, in my opinion, over this administration.""

It's not unheard of for presidents to record conversations, using different systems to do so, with and without participants' knowledge. Six presidents secretly recorded meetings and telephone conversations between 1940 and 1973, according to historian and CNN contributor Julian Zelizer

John Dean, a former White House counsel under Nixon who served four months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal, said it would be Trump, not Comey, with the most to lose were recordings of the two men to surface.

""Obviously, President Trump is confused. He is the one who must hope there are no tapes. Honest people don't have problems being taped,"" Dean tweeted

JUST WATCHED Tapper: The real reasons Trump fired Comey Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tapper: The real reasons Trump fired Comey 03:23

Trump's reasoning behind firing Comey

The official White House version of how Comey came to be fired was that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

But mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russia probe.

Sources have told CNN that Trump's decision to ax Comey was made after he grew increasingly frustrated with him following a congressional hearing last week in which he said he was ""mildly nauseous"" over the idea that he helped sway the 2016 election. A source close to Comey told CNN's Jake Tapper Wednesday there are two specific reasons why Trump fired the FBI director:

1. Comey never provided the President with any assurance of personal loyalty.

2. The FBI's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia in the 2016 election was accelerating.

Trump's surrogates, including Vice President Mike Pence, have struggled to keep up with the shifting narrative on how and why the decision was made, and Trump tweeted Friday it was ""not possible"" for his team to recount details and talking points with ""perfect accuracy.""

On Thursday, Trump, discussing the firing of Comey, told NBC News that he was frustrated by the ongoing investigation and believed it was motivated by Democrats' fury at losing the election.

Trump told NBC's Lester Holt: ""And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.'""

Comey has not yet responded to the Senate intelligence committee's invitation to testify in closed session next week, Democratic and Republican spokespersons for the committee told CNN Friday.

Trump threatens press

Comey was not Trump's only target of an apparent threat Friday -- he also suggested the possibility of ending White House press briefings

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

WASHINGTON – An interim FBI director could be named as soon as Friday, Justice Department officials said.

Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said that acting director Andrew McCabe, who was appointed following Tuesday's abrupt firing of Director James Comey, would remain as deputy director if he was not chosen as the new interim chief.

In addition to McCabe, Flores said that Justice officials were reviewing four candidates, including three current FBI division chiefs. They are:

Adam Lee , chief of the FBI’s Richmond, Va., office. Prior to that, Lee oversaw the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section at FBI Headquarters in Washington. In that role, Lee led the bureau’s investigations of elected and appointed government officials and civil rights violations.

Justice officials have said that the interim appointee could also be considered as an official nominee to succeed Comey, who was dismissed just four years into his 10-year term.

Meanwhile, the White House earlier this week said Trump is considering ""several individuals"" to replace Comey.

While they wouldn't discuss potential candidates to replace James Comey permanently, attention was focused on at least seven candidates, which in addition to McCabe include: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Milwaukee County Sheriff Dave Clarke; South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy; former New York police commissioner Ray Kelly; former FBI agent and former Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Rogers, and John Pistole, a former deputy FBI director and Transportation Security Administration director.

6,Source: Comey is 'not worried about any tapes',"(CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey is ""not worried about any tapes"" of conversations between him and President Donald Trump, a source familiar with the matter told CNN Friday, adding that ""if there is a tape, there's nothing he is worried about"" that could be on it.

Friday morning, Trump issued a thinly veiled threat to Comey, apparently suggesting there are possibly recorded conversations between the two men that could be leaked to counter the former FBI director if necessary.

""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press,"" Trump tweeted.

On Friday, CNN's Jake Tapper reported that Comey was ""taken aback"" by Trump's request for a personal assurance or pledge of loyalty at a dinner shortly after he took office. Comey refused, saying he could not make such a pledge, but he promised to always be honest with the President.

The source said of the dinner between Comey and Trump on January 27 that it came at Trump's request and was one-on-one.

1,The 16 best gifts for college graduates of 2017,"The 16 best gifts for college graduates of 2017 (Photo: Reviewed.com)

— Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives.

Every May, college seniors prepare to say goodbye to school and hello to adulthood. Even if grads have something planned, their life for the first time is a blank slate. It can be exciting, sad, happy, scary, and bittersweet.

If you know someone graduating in the class of 2017, help them adjust to the real world with a gift they'll actually use. Of course, you can always give grads money, but one of these gifts would make a thoughtful addition to a check or a great replacement to a wad of cash all together. Whether you give a grad a book to help them with their finances, clothes to help them build their professional wardrobe, or a laptop to help them leave their used college devices behind, all will be appreciated.

Here are 16 gift ideas for the new college graduate in your life.

1. The Amazon Echo

(Photo: Amazon)

Recent grads are likely to become someone else’s assistant, so give them the gift of their own (digital) assistant. They can ask Alexa, the voice inside the device, anything from what the weather forecast is to how old Ariana Grande is. Bonus: it plays music when asked. But that’s not all the smart device does. Read our list of EVERYTHING that works with Echo and Alexa to see what else it’s capable of.

Buy now: Amazon Echo, $149.99 (On sale from $179.99), Amazon

2. A nice watch

(Photo: Nordstrom)

Watches for some reason symbolize adulthood. This might be because time isn’t really a thing until you graduate from college and life starts going by really quickly and you realize you need to make the most of every second. That’s why you should get your grad a watch, to remind them of this sad-but-true fact of life. Shinola watches are popular right now, but there are more affordable picks out there. For men, Nixon is a great, affordable alternative. And for women, Olivia Burton and Movado are two great options.

For men

For women

Buy now: Olivia Burton Midi Dial Leather Strap Watch, $110, Nordstrom

3. A new laptop

(Photo: Amazon)

After four years of school, a laptop has gone through a lot. With the amount of wear and tear put on a computer during college, it might be time for a new computer when you graduate. Help your grad out with a new laptop. This popular ASUS is half the price of a Macbook, and we recommend it.

4. Upgraded drinking glassware

(Photo: Nordstrom)

Once you graduate from college, you have to say goodbye to the red solo cup. Okay, I’m half kidding. I grew up with three brothers and my mom definitely bought the 250-pack of red solo cups regularly so she wouldn’t have to do dishes more often than 24-7. But when it comes to drinking alcohol in the real world, you need to class it up. The whiskey drinker would love this sophisticated, monogrammed decanter. It says ‘yes, I’m adult now, but I also still like to have fun,’ which is really just the motto for recent grads.

Buy now: Monogram Decanter from Cathy’s Concepts, $42, Nordstrom

5. Professional wardrobe

(Photo: Rent the Runway)

Depending on where you work, it’s likely you can’t wear yoga pants and sweatshirts in the office every day. Wardrobes certainly need upgrading when you go from being a college student to a working professional – and spicing up your closet can get pricey. Help your grad transition their wardrobe. You can always take them shopping or give them a gift card, but for the ladies, you could give them the gift of an unlimited designer wardrobe. Rent the Runway’s unlimited subscription lets you rent three designer pieces at a time with free shipping, dry cleaning, and insurance. You can cancel it any time. I have the subscription, and I love it.

6. Nice weekend bag

(Photo: Amazon, Nordstrom)

Whether your grad is moving back home or moving to a new place, they’re most likely going to be on-the-go. Whether it’s a weekend away to visit college friends, a work trip, or a night away from the ‘rents, an overnight bag is necessary. Of course you can splurge on fancy suitcases and leather luggage, but here are two great, affordable options for both men and women.

For women

7. Business card holder

Whether you have your own business cards or you’re collecting business cards from others (or both!), you need somewhere to store them. That’s where a business card holder comes in handy. There are lots of cheap options out there, but this cute Kate Spade holder is perfect for the trendy grad ready to take on the working world.

8. A coffee maker

(Photo: Amazon)

Coffee is essential to getting through the work day, but it can get pretty expensive going to Starbucks every day (believe me, you don’t want to know how much money I’ve spent at coffee shops in the last month never mind the last seven years since I graduated). If you want to get them more than just a Keurig, give your grad the gift of an espresso machine. With the Nespresso, they can pretend they’re still studying abroad while drinking the finest and strongest of coffee.

Buy now: Nespresso Inissia Espresso Maker, $81.58 (On sale from $149), Amazon

Bonus buy: Espresso pods, $37.53, Amazon

9. Camera (that’s not a smartphone)

(Photo: Amazon)

If your grad is looking for a “serious” camera to capture their new adult life, look no further than the Nikon D5500. This is the perfect gift for creative people who might feel trapped in their new cubicles. They can use the camera to upgrade their Instagram page or maybe even to start a career as a photographer. Who knows!

Buy now: Nikon D5500 with lens kit, $596.95 (On sale from $796.95), Amazon

10. A gym membership

(Photo: Getty Images/Jacob Ammentorp Lund)

Most college students can go to the gym for free. In other words, it’s included in tuition. But when you stop paying for college, there’s no longer a gym to go to or fitness classes to attend for free – and that stuff gets expensive. If you’re not sure what they want to do and where they want to do it, try getting your grad a ClassPass membership. With ClassPass, members can take up to 10 classes per month at different fitness studios in their area. Check the ClassPass website to see if it's available where your grad lives.

Buy now: ClassPass Membership, $40/month - $120/month, ClassPass

11. Nice headphones

(Photo: Amazon)

If your grad is moving to the city, give them the gift of tuning people out on the subway AKA a great pair of headphones. We love the Beats Powerbeats 3 here at Reviewed. Not only are these wireless headphones great for subway riders, they’re great for working out and listening to music at work.

Buy now: Powerbeats3 Wireless In-Ear Headphones, $149.99 ($50 off), Amazon

12. An Instant Pot

(Photo: Amazon)

Part of entering the real world is doing things on your own. One of those things: cooking meals instead of always relying on the dining hall or takeout. Instead of letting a recent grad buy a bunch of small kitchen appliances for their new home, give them a device that does it all. Meet: The Instant Pot. It’s a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, yogurt maker, and more. It honestly does everything. If there’s only room for one small appliance in a recent grad’s new kitchen, make it this one.

Buy now: Instant Pot, $89.95 (On sale from $99.95), Amazon

13. Books!

(Photo: Amazon)

Adjusting to life after college is hard. Your grad might feel lost, confused, and unprepared. Get them a book that will make them laugh, learn, and feel less alone as they try to figure the world out. Here are some great options. The first two happen to best-sellers on Amazon.

*Oh, The Sh!t You Don’t Know!: College Graduation Edition by Antonio Carter

Buy now: $13.49, Amazon

Buy now: $9.19, Amazon

*Broke Millennial: Stop Scraping By and Get Your Financial Life Together by Erin Lowry

Buy now: $10.40, Amazon

14. A nice wallet

(Photo: Nordstrom)

In the real world, you have credit cards, healthcare cards, loyalty cards, and the best one – money. A recent grad may not be used to having all of these things (especially money), so get them a place to store it all. For the guy who always carries around a wallet or should be, get him a nice one. This Ted Baker London wallet is a great option.

Buy now: Ted Baker London Splitz Leather Wallet, $95, Nordstrom

15. Jewelry

(Photo: Amazon)

When it comes to gifts for women, jewelry can be a cliché option. But when it marks a momentous event such as college graduation, it’s totally worth it. If you don’t want to splurge on fancy pearls or a diamond necklace, this popular Kate Spade initial necklace is a great pick. The initial gives it a personal touch and it goes with anything – work outfits and weekend outfits. Remember to pick the right initial character before you add to cart!

Buy now: Kate Spade New York ‘one in a million’ initial pendant necklace, $58, Amazon

16. Money

(Photo: Amazon)

What do adults want? Money. When do they want it? Always. Now that your grad is officially in the real world, they’re going to want money. If you don’t want to give them cash, get them a gift card. Amazon is a safe option because they have everything – including this adorable gift card box shaped as a graduation cap.

9,"Should the Capitals actually consider trading Alex Ovechkin? Well, it's complicated | FOX Sports","With the dust settling on the wreckage of yet another Washington Capitals season that ended too soon, there are fingers being pointed. That is to be expected.

And, not surprisingly, a lot of those fingers are being pointed at Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin.

This is hardly anything new. Ovechkin is one of the best pure goal scorers of his era – maybe ever – and has been the face of the Capitals since he entered the league as the top overall pick in 2004. But, at 31 years old, he has yet to lead the Caps past the second round of the playoffs.

This season may have held his best chance yet. The Capitals had a great team that finished with the best regular season record in the NHL for the second consecutive year. They were considered to be Cup favorites.

But then, also for the second consecutive year, the Caps were bounced in the second round by the Pittburgh Penguins.

It was a devastating fate for Washington, especially considering this was a beatable Pens team without Kris Letang for the entire series and Sidney Crosby for nearly two full games. The Capitals felt they were the better team – and, for much of the series, they were – but they simply didn’t get the job done.

Again.

Now, with another failure stacked on the pile, a familiar question is arising: Are the Capitals better off without Ovechkin?",fox-sports
9,"Former Ravens, Browns WR Michael Jackson killed in motorcycle accident | FOX Sports","Michael Jackson, who spent eight NFL seasons with the Browns and Ravens in the 1990s and led the league in touchdown catches during the Ravens’ first season in Baltimore, died early Friday morning in a motorcycle accident.

Louisiana police confirmed to TMZ Sports that Jackson, 48, was traveling at a high rate of speed on U.S. Highway 51 in Tangipahoa, La., when his motorcycle crashed into a car that was backing out into the highway. The impact was so strong that the bike reportedly smashed through the driver’s side door and killed both Jackson and the driver of the car.

Jackson was a sixth-round pick by the Browns in 1991 and had three 700-yard receiving years in his first five seasons before his breakout year when the team moved to Baltimore in 1996. He set career highs in receptions (76), yards (1,201) and TDs (14) in that season year as a Raven. He played two more years in Baltimore before injuries cut his career short at age 29.

6,This is the most WTF week in Washington in a long time,"(CNN) Remember that time when former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified in front of a Senate committee that she had warned White House counsel Don McGahn that national security adviser Michael Flynn was compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target?

That happened less than five days ago.

This week in politics has seemed more like a month as stories -- like the one involving Yates, Flynn and McGahn -- that would have been MASSIVE news in a normal week are forgotten amid the next MASSIVE story to break.

Walk down memory lane with me. And remember that all of these things have happened in the last 96 hours.

Tuesday, May 9

The day is dominated by talk of why Trump didn't fire Flynn for 18 days after Yates told McGahn about her concerns. Then, just before 6 p.m. ET, Trump fires FBI Director James Comey. Minutes later, CNN breaks the news that grand jury subpoenas have been delivered to associates of Flynn in connection with the ongoing FBI investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The White House communications shop goes into panic mode, with press secretary Sean Spicer's now-infamous among-the-bushes-in-the-dark briefing as the highlight/lowlight.

Wednesday, May 10

Vice President Mike Pence goes to Capitol Hill to argue that President Trump fired Comey because of a memo penned by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein arguing that Comey lost the confidence of the FBI with his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. (Trump would directly contradict that assertion less than 24 hours later.) Then, Trump does a photo-op with former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger even while comparisons of his firing of Comey to Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" swirl.

Later, pictures emerge of a smiling Trump shaking hands and laughing with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Yes, the same Kislyak at the center of the Flynn investigation. And the guy who Attorney General Jeff Sessions forgot he met with twice during the 2016 campaign, leading to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. The White House later admits it was tricked by the Russians, who used the photos to troll Trump

It makes me tired just writing it all.

The pace at which the news moves in the Trump presidency is, literally, unheard of -- the result of the fast-twitch social media culture, Trump's unpredictability, the level of interest (positive and negative) in everything and he does and, frankly, the long hours he keeps.

It's easy amid the barrage -- and every week has been a maelstrom if not the Category 5 level of this week -- to forget things that happened even a day or two ago.

Some of that is a concerted strategy on Trump's part. If you throw 100 balls into the air every day, no one can catch them all. He has, throughout his life, shown a penchant for using a new headline (of his own making) to bump down a less favorable headline. He thinks and acts like a cable TV producer and he knows that whatever is freshest is what usually dominates.

But there's more here too. The pace at which Trump moves and acts -- and tweets -- often feels manic, as though he is playing right on the edge between strategic and totally out of control.

The events of this week seem to be firmly in the out-of-control space. Trump and his White House seem to be careening from one political/public-relations disaster to another. There appears to be no consistent message, no consistent strategy and no real plan to get one.

The image that keeps coming to my mind is Trump, alone, angry and tweeting, while his staff runs around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to put out a fire -- even as two more start behind them.

Being unpredictable and unorthodox is one thing. Being totally out of control -- a car with no breaks, a roller coaster car running out of track -- is another. And Trump's White House finds itself jammed into that car -- with no clear sense of where they're headed -- right about now.",cnn
4,When Only Memories Can Fill The Cracks,"When I was a teenager, I drew the floor plan of my house a lot. It helped me tell stories about my family, where it was important to understand the view I had from my bedroom, or that there was a dividing half-wall between the kitchen and the living room in an otherwise open concept house. I’d draw lines to illustrate the trajectory of our tiny dog, who’d ricochet against the fridge, scramble down the hallway, bank off the doorframe into my parents’ bedroom, and steal a pair of socks. If I adjusted the scale of my drawing, I could show how close the house was to a nearby conservation area, and to the river beside where I’d sneak cigarettes and spray myself with CK One perfume before returning home, as though my mother wasn’t wise to the fact that the wooded areas of Guelph don’t smell like department store fragrance. My parents sold that house last fall, and moved into my mother’s childhood home — Nonna’s house, to me. Nonna is still alive, but her dementia means she’s been relocated to a retirement community, leaving her house empty. It wasn’t an easy process: My parents, looking to downsize, hadn’t found anything suitable after two years of looking. And Nonna, fiercely independent and living alone since the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier, wasn’t ready to let the house leave the family. She might not have ever moved were it not for the dementia, which, as a byproduct of its gradual erasure of Nonna’s memory, had made it dangerous for her to live alone. Once my parents bought the house, they began the physically necessary but emotionally taxing work of making it their own: a full reno, new appliances, new furniture. In addition to Nonna herself, most of the stuff that reminded me of her — the baby-blue shag carpet, the just-for-show purple towels in the upstairs bathroom, the Jesus portrait hanging above the staircase — is gone too. Nonna, for most of my life, would spend hours in conversation with me — in person at her house in Guelph, then over the phone once I moved to Toronto. Last time I saw her, she remembered me as her “granddaughter,” and that took 30 minutes. Nonna is physically recognizable to me, but the version of her who exists in my mind — the woman who anchored my family down — now lives only in the objects I connected to my formative memories of her: The kitchenwares, framed photographs, and textiles that were split among her living family members after my parents bought the house. They were once just home furnishings, but are now a direct line to a person in the midst of being erased. When I think of my parents’ new house, I draw the floor plan to Nonna’s house in my head. Then I fill it with all her physical belongings, the ones that still remind me of her, the ones I couldn’t save and that I’ll never see again. Even though Nonna is still alive, I include her.

When architects go on digs, the artifacts they uncover serve as irrefutable scientific evidence of the past. But they’re also objects that connect us to this past on a more visceral, sentimental level than carbon-dating. Physical artifacts can, to the trained eye, go well beyond confirming the existence of history — these objects tell us about habits, customs, fears, superstitions, victories celebrated and losses mourned; they tell us that people existed, and they tell us who those people were.

When my mother’s family moved to Canada from Northern Italy in 1959, they were stuff-less by necessity because there was no home ready for such things. The four of them — my mother, her older sister, and my Nonna and Nonno — first rented part of a house in a predominantly Italian neighbourhood in Guelph, later renting a whole house, all the while saving money for the plot of land they would eventually buy not far away by slowly buying only the stuff they needed: A matching pink couch, loveseat and chair, and a tufted, brocade couch for the basement; a television with knobs you’d twist to change the channels; a solid-wood kitchen table, so massive and imposing I always imagined they lowered it in with a crane before the house had a roof. After her husband died in 1984 — and, I think, even before — Nonna didn't replace things often, if ever, giving the impression that everything I ever knew Nonna to own was all she had ever owned.; Iin my mind she and her furniture, her pots and pans, her plates and cooking tools, are all inextricable from her. iThey were always in the same place (and, consequently, talways in the same place as her),and always in the same condition. Nonna and her things were constants, and while the stuff wasn't expensive or elaborate, but it was hers. She favoured olds sets of dishes for weeknight dinners of meaty pasta or perfect fried chicken cutlets with garlicky, parsley-studded mushrooms, and ancient tupperware for food storage. When things broke a little, she kept using them; when they broke a lot, she would fix them. There was a system to the way things were cared for: No plate or glass ever hit the kitchen table without a coaster or placemat beneath. Nonna cared about her home and possessions not because they were expensive, but because she bought them with her own money, and kept them in good shape. Her independence reflected in the purchase, the care, and the maintenance of a set of powder-pink living room furniture that may well have been brand new if not for their sort of awful late-60s hue. The way Nonna viewed her home and her things reflected how she viewed herself (and vice versa): With meticulous grooming, diligent upkeep, and the ability to either work around breaks as they happened, or fix them on her own. She cared for herself like a person who had the potential for permanence. There came a point when things began to degrade beyond her capacity for repair and upkeep. At first, this had to do mainly with Nonna’s physical limitations. It was difficult for her to descend the stairs to vacuum the basement, for example, so the rec room became permanently sealed off. Soon, my family was beginning to pitch in with laundry and small household chores. Without Nonna’s diligence, the house began to show its age. The plates, pans and utensils in her cupboards collected dust as they fell into disuse — she’d still cook sometimes, sure, but she didn’t have the energy for family dinners anymore. And sometimes, the recipes tasted just a bit off, like she’d forgotten a step, or confused the measurements for a couple of ingredients. She became anxious, distracted, and confused. But despite the physical evidence collecting around her — the house and everything in it, spotless and new for decades, was suddenly old and worn — Nonna denied there was anything wrong. Four years ago, she left a pot of water on the stove so long it was blackened beyond the point of cleaning or repair. She had completely forgotten it was there. In any other context, the incident might have been innocuous, but for Nonna — who had already been slowly losing grip on her stuff, her home, her independence — it was a tipping point. lLiving alone was no longer safe. My family began discussions about moving her to a retirement home, which involved discussions about what would come of her house, and of course, all her things. Near the end of Nonna’s time at the house, that kitchen table — around which we’d gather every Christmas, and at least on Sunday a month — began to crack right down the middle. The springs on the basement couch had become so worn, you’d almost hit the floor if you sat on it. And and who wanted a television that forced you to walk up to it just to change the channel? As anyone who’s divided an estate will tell you, the conversation around a loved one's possessions revolves largely around one question: What do you want? Some things were readily spoken for — the only two pots that remained of the set shipped over from Italy went to my mother and aunt. An espresso set, long coveted by one of my cousins, was set aside for him. The basement furniture, all of it worn by time or by the misuse of my sister and I, was donated or trashed. Last Easter, my sister and I sat down in my aunt’s basement to divide the possessions that had been set aside for us — mostly things from the kitchen. What was initially a conversation of utility, of looking at objects and determining, as I always do when deciding what I should own, whether they’re of actual use to me, became an exercise in remembering Nonna through her possessions. Things became impossible to discard. When presented with the physical manifestation of every Sunday dinner I’d ever eaten, invisibly imprinted with the memory of the woman who cooked them as I watched over her shoulder. I couldn’t imagine living without any of it. I took broken Tupperware that might have once carried leftover lasagna from Nonna’s house to ours, and a full set of cutlery despite already owning more than enough forks. I took a giant gilded soup tureen that I had never even seen before, because I knew it was part of a set that had been carefully carried over on a boat, in 1959, and an awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot whose only use, as far as I can tell, is boiling water. I wrapped it all up in a set of rags—threadbare after years of use dusting the framed photos of Nonno, which, along with some wedding gifts and pieces of jewellery, were the only sentimental things I knew Nonna to own—that are now vacuum sealed and packed away, to preserve Nonna’s crisp hemmed edges, never again to be used for their intended purpose. In Nonna’s things, I can still see her the way I remember her best: Proudly self-sufficient and independent. And if I keep her things clean, in good working order and in good repair, I feel like I can keep that Nonna — the one she herself fought to maintain, the one she tried for so long to deny we were all losing, the one who, in reality, disappeared many years ago — alive forever.

The last time I talked to Nonna on the phone, it was on her 87th birthday. She told me that she was very old now, that she hadn’t really felt up to doing anything that day. She asked if I was happy with my job and my apartment. Then she thanked me for calling and said goodbye. No “I love you.” Until four or five years ago, Nonna would repeat her “I love yous” at the end of a phone call until I had no choice but to hang up on her. I don’t doubt that she still loves me; it’s more likely that these days, after a few minutes, she doesn’t remember who called.

When I was younger, I took for granted what an indomitable force Nonna was. She lived alone and kept a home by herself for three decades, while acting as an emergency contact for my entire family, no matter what we needed: A ride, a loan, a night off. She could be difficult and demanding, but we were close. I was patient with her when she struggled with English, and, later, eager to learn from her when she cooked. When she still lived at home but had begun to experience waking nightmares, I spent a night there, and she felt safe enough to sleep through the night. In my adult life, I have used Nonna’s immovable spirit of independence as a guiding principle. Now, her loss of independence is devastating because it means I have lost the part of her of which I was most in awe, but also, because I am terrified of someday losing my own. The same things that happened to Nonna will probably happen to me, with or without dementia. I might not be able to wash the plates I took from her kitchen to mine, because they’re too heavy. My eyesight might prevent me from patching up small holes in t-shirts and dish cloths, and my back — which is already in bad shape, frankly — could make it hard for me to vacuum my carpets. I might forget how to cook the things I most love to eat. I will get old, and I will fight back against age as it claws back against my ability to do things for myself. And I, like Nonna, might refuse to negotiate and to accept that I simply can’t do things the way I used to. Frankly, I probably will: I’ve adopted a lot of Nonna’s obstinate self-sufficiency. I wonder if I’ll forget her awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot on the stove someday, and I wonder who will decide what happens to all of the things I’ve inherited from Nonna after I’ve forgotten that most of them ever existed in the first place. When I first saw how my parents had changed Nonna’s house, was like one of those dreams where you know you’re at your old high school but everything looks like your best friend’s kitchen. The cognitive disconnect was overwhelming. On an early visit, I ran my hand along one of the hallway walls, wondering if I’d be able to physically register that it now ends sooner than it used to. I’d close my eyes while sitting on the new, grey couch and pretend I was still sitting on the old, pink one; a feat of imagination assisted by a living room window that’s still the same width and height that it used to be. Though, with horizontal blinds replacing the old vertical ones — and slightly less light coming in — it feels like everything has gotten a bit colder, and a bit smaller. The truth is actually kind of the opposite: Nonna’s furniture took up so much more space than the stuff my parents own. Especially the table. And somehow, they lifted the massive wood one that hosted all the Christmas dinners, coffees, and conversations we never had anywhere else, and moved it out of the house. Nobody saved it. The crack down its middle had deepened into a chasm; the solid foundation that had once supported our family gatherings was being gradually replaced by a widening, empty gulf, unyielding as it was irreparable.",buzzfeed
9,Is this bicycle kick howler the greatest/worst own goal ever? | FOX Sports,"It’s not often that Swiss soccer highlights make their rounds on the internet, but when something amazing happens and there’s video of it, eventually it’ll make it to the masses.

Such is the case for Pully Football’s Adrien Gulfo, who hit a worldy against FC Renens in the Coupe de Vaudoise semifinal earlier this month. The Pully defender popped up the ball high in the air, timed his leap perfectly to make contact with a bicycle kick that settled delicately into the far corner of the net.

There was just one problem for Gulfo. He hit it into his own net.

So, it’s not ideal. But remove the own-goal aspect from it for just a second and imagine he’s a striker. That angle is unreal. Sure, the keeper might have been on his toes and been more poised to stop the attempt, but what a hit. The good news for Gulfo and Pully is that the world’s most stylish own goal didn’t come back to haunt them.

The match wound up finishing 3-3, and Pully pulled out a 4-3 win in the penalty shootout. They’ll take on Malley in the final on May 25.

6,"Sean Spicer isn't saying whether President Trump tapes his phone calls. Wait, what?","Washington (CNN) Six hours after President Donald Trump implied that he could be taping phone calls with now-deposed FBI Director James Comey , White House press secretary Sean Spicer refused to rule that possibility out.

Stop. Go back and read that first sentence again. Ok. Moving on.

""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer repeated again and again as he was blitzed with questions about the ""tape"" tweet . ""The tweet speaks for itself.""

Deep breath.

So, here's what we know: The president of the United States made a not-so-subtle threat against the FBI director he fired to stay quiet because he might just have recorded the phone calls between the two of them. The White House press secretary, when given a chance to say definitively that no such recording happened, took a pass.

Now ask yourself this: If Trump wasn't recording phone calls, why wouldn't Spicer jump at the opportunity to clarify that as soon as humanly possible? After all, secretly recording phone calls in the White House has been off limits since Richard Nixon did so -- to great personal damage -- during his presidency.

Why, in a week in which Trump is already being compared to Nixon for his firing of Comey, would the White House not immediately swat the story down if it wasn't true?

There are two possible answers to that question as far as I can tell:

Trump refuses to acknowledge he got way over his skis in that tweet Friday morning Trump is recording his phone calls.

I genuinely don't know which one is more likely at this point.

My natural tendency would be to assume that of course Trump isn't recording phone calls because that would be incredibly cavalier and dangerous. But, this is Donald Trump we're talking about. He built a reputation and a career on saying and doing things no one else would even consider saying or doing. And it got him elected president. So, why would he feel constrained once he was sitting in the Oval Office?

On the other hand, Trump is famous (infamous?) for never saying sorry or even looking backward. His stubbornness has caused him and his staff untold agita in his first 112 days in office. One example: Trump's tweet that he was being wiretapped by President Obama during the 2016 campaign has been debunked by everyone in a position to know. And yet Trump stands by it -- trying desperately to find a way out that doesn't involve him admitting he made it up. (His latest tactic is to elide his allegation of wiretapping with the broader surveillance being conducted by the National Security Agency.)

Which is it then? I genuinely have no idea.

But no matter the reasons for Trump's sort-of insinuation and Spicer's refusal to knock down the idea, we now have real cause to wonder whether this president of the United States has a secret phone recording system up and running.

What a thing to contemplate.",cnn

16,Massive ransomware attack hits 74 countries,"Tens of thousands of ransomware attacks are targeting organizations around the world on Friday.

Security firm Kaspersky Lab has recorded more than 45,000 attacks in 74 countries in the past 10 hours. Most of the attacks have targeted Russia.

What is it?

The ransomware, called ""WannaCry,"" locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them. Researchers say it is spreading through a Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) Windows exploit called ""EternalBlue,"" which Microsoft released a patch for in March. A hacking group leaked the exploit in a trove of other NSA spy tools last month.

""Affected machines have six hours to pay up and every few hours the ransom goes up,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, the principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. ""Most folks that have paid up appear to have paid the initial $300 in the first few hours.""

Sixteen National Health Service (NHS) organizations in the UK have been hit, and some of those hospitals have canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible. Spanish telecom company Telefónica was also hit with the ransomware.

Spanish authorities confirmed the ransomware is spreading through the EternalBlue vulnerability and advised people to patch.

""It is going to spread far and wide within the internal systems of organizations -- this is turning into the biggest cybersecurity incident I've ever seen,"" UK-based security architect Kevin Beaumont said.

Related: NSA's powerful Windows hacking tools leaked online

Kaspersky Lab says although the WannaCry ransomware can infect computers even without the vulnerability, EternalBlue is ""the most significant factor"" in the global outbreak.

How to prevent it

Beaumont examined a sample of the ransomware used to target NHS and confirmed it was the same used to target Telefónica. He said companies can apply the patch released in March to all systems to prevent WannaCry infections. Although it won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

He said it's likely the ransomware will spread to U.S. firms too. The ransomware is automatically scanning for computers it can infect whenever it loads itself onto a new machine. It can infect other computers on the same wireless network.

""It has a 'hunter' module, which seeks out PCs on internal networks,"" Beaumont said. ""So, for example, if your laptop is infected and you went to a coffee shop, it would spread to PCs at the coffee shop. From there, to other companies.""

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, Friday's attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion. When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.",cnn
16,Delta flubs electronics ban,"Even airlines are confused by the electronics ban on flights to America.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) briefly posted a sign in its Cincinnati terminal Friday warning international travelers that they would have to check any electronics, other than a cell phone, when flying back to the United States: ""Effective May 12 passengers will only be permitted to carry a cell phone onboard flights returning to the United States. All other personal electronics devices will be required to be checked.""

But although the Trump administration is considering whether to ban laptops and other large devices from cabins on flights from Europe to the United States, no such ban is in effect yet. U.S. and European officials have been discussing an expansion this week, but for now, the ban still only applies to flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and Africa. That rule went into effect in March.

Delta has direct flights from Cincinnati to three foreign airports -- Paris, Toronto and Cancun. Mexico and Canada are not part of the ban discussions as of now. A Delta spokesman apologized for the confusion that the sign caused and said it's been removed. It only appeared in Cincinnati, but it lives on social media.

It was another indication of the difficulty that the Department of Homeland Security has had as it rolls new travel policies.

That original electronics ban was first disclosed in a tweet from Royal Jordanian Airlines, rather than in an official statement from the U.S. government.

3,Costa Concordia captain's sentence upheld by Italy court,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Francesco Schettino was sentenced in 2015

Italy's highest court has upheld the 16-year jail sentence given to the captain of the Costa Concordia, which capsized in 2012 killing 32 people.

Francesco Schettino had handed himself in to the Rebibbia prison in Rome after the verdict, his lawyer said.

Schettino was sentenced in 2015 after a court found him guilty of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident and abandoning ship.

The cruise ship capsized after hitting rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio.

Schettino was nicknamed ""Captain Coward"" by the media, after the coastguard released recordings of him in a lifeboat resisting orders to return to the stricken vessel.

More than 4,000 people were aboard at the time and were forced into a chaotic evacuation.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the Costa Concordia capsized

Prosecutors say he steered too close to the island to show off to a dancer, Domnica Cemortan, who was with him at the helm.

But he blamed communication problems with the Indonesian helmsman.

The court ruling was welcomed by a lawyer representing relatives of the victims, who said it represented justice at last.

The sentence included 10 years for manslaughter, five for causing the shipwreck, one for abandoning the ship before passengers and crew were clear, and one month for lying to the authorities afterwards.

Costa Crociere, the company that owned the ship, sidestepped potential criminal charges in 2013 by agreeing to pay a €1m ($1.1m; £769,000) fine.

Five of Schettino's colleagues were also jailed for up to three years in earlier cases.",bbc-news
10,HTC U 11 teaser points to serious audio skills,"While a pressure-sensitive frame is likely to be the highlight of the HTC U11 it’s seemingly not the only trick the phone will have up its sleeve, as a new teaser suggests you’ll be able to record sound in 360 degrees.

Posted on HTC’s official Twitter account, the teaser is a short, silent video of dirt bikes circling a person, and what appears to be a visual representation of sound waves coming from all directions.

Perhaps more telling than the content though, is the caption, which reads “360 real-life recording.”

It’s all still a bit vague, but recording presumably means either audio or video, and since the HTC U 11 is rumored to have fairly ordinary single-lens cameras on the front and back it’s unlikely that it will be able to shoot 360-degree videos.

360 real-life recording. 05.16.17 #BrilliantU pic.twitter.com/2lpipWCcZN11 May 2017

Immersive audio

Audio though is another matter altogether. HTC’s phones are often known for standout sound and there have already been rumors that the HTC U 11 will have 4 microphones, with the ability to record audio in 3D, for a surround sound effect, so we’d say this teaser is almost a confirmation of that.

Last year's HTC 10 had a similar power, and did certainly shoot brilliant 4K videos (among the best we'd seen on a phone in terms of a video and audio combo) but this could be a bigger step forward.

It might sound like a niche feature, but it has the potential to make videos far more immersive, particularly when recording scenes where sound is key, such as a concert – or, as in the teaser’s example, being circled by dirt bikes.

We’ll know for sure whether this is what HTC is teasing soon, as the HTC U 11 is being revealed on May 16.",techradar

10,"Google IO 2017: dates, schedule and rumors for Google's big developer conference","Update: Google rolled out new features for its Allo chat app in early May, namely incognito mode for groups, chat backup/restore and link preview. None of these are huge new additions, but it's a sign Google is actively updating Allo, and we'll likely hear much more about it at IO.

Google has also released its official IO 2017 app with new features such as early seat reservations. It's a handy tool for IO attendees, but the app also lets those who can't make it livestream the keynote and sessions on their phone or tablet.

Original article below...

Google IO, the search giant's annual developer conference, is almost here. Actually, let's try that again: Google is referring to this year's IO as an ""outdoor developer festival"", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and so much more.

The Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif.

The official Google IO 2017 schedule is also out now, letting attendees and those watching from home get a taste of what Google has cooking.

We're still digesting everything Google announced at IO 2016, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat , the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.

This year's event looks to be just as jam-packed, so if you're a developer interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop on over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited in order to register). Attending IO is no cheap trip: A general admission Google IO 2017 ticket costs $1,150 (about £930, AU$1,535).

While this ""festival"" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.

Google IO 2017 schedule

Google has announced a ton of talks for the Google IO 2017 schedule , and here's some great news if you're unable to attend in person: Every technical session, all 150+ of them, will be livestreamed.

The theme of this year's conference seems to be ""more,"" with even more sessions still to be announced, more space for developers, more Office Hours and more ways to connect with everything Google announces.

Google is also doing something different this year and hosting an hour-long Developer Keynote at 1pm PT on May 17, shortly after the main keynote wraps up. This will give developers a chance to gain deeper insight into how they can utilize everything Google just announced.

A few sessions to highlight from the current schedule are:

What's New in Android : 2pm - 3pm PT May 17. In what will likely be the most well-attended and widely watched session of IO, this session will go over what's new for developers when it comes to Android. This includes the Android O Developer Preview SDK, Support Libraries and what Google says will be ""other new and exciting developments."" Expect plenty of details on what Android O has to offer both developers and users.

Android Wear: What's new & Best Practices : 9:30am - 10:30am PT on May 18. This session will ""introduce new features of the next release of Android Wear,"" as well as go over the work that's already been done in Android Wear and best practices for making apps for the wearable operating system.

What's new for Android TV : 10:30am - 11:30am PT on May 18. Here, developers will learn all the latest on the Android TV front, including new APIs, features and future platform improvements.

Introduction to Android Instant Apps : 1:30pm - 2:30pm PT on May 18. In what will likely be a key theme of the show, this session will go over Instant Apps for developers, including how to build their own. While this may be too technical for regular users, it's a sign Google will devote plenty of time - and probably officially roll out - Instant Apps at the show. Here's more on why this is a good thing for users .

Google promises more talks are on the way, so we'll keep this page updated with anything that sounds interesting between now and May 17. To get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!

Say hello to Android O

The star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O come May.

While we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another public submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.

What will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case with Android O.

But what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.

One of the most exciting features of the early build is 'Background limits'. This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.

Android O also currently houses picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.

One final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth to your devices.

As Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, also look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.

What's the word on Android Wear 2?

Android Wear 2 launched in February, so while it's unlikely Google will announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.

For starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.

We wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2 apps are announced, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.

With Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.

Google Home invasion

Google introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write ""Google"" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features made available to the original.

One of the more robust rumors is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.

Considering Google already has the Project Fi and Google Voice services, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which puts the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.

Another report, this time from early April , says Google is considering an updated Home smart speaker that doubles as a mesh Wi-Fi router.

The device would act as a personal assistant and internet router in one, and presumably like Google Wifi would need multiple units to create a mesh network.

A few points against updated hardware or major new features are that Google Home added one of its most requested features, multiple user support , in mid-April and the device just went on sale in the UK. Still, if Google is working to improve Google Home, chances are we'll see whatever is in store at IO.

Google Chrome improvement

Another area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and this could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.

The most likely developments we'll hear about are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.

There are also whispers spreading Google is preparing an ad-blocker built into Chrome. It's almost impossible ad revenue-dependent Google would block every ad on Chrome, so it's more likely Google will introduce a tool that filters out the most offending ads. Perhaps we'll meet this quasi-ad blocker at IO.

New Google Pixel phones? Perhaps

Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL are in the works.

It's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.

Not only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, and if a recent Google investment in LG Display is anything to go by, the new Pixel phones will have curved OLED screens.

Virtual reality, Chromecast and everything else

There's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we might see:

Like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2 headset, but we'll undoubtedly have news on the VR front from the Big G. These could include a headset price reduction, or updates related to how developers create and publish content for virtual reality.

With Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , as Google recently told us, we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.

On the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 . This would certainly make sense, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the IO cards.

Another possible topic are updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.

We could also be in for a new Chromecast as it's been some months since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale. At one time the best selling streaming video device, Google may look to recapture some of that old Chromecast magic with a new and improved device.

Google is also interested in getting Assistant into more devices. The search giant released a developer preview Google Assistant SDK in late April, letting anyone build the digital helper into any device they create. While many of these gadgets will be of the prototype variety, expect some commercial products to hit the market with Assistant in tow. We'll likely hear plenty more about this initiative during IO.

The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.

Google recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.

This is not to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January. And with video app Google Duo adding voice-only calling on April 10, the chat app waters have gotten even muddier.

(Image: © Google)

What is clear is that there are one too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps the Big G will finally drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.

This was in an effort to ""focus and prioritize"" on the features and apps Google deems most important, and could be just the start of a chat service spring cleaning we'll see the culmination of at IO.

Another likely announcement is the Allo desktop and/or web app, both of which have been teased by Google execs. Users are especially keen to get Allo on the desktop, and it's a good bet Google won't want to disappoint.",techradar
6,"As Trump implies there are 'tapes' of talks with Comey, Sean Spicer refuses to answer","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As we continue to follow the developments of FBI Director James Comey’s firing, President Donald Trump continues to add fuel to the fire. Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60

White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to confirm or deny whether President Trump tapes his phone calls or conversations with others – including inside the Oval Office.

The startling non-denial at the White House press briefing came just hours after Trump, in what appeared to be a threat to his fired FBI director Friday morning, implied there may be recordings of his conversations with James Comey. ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Spicer dodged multiple questions from reporters about whether Trump makes a habit of recording conversations or whether there were recording devices in the room during the meeting with Comey.

""He simply stated the fact. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said. ""There's nothing further to add on that.""

Trump's early morning tweet that set off this firestorm was a clear indication of his defensiveness as the fallout continues from this week's abrupt and controversial firing of Comey, the man who was overseeing an ongoing FBI investigation into whether Trump's campaign associates colluded with Russians seeking to influence the American presidential election.

Yet Trump's tweet this morning was not actually meant as a warning to Comey not to speak to the media, Spicer said. ""That’s not a threat. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As the Trump administration continues to stand by the decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer says the administration continues to fight the 'false narrative' of Trump administration ties with Russia. (May 12) AP

At issue here are the differing accounts of the discussions Trump had with Comey over the FBI's Russia investigation.

In his short termination letter to Comey on Tuesday, Trump made a specific point of mentioning that he ""appreciated"" how the FBI told him three times he was not personally under investigation in the counterintelligence probe. He later elaborated, in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, that those conversations took place twice in phone calls and once at a private dinner with the FBI director.

FBI officials have questioned Trump's claims, and the agency's acting director, Andrew McCabe, on Thursday said such assurances about the scope of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation would not be ""standard practice.''

Also, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, cast serious doubt on Trump's claim that Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

Clapper said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.'' In an interview on MSNBC on Friday, Clapper said: ""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI.""

Trump, on the other hand, told NBC a day earlier that Comey had requested the dinner to ask to keep his job after the election. FBI directors, by law, serve 10 year terms; Comey had six more years left.

Since the other assurances Trump mentioned apparently took place by phone, some analysts wondered if Trump's reference to ""tapes"" referred to wiretapping.

In a letter sent to the White House, House Democrats – John Conyers of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland – called for the release of any tapes and recorded communications between Trump and Comey.

""Under normal circumstances, we would not consider credible any claims that the White House may have taped conversations of meetings with the president,"" they wrote. ""However, because of the many false statements made by White House officials this week, we are compelled to ask whether any such recordings do in fact exist. If so, we request copies of all recordings in possession of the White House regarding this matter.""

Wikileaks also offered $100,000 to anyone who would leak tapes of Trump and Comey's communications.

Some analysts say Trump might not be the only one to be keeping track of conversations. Comey, they said, might have his own written records of his discussions with Trump.

Historian Michael Beschloss tweeted: ""Have to presume that Comey kept some kind of record of any conversation he had with the President.""

And Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice during the Obama administration, tweeted: ""One thing I learned at DOJ about Comey: he leaves a protective paper trail whenever he deems something inappropriate happened. Stay tuned.""

Giving more details about the discussions at Friday's briefing, Spicer said Trump was seeking assurances from the FBI director that he wasn't under investigation because he wanted to fight back against ""the narrative"" building around the Russia story.​

Disputing the basis of the Russia investigation, Spicer said, ""There's no collusion that occurred."" In fact, Trump wants investigators to get to the bottom of Russian involvement in the election, Spicer said, so as to debunk the ""false narrative"" that the Trump campaign was somehow involved.

In the Friday briefing, Spicer also denied reports that Trump solicited a loyalty pledge from Comey during their dinner earlier this year.

A New York Times report – one that may have inspired one of Friday's tweets — said Trump asked the FBI director to pledge personal loyalty to him during their dinner. ""Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge,"" the Times reported. ""Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not 'reliable' in the conventional political sense.""

Spicer's briefing began with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster discussing the president's upcoming trip to the Middle East and Europe, despite threats from President Trump earlier in the day threatening to cancel press briefings because he was unhappy with the media coverage of Comey's dismissal.

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

In a striking reversal one day earlier, Trump told NBC News that he planned to fire Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance. ""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"" who led the agency into turmoil.

He also specifically brought up the ongoing Russia investigation. ""In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself – I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC. ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""

These reasons contradicted the White House's assertions — and even the widely disseminated termination letter Trump sent Comey — that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who criticized Comey's handling of the email investigation into Hillary Clinton last year.

Spicer called the coverage of changing stories behind Comey's dismissal miss the point.

""It's always the president's decision,"" Spicer said.

He did not dispute Trump's suggestion that press briefings should be canceled, saying only, ""I think he's a little dismayed"" by the media coverage.

Trump reiterated the idea of canceling briefings in a separate interview with Fox's Jeanine Pirro. Calling them ""press conferences,"" he characterized the briefings as having ""a level of hostility that’s incredible and it’s very unfair.""

The White House Correspondents Association objected to Trump's threat. Shutting down news briefings, the association said in a statement, ""would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned.""

As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday. (Photo: MariuszBlach, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

LONDON — As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday.

The infections have disabled more than a dozen hospitals in the United Kingdom, Spain's largest telecom company and universities in Italy as well as some FedEx computers. The payment was demanded per computer, to be paid in Bitcoin, an untraceable digital currency.

Infected computers showed a screen giving the user three days to pay the ransom. After that, the price would be doubled. After seven days the files would be deleted, it threatened.

The ransomware code is named WanaCrypt and has been in use by criminals since at least February. It is available in at least 28 languages, including Bulgarian and Vietnamese, according to Avast, a Czech security company that is following the fast-moving attack.

However, a new variant dubbed WannaCry was created that makes use of a vulnerability in the Windows operating system that was patched by Microsoft on March 14. Computers that have not installed the patch are potentially vulnerable to the malicious code, according to a Kaspersky Lab blog post on Friday.

The ransomware is believed to be linked to an exploit, computer code that takes advantage of a computer vulnerability, known to have been used by the Equation Group, which many in the security world believe is connected to the National Security Agency (NSA).

That exploit was one of many hacking tools stolen from the NSA and later published online by a group that called itself the Shadow Brokers, according to Avast.

That group has been leaking pieces of more than a gigabyte worth of older NSA software weapons since August.

Avast has recorded over 50,000 attacks globally as of Friday afternoon. The majority are targeted at Russia, the Ukraine and Taiwan but have also hit multiple other countries.

Services in London, the central city of Nottingham, and the counties of Hertfordshire and Cumbria were affected, according to the BBC. The National Health Service (NHS) said 16 of its organizations reported they were victims.

The hackers behind the ""ransomware"" attack were demanding $300 worth of the online currency Bitcoin to release files from encryption, the Mirror and Telegraph reported.

In a statement, the NHS said: ""A number of NHS organizations have reported to NHS Digital that they have been affected by a ransomware attack which is affecting a number of different organizations. The investigation is at an early stage but we believe the malware variant is Wanna Decryptor.""

""At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected organizations to confirm this.""

The NHS said the attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and was affecting other organizations. It said it was working to resolve the problem.

Hackers behind the Wanna Decryptor virus, a type of malware, often ask users for money to retrieve access to files they have encrypted.

NHS Merseyside, which operates a number of hospitals in northwestern England, tweeted, “we are taking all precautionary measures possible to protect our local NHS systems and services.” The NHS Merseyside website was down Friday afternoon local time.

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which runs four hospitals north of London, said in a statement: ""Immediately on discovery of the problem, the trust acted to protect its IT systems by shutting them down; it also meant that the trust’s telephone system is not able to accept incoming calls.”

It said it was postponing all non-urgent work and asked people not to come to the accident and emergency unit.

Doctors at some surgeries were forced to use pen and paper to record patient details following the attack, local media reported.

John Caldwell, a doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian he had “no access to record systems or results.""

Chris Mimnagh, another doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian: “Unable to access our clinical system – as a precaution our area has severed links to the wider NHS, which means no access to our national systems, no computers means no records, no prescriptions, no results. We are dealing with urgent problems only. Our patients are being very understanding so far.”

NHS Million, a campaign which supports NHS staff and is separate from the NHS, tweeted: ""We just don't understand the mentality of some people. The only people suffering are people that need emergency care. #nhscyberattack""

WASHINGTON – The nation's former top intelligence official Friday cast serious doubt on President Trump's claim that now-fired FBI Director James Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.''

""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI,'' Clapper said in an interview on MSNBC.

Clapper, a highly-regarded figure during his long service in government, is the latest in a growing number of former and current government officials who have rushed to defend Comey, abruptly dismissed Tuesday. For his own part, Clapper also renounced Trump's assertions that he had had offered an independent finding earlier this week that there was no collusion between Trump associates and the Russian government.

Trump's explosive claim about Comey came in a Thursday interview with NBC News when he said the director had requested the dinner to express his desire to continue his tenure at the FBI. That would have been an unusual request, since he was in the fourth year of a 10-year term.

But Clapper flatly dismissed Trump's account. According to Comey, the dinner invitation had been extended by Trump, Clapper said. He also said that Trump's claim that Comey sought the meeting to keep his job was completely out of character for the former director.

""I can't imagine him doing that,'' Clapper said in the interview.

In an early Friday flurry of tweets, Trump appeared to threaten Comey from offering a version of the dinner that contradicted the president's, raising the prospect that their meeting had been secretly recorded.

""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations,'' the president said in a tweet.

Yet one person close to Comey, who was not authorized to comment publicly, flatly dismissed the president's version as not accurate.

Clapper also rejected Trump's assertion that Comey's ouster was necessary because of long-standing ""turmoil'' within the bureau. The former intelligence chief said he regularly interacted with other FBI officials who offered no such assessments.

""From my vantage point, the morale at the FBI was very high,'' Clapper said.

Earlier this week, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told a Senate panel that Comey maintained ""broad support'' within the bureau.

Clapper's unflinching support of Comey came as Trump, in a separate Friday tweet, referred to the former national intelligence director's testimony to a Senate panel earlier this week. Trump said Clapper had publicly insisted there was no collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

However, that's not the full story. Clapper told lawmakers that the intelligence community’s report on Russian hacking, which he oversaw, did not include any evidence of collusion. But Clapper also added that he was unaware of the ongoing FBI investigation until Comey disclosed it publicly in March.

""I don't know if there was collusion or not,'' Clapper said Friday in the MSNBC interview.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer appeared to dismiss the implications of Clapper's stated lack of knowledge about the ongoing inquiry and his inability to provide a definitive assessment of Russian collusion. ""It sounds like the story has changed,"" Spicer said.

1,David Boren realignment rhetoric should keep Big 12 on edge,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The college football season doesn't start until the fall but it's never too early to start looking ahead. USA TODAY Sports

With David Boren (left), on the dais with commissioner Bob Bowlsby, the Big 12 put expansion to rest last fall. But Boren can't resist being restless. (Photo: LM Otero, AP)

He is a lifelong politician, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Oklahoma president David Boren can’t keep his mouth shut when it comes to realignment (even after an attempt to muzzle him was made 15 months ago) and can’t help himself from subtly suggesting — again — that the Sooners’ future may not be in the Big 12 (even as he says he’s all-in with the league).

Boren has become the master of conference realignment doublespeak, never passing up an opportunity to put Oklahoma into wild speculation involving the SEC, Pac 12 or Big Ten.

Here were some of Boren’s choice comments to reporters following a Board of Regents meeting on Thursday, as reported by The Oklahoman.

► “I think it’s very important for us to always have the possibility of making a move if we want to, but I assure you that we don’t have any plans to make a move. That’s just my responsibility to the institution not to get us into a position where we can’t make our own choice when the time comes. … It’s in our interest that the Big 12 succeed. So no, we’re not desperate to go anywhere else.”

(If the goal here is to have conference realignment speculation dominate the summer again while saying nothing of substance, good job!)

MORE COLLEGE SPORTS:

► “I’ve been thinking three or four or five years down the road if there’s any need to make a change, but I haven’t wanted us to extend our grant of rights by 20 years or something like that so that OU would have no choices.”

(At least Boren admits the obvious here. Texas and Oklahoma could ensure the Big 12’s long-term future with one stroke of a pen. Alas, the Big 12’s current grant of rights expires in 2025 and won’t be extended because Texas and Oklahoma don’t want to extend it. So unless there’s a new media deal and grant of rights for the Big 12 in 2022 or so, Texas and Oklahoma will essentially become free agents. If they want to be. Which may or may not happen.)

►“I wouldn’t write the Big 12 off yet. It’s had its struggles and obviously our losing the opportunity or letting the opportunity pass us by to have had a network when, back at the time, the networks would’ve been anxious to have us.”

(If you’re an administrator at, say, Baylor or Texas Tech, it can’t be too reassuring when the Oklahoma president is in “Don’t write us off!” mode while also taking a backhanded swipe at the conference’s inability to get in on the television network madness due to the existence of the Longhorn Network. Good times.)

And then this, from the Tulsa World, which also noted that Boren praised the “stature in the academic community” of the Pac-12 and Big Ten:

► “We wouldn’t walk away from the Big 12 lightly, I’ll put it that way. We don’t have any plans to leave right now. There’s not any active conversation going on.”

(Right now?!! Nobody in the media is going to seize on that qualifier, I’m sure. Whoops, too late.)

Look, it’s no secret Boren lost the battle with Texas that was waged last year when he went public with his desire to expand to 12 teams, re-institute a football championship game and start a Big 12 network, which would have essentially required the Longhorns to give up their own channel (and, given the current cable environment, might not have been feasible anyway). The Big 12 gave Boren one out of three, and yet Oklahoma is still hanging around. For now. And up until the day the Big 12 breaks apart or Boren retires — whichever comes first — he’s going to periodically remind his colleagues that Oklahoma controls its own destiny in the conference realignment discussion.

Whether you consider that a warning or empty rhetoric from the former governor and U.S. senator might depend on the day. Or, to be specific, where a Big 12 team falls in the College Football Playoff rankings in a particular week.

As of right now, the reality for Oklahoma is no different than it was last year or when the realignment landscape started to change: It is in a far weaker league today than it was in May 2010. But it’s not so weak that Texas and Oklahoma can’t save it.

Just as it always was, the handwringing over how many draft picks or Playoff teams the Big 12 produces comes down to Texas being Texas and Oklahoma being Oklahoma. Anything short of that, as we’ve seen the past few years with the Longhorns flailing around the middle of the pack, and it gets dicey for a 10-team league that doesn’t have a great depth of traditionally strong programs.

If Texas football gets its act together under Tom Herman, the Big 12 will suddenly look like a much better neighborhood for Oklahoma. Still, the sudden spate of conversation about Oklahoma’s conference future has to be troubling for the rest of the league after it supposedly put the issue of adding members to bed last fall. Even if it’s based on nothing more than innuendo and a politician’s ego, Boren has kept the story going and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.

3,"In-cabin ban on laptops, tablets on flights from Europe to U.S. appears inevitable","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The United States and the United Kingdom are setting new carry-on restrictions for certain flights that ban laptops and other large electronic devices. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60

A U.S. ban on laptops and tablets in cabins of trans-Atlantic flights to the United States appeared all but inevitable Friday after Department of Homeland Security officials briefed European governments on a proposal that would affect millions of passengers.

The move, which would impact routes that carry as many as 65 million people a year on over 400 daily flights, would expand a ban already in place for planes flying out of eight Middle East and African countries.

The restriction was introduced in March over fears that bombs or explosive materials could be concealed on electronic devices brought onboard. Cellphones would still be allowed in cabins but virtually every other electronic device would not be permitted and would need to be stowed in checked bags.

One issue that has become a focus for security officials is how to make sure that lithium batteries used in laptops aren't turned into bombs that can be detonated mid-air even if stored in luggage holds.

The United Kingdom has a similar ban in place for some in-bound flights, although its list of targeted countries differs from that of the United States.

Officials from France, Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy took part in the conference call Friday with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

A French official who was briefed about the talks said the Americans announced they wanted to extend the current ban, and the Europeans planned to formulate a response in coming days, according to the Associated Press. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan, said the primary questions revolved around when and how — not whether — the ban would be imposed.

Jenny Burke, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said no final decision has been made on expanding the restriction. But Homeland Security officials met Thursday with high-ranking executives of the three leading U.S. airlines — American, Delta and United — and the industry’s leading U.S. trade group, Airlines for America, to discuss expanding the laptop policy to flights arriving from Europe.

Two airline officials briefed on the discussions said DHS gave no timetable for an announcement, but they were resigned to its inevitability. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the meeting publicly.

U.S. airlines say they still hope to have a say in how the policy is put into effect at airports to minimize inconvenience to passengers.

The current ban, which affects about 50 flights per day from 10 cities, does not prevent passengers from checking laptops and other electronic devices into luggage holds.

Still, the move could lead to fewer bookings and would complicate passengers' travel plans. The U.S. is a major destination for Europe-originated flights, with more than 10 million travelers flying there each year from destinations across the continent.

Caroline Bremner, head of travel at research firm Euromonitor International, said that before President Trump took office the U.S. was expected to see 85.2 million airline passenger arrivals by 2020. Under the new administration, arrivals to the U.S. are forecast to drop slightly to 84.2 million for the period.

6,"Sean Spicer isn't saying whether President Trump tapes his phone calls. Wait, what?","Washington (CNN) Six hours after President Donald Trump implied that he could be taping phone calls with now-deposed FBI Director James Comey , White House press secretary Sean Spicer refused to rule that possibility out.

Stop. Go back and read that first sentence again. Ok. Moving on.

""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer repeated again and again as he was blitzed with questions about the ""tape"" tweet . ""The tweet speaks for itself.""

Deep breath.

So, here's what we know: The president of the United States made a not-so-subtle threat against the FBI director he fired to stay quiet because he might just have recorded the phone calls between the two of them. The White House press secretary, when given a chance to say definitively that no such recording happened, took a pass.

Now ask yourself this: If Trump wasn't recording phone calls, why wouldn't Spicer jump at the opportunity to clarify that as soon as humanly possible? After all, secretly recording phone calls in the White House has been off limits since Richard Nixon did so -- to great personal damage -- during his presidency.

Why, in a week in which Trump is already being compared to Nixon for his firing of Comey, would the White House not immediately swat the story down if it wasn't true?

There are two possible answers to that question as far as I can tell:

Trump refuses to acknowledge he got way over his skis in that tweet Friday morning Trump is recording his phone calls.

I genuinely don't know which one is more likely at this point.

My natural tendency would be to assume that of course Trump isn't recording phone calls because that would be incredibly cavalier and dangerous. But, this is Donald Trump we're talking about. He built a reputation and a career on saying and doing things no one else would even consider saying or doing. And it got him elected president. So, why would he feel constrained once he was sitting in the Oval Office?

On the other hand, Trump is famous (infamous?) for never saying sorry or even looking backward. His stubbornness has caused him and his staff untold agita in his first 112 days in office. One example: Trump's tweet that he was being wiretapped by President Obama during the 2016 campaign has been debunked by everyone in a position to know. And yet Trump stands by it -- trying desperately to find a way out that doesn't involve him admitting he made it up. (His latest tactic is to elide his allegation of wiretapping with the broader surveillance being conducted by the National Security Agency.)

Which is it then? I genuinely have no idea.

But no matter the reasons for Trump's sort-of insinuation and Spicer's refusal to knock down the idea, we now have real cause to wonder whether this president of the United States has a secret phone recording system up and running.

16,Massive ransomware attack hits 74 countries,"Tens of thousands of ransomware attacks are targeting organizations around the world on Friday.

Security firm Kaspersky Lab has recorded more than 45,000 attacks in 74 countries in the past 10 hours. Most of the attacks have targeted Russia.

What is it?

The ransomware, called ""WannaCry,"" locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them. Researchers say it is spreading through a Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) Windows exploit called ""EternalBlue,"" which Microsoft released a patch for in March. A hacking group leaked the exploit in a trove of other NSA spy tools last month.

""Affected machines have six hours to pay up and every few hours the ransom goes up,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, the principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. ""Most folks that have paid up appear to have paid the initial $300 in the first few hours.""

Sixteen National Health Service (NHS) organizations in the UK have been hit, and some of those hospitals have canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible. Spanish telecom company Telefónica was also hit with the ransomware.

Spanish authorities confirmed the ransomware is spreading through the EternalBlue vulnerability and advised people to patch.

""It is going to spread far and wide within the internal systems of organizations -- this is turning into the biggest cybersecurity incident I've ever seen,"" UK-based security architect Kevin Beaumont said.

Kaspersky Lab says although the WannaCry ransomware can infect computers even without the vulnerability, EternalBlue is ""the most significant factor"" in the global outbreak.

How to prevent it

Beaumont examined a sample of the ransomware used to target NHS and confirmed it was the same used to target Telefónica. He said companies can apply the patch released in March to all systems to prevent WannaCry infections. Although it won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

He said it's likely the ransomware will spread to U.S. firms too. The ransomware is automatically scanning for computers it can infect whenever it loads itself onto a new machine. It can infect other computers on the same wireless network.

""It has a 'hunter' module, which seeks out PCs on internal networks,"" Beaumont said. ""So, for example, if your laptop is infected and you went to a coffee shop, it would spread to PCs at the coffee shop. From there, to other companies.""

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, Friday's attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion. When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.",cnn
16,Delta flubs electronics ban,"Even airlines are confused by the electronics ban on flights to America.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) briefly posted a sign in its Cincinnati terminal Friday warning international travelers that they would have to check any electronics, other than a cell phone, when flying back to the United States: ""Effective May 12 passengers will only be permitted to carry a cell phone onboard flights returning to the United States. All other personal electronics devices will be required to be checked.""

But although the Trump administration is considering whether to ban laptops and other large devices from cabins on flights from Europe to the United States, no such ban is in effect yet. U.S. and European officials have been discussing an expansion this week, but for now, the ban still only applies to flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and Africa. That rule went into effect in March.

Delta has direct flights from Cincinnati to three foreign airports -- Paris, Toronto and Cancun. Mexico and Canada are not part of the ban discussions as of now. A Delta spokesman apologized for the confusion that the sign caused and said it's been removed. It only appeared in Cincinnati, but it lives on social media.

3,Costa Concordia captain's sentence upheld by Italy court,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Francesco Schettino was sentenced in 2015

Italy's highest court has upheld the 16-year jail sentence given to the captain of the Costa Concordia, which capsized in 2012 killing 32 people.

Francesco Schettino had handed himself in to the Rebibbia prison in Rome after the verdict, his lawyer said.

Schettino was sentenced in 2015 after a court found him guilty of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident and abandoning ship.

The cruise ship capsized after hitting rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio.

Schettino was nicknamed ""Captain Coward"" by the media, after the coastguard released recordings of him in a lifeboat resisting orders to return to the stricken vessel.

More than 4,000 people were aboard at the time and were forced into a chaotic evacuation.

Prosecutors say he steered too close to the island to show off to a dancer, Domnica Cemortan, who was with him at the helm.

But he blamed communication problems with the Indonesian helmsman.

The court ruling was welcomed by a lawyer representing relatives of the victims, who said it represented justice at last.

The sentence included 10 years for manslaughter, five for causing the shipwreck, one for abandoning the ship before passengers and crew were clear, and one month for lying to the authorities afterwards.

Costa Crociere, the company that owned the ship, sidestepped potential criminal charges in 2013 by agreeing to pay a €1m ($1.1m; £769,000) fine.

Five of Schettino's colleagues were also jailed for up to three years in earlier cases.",bbc-news
10,HTC U 11 teaser points to serious audio skills,"While a pressure-sensitive frame is likely to be the highlight of the HTC U11 it’s seemingly not the only trick the phone will have up its sleeve, as a new teaser suggests you’ll be able to record sound in 360 degrees.

Posted on HTC’s official Twitter account, the teaser is a short, silent video of dirt bikes circling a person, and what appears to be a visual representation of sound waves coming from all directions.

Perhaps more telling than the content though, is the caption, which reads “360 real-life recording.”

It’s all still a bit vague, but recording presumably means either audio or video, and since the HTC U 11 is rumored to have fairly ordinary single-lens cameras on the front and back it’s unlikely that it will be able to shoot 360-degree videos.

360 real-life recording. 05.16.17 #BrilliantU pic.twitter.com/2lpipWCcZN11 May 2017

Immersive audio

Audio though is another matter altogether. HTC’s phones are often known for standout sound and there have already been rumors that the HTC U 11 will have 4 microphones, with the ability to record audio in 3D, for a surround sound effect, so we’d say this teaser is almost a confirmation of that.

Last year's HTC 10 had a similar power, and did certainly shoot brilliant 4K videos (among the best we'd seen on a phone in terms of a video and audio combo) but this could be a bigger step forward.

It might sound like a niche feature, but it has the potential to make videos far more immersive, particularly when recording scenes where sound is key, such as a concert – or, as in the teaser’s example, being circled by dirt bikes.

We’ll know for sure whether this is what HTC is teasing soon, as the HTC U 11 is being revealed on May 16.",techradar

10,"Google IO 2017: dates, schedule and rumors for Google's big developer conference","Update: Google rolled out new features for its Allo chat app in early May, namely incognito mode for groups, chat backup/restore and link preview. None of these are huge new additions, but it's a sign Google is actively updating Allo, and we'll likely hear much more about it at IO.

Google has also released its official IO 2017 app with new features such as early seat reservations. It's a handy tool for IO attendees, but the app also lets those who can't make it livestream the keynote and sessions on their phone or tablet.

Original article below...

Google IO, the search giant's annual developer conference, is almost here. Actually, let's try that again: Google is referring to this year's IO as an ""outdoor developer festival"", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and so much more.

The Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif.

The official Google IO 2017 schedule is also out now, letting attendees and those watching from home get a taste of what Google has cooking.

We're still digesting everything Google announced at IO 2016, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat , the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.

This year's event looks to be just as jam-packed, so if you're a developer interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop on over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited in order to register). Attending IO is no cheap trip: A general admission Google IO 2017 ticket costs $1,150 (about £930, AU$1,535).

While this ""festival"" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.

Google IO 2017 schedule

Google has announced a ton of talks for the Google IO 2017 schedule , and here's some great news if you're unable to attend in person: Every technical session, all 150+ of them, will be livestreamed.

The theme of this year's conference seems to be ""more,"" with even more sessions still to be announced, more space for developers, more Office Hours and more ways to connect with everything Google announces.

Google is also doing something different this year and hosting an hour-long Developer Keynote at 1pm PT on May 17, shortly after the main keynote wraps up. This will give developers a chance to gain deeper insight into how they can utilize everything Google just announced.

A few sessions to highlight from the current schedule are:

What's New in Android : 2pm - 3pm PT May 17. In what will likely be the most well-attended and widely watched session of IO, this session will go over what's new for developers when it comes to Android. This includes the Android O Developer Preview SDK, Support Libraries and what Google says will be ""other new and exciting developments."" Expect plenty of details on what Android O has to offer both developers and users.

Android Wear: What's new & Best Practices : 9:30am - 10:30am PT on May 18. This session will ""introduce new features of the next release of Android Wear,"" as well as go over the work that's already been done in Android Wear and best practices for making apps for the wearable operating system.

What's new for Android TV : 10:30am - 11:30am PT on May 18. Here, developers will learn all the latest on the Android TV front, including new APIs, features and future platform improvements.

Introduction to Android Instant Apps : 1:30pm - 2:30pm PT on May 18. In what will likely be a key theme of the show, this session will go over Instant Apps for developers, including how to build their own. While this may be too technical for regular users, it's a sign Google will devote plenty of time - and probably officially roll out - Instant Apps at the show. Here's more on why this is a good thing for users .

Google promises more talks are on the way, so we'll keep this page updated with anything that sounds interesting between now and May 17. To get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!

Say hello to Android O

The star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O come May.

While we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another public submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.

What will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case with Android O.

But what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.

One of the most exciting features of the early build is 'Background limits'. This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.

Android O also currently houses picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.

One final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth to your devices.

As Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, also look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.

What's the word on Android Wear 2?

Android Wear 2 launched in February, so while it's unlikely Google will announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.

For starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.

We wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2 apps are announced, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.

With Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.

Google Home invasion

Google introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write ""Google"" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features made available to the original.

One of the more robust rumors is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.

Considering Google already has the Project Fi and Google Voice services, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which puts the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.

Another report, this time from early April , says Google is considering an updated Home smart speaker that doubles as a mesh Wi-Fi router.

The device would act as a personal assistant and internet router in one, and presumably like Google Wifi would need multiple units to create a mesh network.

A few points against updated hardware or major new features are that Google Home added one of its most requested features, multiple user support , in mid-April and the device just went on sale in the UK. Still, if Google is working to improve Google Home, chances are we'll see whatever is in store at IO.

Google Chrome improvement

Another area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and this could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.

The most likely developments we'll hear about are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.

There are also whispers spreading Google is preparing an ad-blocker built into Chrome. It's almost impossible ad revenue-dependent Google would block every ad on Chrome, so it's more likely Google will introduce a tool that filters out the most offending ads. Perhaps we'll meet this quasi-ad blocker at IO.

New Google Pixel phones? Perhaps

Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL are in the works.

It's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.

Not only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, and if a recent Google investment in LG Display is anything to go by, the new Pixel phones will have curved OLED screens.

Virtual reality, Chromecast and everything else

There's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we might see:

Like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2 headset, but we'll undoubtedly have news on the VR front from the Big G. These could include a headset price reduction, or updates related to how developers create and publish content for virtual reality.

With Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , as Google recently told us, we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.

On the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 . This would certainly make sense, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the IO cards.

Another possible topic are updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.

We could also be in for a new Chromecast as it's been some months since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale. At one time the best selling streaming video device, Google may look to recapture some of that old Chromecast magic with a new and improved device.

Google is also interested in getting Assistant into more devices. The search giant released a developer preview Google Assistant SDK in late April, letting anyone build the digital helper into any device they create. While many of these gadgets will be of the prototype variety, expect some commercial products to hit the market with Assistant in tow. We'll likely hear plenty more about this initiative during IO.

The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.

Google recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.

This is not to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January. And with video app Google Duo adding voice-only calling on April 10, the chat app waters have gotten even muddier.

(Image: © Google)

What is clear is that there are one too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps the Big G will finally drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.

This was in an effort to ""focus and prioritize"" on the features and apps Google deems most important, and could be just the start of a chat service spring cleaning we'll see the culmination of at IO.

Another likely announcement is the Allo desktop and/or web app, both of which have been teased by Google execs. Users are especially keen to get Allo on the desktop, and it's a good bet Google won't want to disappoint.",techradar
6,"As Trump implies there are 'tapes' of talks with Comey, Sean Spicer refuses to answer","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As we continue to follow the developments of FBI Director James Comey’s firing, President Donald Trump continues to add fuel to the fire. Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60

White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to confirm or deny whether President Trump tapes his phone calls or conversations with others – including inside the Oval Office.

The startling non-denial at the White House press briefing came just hours after Trump, in what appeared to be a threat to his fired FBI director Friday morning, implied there may be recordings of his conversations with James Comey. ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Spicer dodged multiple questions from reporters about whether Trump makes a habit of recording conversations or whether there were recording devices in the room during the meeting with Comey.

""He simply stated the fact. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said. ""There's nothing further to add on that.""

Trump's early morning tweet that set off this firestorm was a clear indication of his defensiveness as the fallout continues from this week's abrupt and controversial firing of Comey, the man who was overseeing an ongoing FBI investigation into whether Trump's campaign associates colluded with Russians seeking to influence the American presidential election.

Yet Trump's tweet this morning was not actually meant as a warning to Comey not to speak to the media, Spicer said. ""That’s not a threat. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As the Trump administration continues to stand by the decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer says the administration continues to fight the 'false narrative' of Trump administration ties with Russia. (May 12) AP

At issue here are the differing accounts of the discussions Trump had with Comey over the FBI's Russia investigation.

In his short termination letter to Comey on Tuesday, Trump made a specific point of mentioning that he ""appreciated"" how the FBI told him three times he was not personally under investigation in the counterintelligence probe. He later elaborated, in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, that those conversations took place twice in phone calls and once at a private dinner with the FBI director.

FBI officials have questioned Trump's claims, and the agency's acting director, Andrew McCabe, on Thursday said such assurances about the scope of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation would not be ""standard practice.''

Also, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, cast serious doubt on Trump's claim that Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

Clapper said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.'' In an interview on MSNBC on Friday, Clapper said: ""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI.""

Trump, on the other hand, told NBC a day earlier that Comey had requested the dinner to ask to keep his job after the election. FBI directors, by law, serve 10 year terms; Comey had six more years left.

Since the other assurances Trump mentioned apparently took place by phone, some analysts wondered if Trump's reference to ""tapes"" referred to wiretapping.

In a letter sent to the White House, House Democrats – John Conyers of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland – called for the release of any tapes and recorded communications between Trump and Comey.

""Under normal circumstances, we would not consider credible any claims that the White House may have taped conversations of meetings with the president,"" they wrote. ""However, because of the many false statements made by White House officials this week, we are compelled to ask whether any such recordings do in fact exist. If so, we request copies of all recordings in possession of the White House regarding this matter.""

Wikileaks also offered $100,000 to anyone who would leak tapes of Trump and Comey's communications.

Some analysts say Trump might not be the only one to be keeping track of conversations. Comey, they said, might have his own written records of his discussions with Trump.

Historian Michael Beschloss tweeted: ""Have to presume that Comey kept some kind of record of any conversation he had with the President.""

And Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice during the Obama administration, tweeted: ""One thing I learned at DOJ about Comey: he leaves a protective paper trail whenever he deems something inappropriate happened. Stay tuned.""

Giving more details about the discussions at Friday's briefing, Spicer said Trump was seeking assurances from the FBI director that he wasn't under investigation because he wanted to fight back against ""the narrative"" building around the Russia story.​

Disputing the basis of the Russia investigation, Spicer said, ""There's no collusion that occurred."" In fact, Trump wants investigators to get to the bottom of Russian involvement in the election, Spicer said, so as to debunk the ""false narrative"" that the Trump campaign was somehow involved.

In the Friday briefing, Spicer also denied reports that Trump solicited a loyalty pledge from Comey during their dinner earlier this year.

A New York Times report – one that may have inspired one of Friday's tweets — said Trump asked the FBI director to pledge personal loyalty to him during their dinner. ""Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge,"" the Times reported. ""Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not 'reliable' in the conventional political sense.""

Spicer's briefing began with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster discussing the president's upcoming trip to the Middle East and Europe, despite threats from President Trump earlier in the day threatening to cancel press briefings because he was unhappy with the media coverage of Comey's dismissal.

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

In a striking reversal one day earlier, Trump told NBC News that he planned to fire Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance. ""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"" who led the agency into turmoil.

He also specifically brought up the ongoing Russia investigation. ""In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself – I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC. ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""

These reasons contradicted the White House's assertions — and even the widely disseminated termination letter Trump sent Comey — that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who criticized Comey's handling of the email investigation into Hillary Clinton last year.

Spicer called the coverage of changing stories behind Comey's dismissal miss the point.

""It's always the president's decision,"" Spicer said.

He did not dispute Trump's suggestion that press briefings should be canceled, saying only, ""I think he's a little dismayed"" by the media coverage.

Trump reiterated the idea of canceling briefings in a separate interview with Fox's Jeanine Pirro. Calling them ""press conferences,"" he characterized the briefings as having ""a level of hostility that’s incredible and it’s very unfair.""

The White House Correspondents Association objected to Trump's threat. Shutting down news briefings, the association said in a statement, ""would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned.""

3,"Massive, fast-moving cyberattack hits as many as 74 countries","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Hackers launched a massive cyber attack. They hit 74 countries. Veuer's Nick Cardona (@nickcardona93) has that story. Buzz60

As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday. (Photo: MariuszBlach, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

LONDON — As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday.

The infections have disabled more than a dozen hospitals in the United Kingdom, Spain's largest telecom company and universities in Italy as well as some FedEx computers. The payment was demanded per computer, to be paid in Bitcoin, an untraceable digital currency.

Infected computers showed a screen giving the user three days to pay the ransom. After that, the price would be doubled. After seven days the files would be deleted, it threatened.

The ransomware code is named WanaCrypt and has been in use by criminals since at least February. It is available in at least 28 languages, including Bulgarian and Vietnamese, according to Avast, a Czech security company that is following the fast-moving attack.

However, a new variant dubbed WannaCry was created that makes use of a vulnerability in the Windows operating system that was patched by Microsoft on March 14. Computers that have not installed the patch are potentially vulnerable to the malicious code, according to a Kaspersky Lab blog post on Friday.

The ransomware is believed to be linked to an exploit, computer code that takes advantage of a computer vulnerability, known to have been used by the Equation Group, which many in the security world believe is connected to the National Security Agency (NSA).

That exploit was one of many hacking tools stolen from the NSA and later published online by a group that called itself the Shadow Brokers, according to Avast.

That group has been leaking pieces of more than a gigabyte worth of older NSA software weapons since August.

Avast has recorded over 50,000 attacks globally as of Friday afternoon. The majority are targeted at Russia, the Ukraine and Taiwan but have also hit multiple other countries. Russia’s Interior Ministry said Friday it had come under cyberattack.

Services in London, the central city of Nottingham, and the counties of Hertfordshire and Cumbria were affected, according to the BBC. The National Health Service (NHS) said 16 of its organizations reported they were victims.

The hackers behind the ""ransomware"" attack were demanding $300 worth of the online currency Bitcoin to release files from encryption, the Mirror and Telegraph reported.

In a statement, the NHS said: ""A number of NHS organizations have reported to NHS Digital that they have been affected by a ransomware attack which is affecting a number of different organizations. The investigation is at an early stage but we believe the malware variant is Wanna Decryptor.""

""At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected organizations to confirm this.""

The NHS said the attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and was affecting other organizations. It said it was working to resolve the problem.

Hackers behind the Wanna Decryptor virus, a type of malware, often ask users for money to retrieve access to files they have encrypted.

NHS Merseyside, which operates a number of hospitals in northwestern England, tweeted, “we are taking all precautionary measures possible to protect our local NHS systems and services.” The NHS Merseyside website was down Friday afternoon local time.

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which runs four hospitals north of London, said in a statement: ""Immediately on discovery of the problem, the trust acted to protect its IT systems by shutting them down; it also meant that the trust’s telephone system is not able to accept incoming calls.”

It said it was postponing all non-urgent work and asked people not to come to the accident and emergency unit.

Doctors at some surgeries were forced to use pen and paper to record patient details following the attack, local media reported.

John Caldwell, a doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian he had “no access to record systems or results.""

Chris Mimnagh, another doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian: “Unable to access our clinical system – as a precaution our area has severed links to the wider NHS, which means no access to our national systems, no computers means no records, no prescriptions, no results. We are dealing with urgent problems only. Our patients are being very understanding so far.”

NHS Million, a campaign which supports NHS staff and is separate from the NHS, tweeted: ""We just don't understand the mentality of some people. The only people suffering are people that need emergency care. #nhscyberattack""

WASHINGTON – The nation's former top intelligence official Friday cast serious doubt on President Trump's claim that now-fired FBI Director James Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.''

""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI,'' Clapper said in an interview on MSNBC.

Clapper, a highly-regarded figure during his long service in government, is the latest in a growing number of former and current government officials who have rushed to defend Comey, abruptly dismissed Tuesday. For his own part, Clapper also renounced Trump's assertions that he had had offered an independent finding earlier this week that there was no collusion between Trump associates and the Russian government.

Trump's explosive claim about Comey came in a Thursday interview with NBC News when he said the director had requested the dinner to express his desire to continue his tenure at the FBI. That would have been an unusual request, since he was in the fourth year of a 10-year term.

But Clapper flatly dismissed Trump's account. According to Comey, the dinner invitation had been extended by Trump, Clapper said. He also said that Trump's claim that Comey sought the meeting to keep his job was completely out of character for the former director.

""I can't imagine him doing that,'' Clapper said in the interview.

In an early Friday flurry of tweets, Trump appeared to threaten Comey from offering a version of the dinner that contradicted the president's, raising the prospect that their meeting had been secretly recorded.

""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations,'' the president said in a tweet.

Yet one person close to Comey, who was not authorized to comment publicly, flatly dismissed the president's version as not accurate.

Clapper also rejected Trump's assertion that Comey's ouster was necessary because of long-standing ""turmoil'' within the bureau. The former intelligence chief said he regularly interacted with other FBI officials who offered no such assessments.

""From my vantage point, the morale at the FBI was very high,'' Clapper said.

Earlier this week, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told a Senate panel that Comey maintained ""broad support'' within the bureau.

Clapper's unflinching support of Comey came as Trump, in a separate Friday tweet, referred to the former national intelligence director's testimony to a Senate panel earlier this week. Trump said Clapper had publicly insisted there was no collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

However, that's not the full story. Clapper told lawmakers that the intelligence community’s report on Russian hacking, which he oversaw, did not include any evidence of collusion. But Clapper also added that he was unaware of the ongoing FBI investigation until Comey disclosed it publicly in March.

""I don't know if there was collusion or not,'' Clapper said Friday in the MSNBC interview.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer appeared to dismiss the implications of Clapper's stated lack of knowledge about the ongoing inquiry and his inability to provide a definitive assessment of Russian collusion. ""It sounds like the story has changed,"" Spicer said.

1,David Boren realignment rhetoric should keep Big 12 on edge,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The college football season doesn't start until the fall but it's never too early to start looking ahead. USA TODAY Sports

He is a lifelong politician, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Oklahoma president David Boren can’t keep his mouth shut when it comes to realignment (even after an attempt to muzzle him was made 15 months ago) and can’t help himself from subtly suggesting — again — that the Sooners’ future may not be in the Big 12 (even as he says he’s all-in with the league).

Boren has become the master of conference realignment doublespeak, never passing up an opportunity to put Oklahoma into wild speculation involving the SEC, Pac 12 or Big Ten.

Here were some of Boren’s choice comments to reporters following a Board of Regents meeting on Thursday, as reported by The Oklahoman.

► “I think it’s very important for us to always have the possibility of making a move if we want to, but I assure you that we don’t have any plans to make a move. That’s just my responsibility to the institution not to get us into a position where we can’t make our own choice when the time comes. … It’s in our interest that the Big 12 succeed. So no, we’re not desperate to go anywhere else.”

(If the goal here is to have conference realignment speculation dominate the summer again while saying nothing of substance, good job!)

MORE COLLEGE SPORTS:

► “I’ve been thinking three or four or five years down the road if there’s any need to make a change, but I haven’t wanted us to extend our grant of rights by 20 years or something like that so that OU would have no choices.”

(At least Boren admits the obvious here. Texas and Oklahoma could ensure the Big 12’s long-term future with one stroke of a pen. Alas, the Big 12’s current grant of rights expires in 2025 and won’t be extended because Texas and Oklahoma don’t want to extend it. So unless there’s a new media deal and grant of rights for the Big 12 in 2022 or so, Texas and Oklahoma will essentially become free agents. If they want to be. Which may or may not happen.)

►“I wouldn’t write the Big 12 off yet. It’s had its struggles and obviously our losing the opportunity or letting the opportunity pass us by to have had a network when, back at the time, the networks would’ve been anxious to have us.”

(If you’re an administrator at, say, Baylor or Texas Tech, it can’t be too reassuring when the Oklahoma president is in “Don’t write us off!” mode while also taking a backhanded swipe at the conference’s inability to get in on the television network madness due to the existence of the Longhorn Network. Good times.)

And then this, from the Tulsa World, which also noted that Boren praised the “stature in the academic community” of the Pac-12 and Big Ten:

► “We wouldn’t walk away from the Big 12 lightly, I’ll put it that way. We don’t have any plans to leave right now. There’s not any active conversation going on.”

(Right now?!! Nobody in the media is going to seize on that qualifier, I’m sure. Whoops, too late.)

Look, it’s no secret Boren lost the battle with Texas that was waged last year when he went public with his desire to expand to 12 teams, re-institute a football championship game and start a Big 12 network, which would have essentially required the Longhorns to give up their own channel (and, given the current cable environment, might not have been feasible anyway). The Big 12 gave Boren one out of three, and yet Oklahoma is still hanging around. For now. And up until the day the Big 12 breaks apart or Boren retires — whichever comes first — he’s going to periodically remind his colleagues that Oklahoma controls its own destiny in the conference realignment discussion.

Whether you consider that a warning or empty rhetoric from the former governor and U.S. senator might depend on the day. Or, to be specific, where a Big 12 team falls in the College Football Playoff rankings in a particular week.

As of right now, the reality for Oklahoma is no different than it was last year or when the realignment landscape started to change: It is in a far weaker league today than it was in May 2010. But it’s not so weak that Texas and Oklahoma can’t save it.

Just as it always was, the handwringing over how many draft picks or Playoff teams the Big 12 produces comes down to Texas being Texas and Oklahoma being Oklahoma. Anything short of that, as we’ve seen the past few years with the Longhorns flailing around the middle of the pack, and it gets dicey for a 10-team league that doesn’t have a great depth of traditionally strong programs.

If Texas football gets its act together under Tom Herman, the Big 12 will suddenly look like a much better neighborhood for Oklahoma. Still, the sudden spate of conversation about Oklahoma’s conference future has to be troubling for the rest of the league after it supposedly put the issue of adding members to bed last fall. Even if it’s based on nothing more than innuendo and a politician’s ego, Boren has kept the story going and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.

3,"In-cabin ban on laptops, tablets on flights from Europe to U.S. appears inevitable","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The United States and the United Kingdom are setting new carry-on restrictions for certain flights that ban laptops and other large electronic devices. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60

A U.S. ban on laptops and tablets in cabins of trans-Atlantic flights to the United States appeared all but inevitable Friday after Department of Homeland Security officials briefed European governments on a proposal that would affect millions of passengers.

The move, which would impact routes that carry as many as 65 million people a year on over 400 daily flights, would expand a ban already in place for planes flying out of eight Middle East and African countries.

The restriction was introduced in March over fears that bombs or explosive materials could be concealed on electronic devices brought onboard. Cellphones would still be allowed in cabins but virtually every other electronic device would not be permitted and would need to be stowed in checked bags.

One issue that has become a focus for security officials is how to make sure that lithium batteries used in laptops aren't turned into bombs that can be detonated mid-air even if stored in luggage holds.

The United Kingdom has a similar ban in place for some in-bound flights, although its list of targeted countries differs from that of the United States.

Officials from France, Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy took part in the conference call Friday with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

A French official who was briefed about the talks said the Americans announced they wanted to extend the current ban, and the Europeans planned to formulate a response in coming days, according to the Associated Press. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan, said the primary questions revolved around when and how — not whether — the ban would be imposed.

Jenny Burke, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said no final decision has been made on expanding the restriction. But Homeland Security officials met Thursday with high-ranking executives of the three leading U.S. airlines — American, Delta and United — and the industry’s leading U.S. trade group, Airlines for America, to discuss expanding the laptop policy to flights arriving from Europe.

Two airline officials briefed on the discussions said DHS gave no timetable for an announcement, but they were resigned to its inevitability. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the meeting publicly.

U.S. airlines say they still hope to have a say in how the policy is put into effect at airports to minimize inconvenience to passengers.

The current ban, which affects about 50 flights per day from 10 cities, does not prevent passengers from checking laptops and other electronic devices into luggage holds.

Still, the move could lead to fewer bookings and would complicate passengers' travel plans. The U.S. is a major destination for Europe-originated flights, with more than 10 million travelers flying there each year from destinations across the continent.

Caroline Bremner, head of travel at research firm Euromonitor International, said that before President Trump took office the U.S. was expected to see 85.2 million airline passenger arrivals by 2020. Under the new administration, arrivals to the U.S. are forecast to drop slightly to 84.2 million for the period.

The Chicago Sun-Times ran a cover story featuring Cubs superfan Ronnie “Woo Woo” Wickers, who claimed he was mistreated and targeted by security at Wrigley Field.

The defending World Series champion organization — holding firm that its reasoning for dismissing Wickers was based on no proof of a ticket — jabbed back on its official Twitter account. “Anyone else you want us to let in without a ticket?” the Cubs' account tweeted in response to the Sun-Times’ Friday cover picture of Wickers.

@Suntimes Anyone else you want us to let in without a ticket? — Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) May 12, 2017

Wickers is one of the most recognizable Cubs fans — he has sung for the 7th inning stretch and was the subject of a fandom documentary, “WooLife”. But he was removed by security from an April 19 game when he couldn’t produce his ticket. The Cubs claimed that Wickers had previously tried to enter the game without a ticket, prompting his ultimate removal.

Cubs spokesperson Julian Green told USA TODAY Sports: ""Throughout the years, Ronnie Wickers has attempted to enter Wrigley Field without a ticket, and he is politely turned away by staff. Wickers, like any other fan or celebrity, must have a ticket to attend a game at Wrigley Field. No exceptions.

""We take ticket integrity seriously, so if you attempt to enter a section in the first or seventh inning, you must produce a ticket when asked. We find it odd that Mr. Wickers is claiming some act of discrimination when he has attended several games since April 19 and received the same courtesy we would provide to all our guests.""

Green added that Wickers’ friend, Scott Miller, refused to show officials an e-ticket for Wickers and himself.

""(Miller) refused and verbally assaulted three members of our guest service staff, including a supervisor, which is a violation of our code of conduct,"" Green said. ""Cursing at our staff will get you and your guests a one-way ticket out of the ballpark, so Mr. Miller should proceed with caution if attending a future game.""

The 75-year-old Wickers, however, believes he was mistreated.

“They just lied about everything. I’m going to fight this with my last breath. I would like to sit down with Mr. Tom Ricketts for 10 minutes and let him roll back the videotape,” Wickers told the Sun-Times.

""This is simple,"" Green, the Cubs spokesman, said. ""Buy a ticket, politely show it when asked and enjoy a great day at the ballpark.""",usa-today

2017 also happens to mark the 150th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada. Which is why this mas band thought it was a good idea to ""celebrate"" with this.

@CityNews I am proud of my Caribbean culture. However on this, members of Indigenous community should have been engaged.

@CityNews Why are you even asking?

Now, if you're not quite sure ~why~ this is a bad thing, we'll break it down for you. Not only did Carnival Nationz get accused of appropriating Indigenous culture; people were pretty pissed that it was meant to be a celebration of Canada's 150th birthday.

Which Indigenous peoples have some... varying opinions on. @IPSMO1 Ottawa 2017: 150 Years of Genocide #canada150 #decolonize

Although some Indigenous peoples in Canada boycott the celebration of Canada Day, many are doing so especially this year for Canada's 150th birthday. Many believe the increased call for celebration is a means of distraction from contemporary Indigenous issues, as well as Canada's history with Indigenous peoples. In short, it feels like a celebration of colonization and genocide. So, ""honouring"" First Nations with cultural appropriation for Canada Day? Triple no.

Yikes. Cultural appropriation is also especially bad when it's supposed to be sexy. Nah @CNzInc, you guys screwed this one up. You don't get to steal the culture of Indigenous Canadians and claim it'… https://t.co/539uJzqoRK

Not only is the headdress considered a sacred object, it's also commonly viewed as "" pan-Indigenous "" (a term referring to the misconception/stereotype that all Indigenous people dress the same, look the same, etc.). View this photo on Instagram instagram.com That's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and National Chief Perry Bellegarde of the Assembly of First Nations.

Many chiefs reserve wearing of the headdress for special occasions and ceremonial purposes. (A.K.A. Not Coachella)

It is something to be treated with respect. This is Chief Red Cloud's warbonnet. This is who & what we rep. Honor the ancestors.

Native people culturally appropriate, too. First Nations Chicago Blackhawks fan wears fake headdress to a game and confuses everyone: http://t.co/uofAok6IHX In 2015, a man named Rob Bear stirred controversy after he was shown on-air wearing a headdress and drinking beer. He was reportedly approached at the Winnipeg Jets vs Chicago Blackhawks game but refused to take the headdress off.

The maelstrom that followed prompted the owners of the Winnipeg Jets to ban fake headdresses from their games . But cultural appropriation goes beyond headdresses.

That's some expensive cultural appropriation.

Sometimes, cultural appropriation is more subtle. For instance, in 2013, award-winning playwright Colleen Murphy came under fire for her play ""Pig Girl."" why would anyone EVER think a play titled ""Pig Girl"" telling the story of Robert Pickton is a good idea? http://t.co/wFZuMQMubj Yeah. Pig Girl is about Robert Pickton, considered one of the worst serial killers in Canadian history, who murdered women at his pig farm in BC. More specifically, the four-character play focuses on Pickton's victims and, by extension, on missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. The play went on to win a Governor General award. But many people, including the family members of one of Pickton's victims, were not so quick to praise the performance. Mainly, because a white woman felt it was her place to tell the tragic story.

And sometimes, cultural appropriation is just a slap in the face. School stands by decision to invite two white performers in headdresses to tell Indigenous stories https://t.co/apld01cFUf The Fort Nelson Secondary School recently stirred controversy after sharing photos to their Facebook page (which appear to have since been deleted) of white performers dressed up as... I don't really know what we call this. But it's a kick in the balls, especially considering ""real"" Indigenous people from the nearby Fort Nelson First Nation were never asked to present. Maybe because they don't have ""costumes.""

Whether in the form of plagiarism, sexualization, or outright just being an asshole, cultural appropriation is still a Canadian phenomenon in 2017. Instead of worrying about an apology or deleting evidence from social media, why don't we just stop doing it.",buzzfeed

4,We Tried To Copy Kim Kardashian's New Instagram Aesthetic And It Was Hard AF,"Kim has gradually eased back into posting shots that resemble her feed prior to the robbery (vacation shots, shots of her at work) but the sense of intimacy is still there. Additionally, the photos have a vintage quality to them (either because of the way Kim filters her photos, or because she's using actual film like a Polaroid).

Gone were the opulent shots flaunting her wealth and jet set lifestyle, replaced by images of her family (with husband Kanye West and children North and Saint), shots of everyday life (eating, lounging around the house), and simpler vibes (think outfit of the day, but staged at home instead of paparazzi shots).

— We also used the apps VSCO (to adjust everything from the exposure to the contrast) and Snapseed (this added the vintage glow) to filter our photos so they would look like the ones that are on Kim's feed.

— First of all, we weren't looking to copy Kim's poses or pictures. Rather, we wanted to replicate both the aesthetic and vibe of her post-Paris pictures on our own feed for 6-9 pictures.

We wanted to see what it would be like to replicate Kim's new and frankly ICONIC Instagram presence on our own feeds. Would it be difficult? Would we learn anything from the experience? Would Kris Jenner adopt us?

My Instagram is a pretty accurate representation of the things I love. I love national parks, trees, colorful landscapes and situations, and sharing my funky clothing choices. Honestly, before this I hadn't thought much about Kim's Instagram, I knew of it and had the sort of respect one has for another women doing her thing, but it wasn't on my personal radar. I thought my experience would be that of a someone who was present, yet detached. I thought I would glide through this with a filter or two, and some sarcasm.

Many of my photos on Instagram are basic shots of me smiling straight at the camera. I'm still trying to figure out my voice on Instagram which has gone from random photos on a whim, to more polished ""fashion blogger"" style photos. I think Kim is a master of imagery and telling stories through her likeness. I was captivated by her recent turn to the nostalgic, mystery, and vulnerability. Going into it, I was excited and confident that I could apply her aesthetic to my photos.

I think Kim's Instagram is very curated; going through it, it seems like I am getting both an intimate yet outsider's view of her life. I've wanted to make my Instagram grid look more aesthetically pleasing but usually give up because it requires planning the next 3 photos in advance. It'll be cool if this reaches me how to curate my feed better.

I didn't really think about what I posted before... just whatever I felt like. So i never actually really thought about it. I mainly posted photos that I liked or thought looked nice, and to share my life with friends or brag about cool food I'm eating ;) As for KIm, I like that she started having a clear aesthetic. I mainly follow Kim because it's fun to watch that lifestyle from afar.

I found Kim's return to the social media *FASCINATING* (I mean hello, she's like the Michelangelo of Instagram. Or maybe Michelangelo was the Kim K of painting? IDK.) Say what you like about her, but there's no one better at telling a story via how she presents herself to the public — every photo she posts is one more chapter in Kim Kardashian: The Story , unlike most plebeians who are posting basic food shots! That being said, I was actually most intrigued by how I was going to make MY feed look different during the experience. I don't think Kim and I are that different on social media — we both project a confidence and self assuredness, which I think is cool. In some ways, I was nervous this was going to be a little TOO easy!

Honestly, it was really weird. I felt like it made me take the pulse of our culture for a second, and really analyze why Kim Kardashian is the figure she is and how she's molded a reality show franchise into the creation of an icon. It was difficult in the sense that it reminded me of learning how to draw or paint for the first time. It's all about replicating stylistic traits and characteristics, instead of just doing whatever you want. I found that giving up my freedom as an artist was irksome, but at times enlightening. It made me think more about things that I could be adding, or taking away from a photo to give it a certain feeling or sense. People really liked the pictures, and thought they had a mysterious quality.

My strategy was to master the following iPhone photo editing apps VSCO Cam, Snapseed, and UNUM to get the right look. For content, I aimed to capture the mystery and intimacy portrayed through Kim's photos. In her photos, the viewer feels dropped into a weekend afternoon with her family. It's weird but I get a feeling of wanting to hug the subjects in her photos. The biggest challenge for me was running out of ""everyday poses"" that still looked photographable. This challenge was fun because I've never posted photos like these before. I feel like I did pretty well. It did go against my instincts to blur and add grain to the photos since my generation has been conditioned to take the highest definition photos possible. To my surprise, commenters not only noticed this new aesthetic but also really wanted to know what filters I used! I also received positive comments from people who've never commented on my photos before.

Kim's Instagram look is often described as ""vintage"" and ""personal,"" so I thought I'd convey those themes in my own style. The first photo I posted was at a cafe: I do most of my writing there and find that to be a personal activity. But then I was told Kim wouldn't post that! Because the photos we were shown of her feed all had people looking away from the camera, I then posted a photo where I was looking off to the side. I was told I'd done it right this time, so that's what I stuck with. The most difficult part was asking my friends to take pictures of me that are posed but supposed to look candid. A big group walked by during one of them.

It was much harder than I thought. I'm not a model or actor so I never think about how I'm posing my body. It felt weird and sort of narcissistic to do it. But I ended up having fun with it. It was cool to have a reason to post photos, and my strategy was basically try not to quit, keep with it, and challenge myself out of my comfort zone. I started to feel slightly annoyed that i had to edit the photos so much — I'm used to just posting right away. It felt weird to save photos and actually put thought into what they would look like as a group. By the end it started to feel like a burden. Social media isn't a part of my job, it's a fun perk. I'm glad that it's separate from my life and I can do it whenever I feel like. It must be hard for public figures to have it so intertwined, like I have to post everyday, it's a part of my business, it's also how I express myself. Posting on a schedule made it less fun for me.

Since I don't have two kids like Kim, I tried to replicate her vibe of intimacy and confidence in my posts for the week. I think it kind of worked, because by the end of the experience, I was getting called out in the comments for filtering my photos like the Kardashians! That being said, getting it right took a LOT of work. I had to bring outfits to work, as co-workers to take pictures of me, and then take about 20-30 pictures to get ONE picture. And that's BEFORE using three — THREE!!! — apps to get the aesthetic right. Being a Kardashian seems exhausting! By the end of the week I was glad it was over. I was tired of taking pictures every day, I was tired of using all the filters, and I was tired of trying to be like Kim.

Final thoughts:

Kuwilileni: I learned that the Kim K of 5 years ago and the Kim K of today are very different people. She’s been molded by time and circumstance into something deeper then what I perceived her as before. I think her Instragram has a high level of thoughtfulness, each picture crafted to perfectly articulate herself. I've always been a lover of analog photography, and these series of photographs serve as a reminder of why I believe the quality of grain and light can have an affect on mood.

Kane: Overall, I learned that it's super fun to show different sides of your life and that I should experiment more with camera angles, filters, and poses. I learned how creative I can get with Instagram rather than just taking a traditionally ""good"" photo. I have even more appreciation of Kim's grasp of storytelling, marketing, and true mastery over her of image. Going forward, I definitely want explore new and creative ways I can tell my own story through Instagram, and now I have more tools to do so. I will also now start to think about feelings a photo conveys rather than only looking at them technically.

Rachel: It's a skill how Kim controls her narrative partly through her social media. People responded best to my photo where I'm eating Hot Cheetos and browsing the Internet because it's relatable. I think that's why she did the family photo series: celebrities want to be relatable as much as they want to be aspirational. I realized that all of us organize our social media to convey specific things about ourselves.

Ella: Overall, I think she has a really cool aesthetic. I wish that I always had someone to take, style, and help me edit my photos. It definitely takes a lot more work than it seems. I think that what I learned is that I'm pretty low maintenance when comes to social media. Adding extra steps / apps didn't seem worth it. At first I was nervous about posting photos that were a little more intimate or personal than i'm used to but in the end it was fun to open up a little in that way. What i'll take going forward is maybe being more mindful of keeping a photographic aesthetic -- not necessarily Kim's but maybe one that becomes my own.

Sam: I have a newfound respect for the amount of effort Kim K (and other social media stars) put into presenting their lives on social media. Prior to the experience, my idea of ""Instagram"" was taking a cute picture, maybe slapping a filter on it, and posting it. But trying to post like Kim shed some light on how Instagram can be used to tell a story, and the amount of time and consideration that goes in to doing so.

9,Adam Petty remembered on anniversary of his passing | FOX Sports,"When people spoke about Adam Petty as he was coming up through the stock-car ranks, the buzz was that he could talk like his father, Kyle, and drive like his grandfather, Richard Petty.

Sadly, Adam never got to realize his full potential as a driver, perishing 17 years ago today in a crash during practice for a NASCAR XFINITY Series race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. He was just 19 years old.

Above all else, Adam shared two things with his famous father and grandfather: The first was the broad, easy Petty grin, a warm and friendly smile for anyone who was near. The second was a devotion to community and serving others.

Although Adam is no longer physically present, his values and his service can still be found at Victory Junction Gang Camp, the camp founded for kids in Adam’s honor.

Victory Junction, in Randleman, North Carolina, enriches the lives of children with serious illnesses by providing life-changing camping experiences that are exciting, fun and empowering, at no cost to children or their families.

To honor Adam’s memory and raise money for Victory Junction, Kyle is getting ready to start his annual Kyle Petty Charity Ride, which begins May 13 in Portland, Oregon, and wraps up May 19 in Milwaukee.

9,Happy Hour practice results for Go Bowling 400 | FOX Sports,"Practice is now complete for Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Kansas Speedway following the second of two sessions at the 1.5-mile track on Friday.

Tops in the 85-minute practice was defending race winner Kyle Busch, who ran a best lap of 187.963 miles per hour in his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota.

Second fast was Cup Series points leader Kyle Larson at 187.833 mph. Larson was followed by Martin Truex Jr., who topped the speed charts in the morning practice.

Rounding out the top five were Ryan Blaney and Brad Keselowski. Dale Earnhardt Jr. finished ninth.

There was one major incident and it involved points leader Larson.

Just six minutes into practice, Larson got loose in Turn 2 and hit the wall, forcing his Chip Ganassi Racing crew to pull out the team’s back-up car. Later in the session, Larson’s teammate, Jamie McMurray, brushed the wall, but his damage was considerably less.

Larson said he’d been wrestling with his car all day long. “I felt like I was going to crash every lap since we unloaded today,” said Larson. “We only made like seven laps the first practice because I was spinning out every time.”

And it was a problem that was not confined to Larson.

“I’ve been extremely loose all day. I think a lot of people have,” said Larson. “I don’t know why we are all fighting loose, but we made some big adjustments between the two practices there and I was still really loose.”

Also notable in practice: Carl Long practiced for a Cup Series race for the first time since 2009, when he was fined $200,000 for running a borrowed engine that was 0.17 cubic inches too large during practice for the Sprint Showdown last-chance all-star qualifying race at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

Long was 39th of 39 drivers in terms of speed, more than three seconds off the top lap turned in the session. But he made it on track, which is what matters.

Cup qualifying is tonight at 6:45 p.m., with the race on Saturday night, with coverage starting at 7 p.m. ET. Both qualifying and the race will be on FS1.

9,Who's winning the Carson Wentz trade: The Browns or the Eagles? | FOX Sports,"Leading up to last year’s NFL Draft, the Cleveland Browns were desperate for a quarterback. The Philadelphia Eagles were not. Sam Bradford was entrenched as the starter, giving them a decent, very capable quarterback to go into the season with.

Yet, it was the Eagles who made a shocking move up from No. 8 to No. 2, trading a boatload of picks in order to do so. The trade wound up costing Philadelphia two first-round picks (one in 2017), a third- and fourth-rounder in 2016 and a second-round pick in 2018. The Eagles effectively got Wentz and a 2017 fourth-rounder in exchange for five picks, a haul that looked like a major win for the Browns.

The Browns decided to trade down in both 2016 and 2017, turning those five selections into a whopping nine players.

Incredibly, they’re not done making picks from that monumental trade last year. The Browns still have a first- and second-round pick to use next year as a result of the trade.",fox-sports
9,5 reasons to watch UFC 211: Miocic vs. dos Santos 2 | FOX Sports,"Will Joanna be challenged?

9,No. 1 overall pick Myles Garrett admits he ‘can’t be a savior’ for the Browns | FOX Sports,"The Cleveland Browns are in desperate need of a player who can resurrect the franchise and get it back on the winning track. That player will likely be a quarterback one day, but the Browns have yet to find the right man for the job.

Some hope that No. 1 overall pick Myles Garrett can save the team on the defensive side of the ball, but even he knows that’s impossible. He admitted as much Friday when speaking about the Browns in 2017.

“It takes a culmination of all these guys coming together and just having the attitude that we’re not going to lose. And that’s what we’re going to do. I can’t be a savior,” Garrett said, via NFL.com. “But I can be the best I can be. I can give it my all and make plays and dominate my side of the field, but it takes all 11 guys with a certain thought process that we’re going to go out there and we’re going to win.”

Garrett is going to be a Day 1 starter for the Browns and is the favorite to win Defensive Rookie of the Year. He has all the makings of a cornerstone defender in the mold of Von Miller and J.J. Watt, which should provide the fan base with some excitement.

That being said, he’s not going to win the Browns games without a lot of help. He’s not going to turn them into a playoff team after they won just one game in 2016.

Garrett said himself that “one person can’t win games,” making it clear that it takes an entire team to have success in the NFL. Sure, his play as a rookie will help the Browns win more often in 2017 – or at least they hope so – but he can’t do it all.

He remains as confident as ever, though, after saying he wants to sack Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger most in the NFL – and he plans to back it up.

“You just gotta back up your words. Don’t be scared from it or don’t shy from it,” Garrett said. “Make sure, if you’re willing to say something, that you worked hard enough and prepared well enough to back those things up.”",fox-sports

6,Source: Comey is 'not worried about any tapes',"The source said of the dinner between Comey and Trump on January 27 that it came at Trump's request and was one-on-one. Trump told NBC he thought Comey asked for the dinner, but the source denied the President's account, saying that if Comey had wanted to dine with Trump, he would have had to put the request in through the deputy attorney general.

""It doesn't work that way. It's ludicrous,"" the source said.

A few days before the dinner, Comey had already been told by the President that he would stay on the job, the source said.

""It is absolutely untrue that Jim asked to have dinner or that he asked to have his job,"" the source said. ""That is a complete fabrication.""

As CNN has previously reported, Comey's refusal to pledge loyalty is one of the reasons the President fired him, the other being the acceleration of the probe into alleged collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, another source close to Comey has said.

The source said Comey knew it was possible he would lose his job, especially when he did not agree to pledge loyalty and later with the fallout over refuting the President's claims that President Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower, but he didn't expect it when he was fired.

The source said Comey is likely not going to testify next week to Senate intelligence. As of Friday morning, Comey had not responded to the request.

""He loved his job and the mission,"" said the source, who added, ""he'll be fine.""

The source also confirmed previously reported accounts that Comey learned of his firing by catching it on TV -- initially, Comey thought it was a joke, and teased agents around him for teasing him. Then someone pull him aside and told him it was true, the source said.

The source said Comey thought at least he would get a phone call, adding, ""the way (Trump) did it was remarkable.""

Shifting accounts of firing

The initial, official White House version of how Comey came to be fired was that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

But mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russia probe.

Sources have told CNN that Trump's decision to ax Comey was made after he grew increasingly frustrated with him following a congressional hearing last week in which he said he was ""mildly nauseous"" over the idea that he helped sway the 2016 election.

Trump's surrogates, including Vice President Mike Pence, have struggled to keep up with the shifting narrative on how and why the decision was made, and Trump tweeted Friday it was ""not possible"" for his team to recount details and talking points with ""perfect accuracy.""

On Thursday, Trump, discussing the firing of Comey, told NBC News that he was frustrated by the ongoing investigation and believed it was motivated by Democrats' fury at losing the election.

Trump told NBC's Lester Holt: ""And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.'""

Trump also reiterated in the interview Thursday that Comey told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation for his campaign's alleged ties to Russian intelligence officials.

""He told me that ... and I've heard that from others,"" Trump told Holt.

The President said Comey told him he was not under investigation once during a ""very nice dinner"" and two other times over the phone -- comments consistent with the letter Trump sent Comey informing him that he had been fired: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau,"" Trump wrote.

There are still questions, however, as to whether Comey actually did tell Trump he was not under investigation at the dinner on January 27 and two more times by phone. Those close to Comey tell CNN they find it hard to believe he would speak about an ongoing investigation. Still, the conversations were one-on-one, making it impossible for the sources to know for sure.

One source was unwilling to tell CNN what was said about the investigation except that what was discussed was more nuanced than the way the President described it.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said as well in remarks at a committee markup Thursday that he and ranking member Dianne Feinstein ""heard nothing that contradicted the President's statement"" when Comey briefed them about the targets of the various investigations. Grassley added: ""It would not be appropriate for me to reveal those details before the professionals conducting the investigations are ready.""",cnn
6,"Sean Spicer isn't saying whether President Trump tapes his phone calls. Wait, what?","Washington (CNN) Six hours after President Donald Trump implied that he could be taping phone calls with now-deposed FBI Director James Comey , White House press secretary Sean Spicer refused to rule that possibility out.

Stop. Go back and read that first sentence again. Ok. Moving on.

""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer repeated again and again as he was blitzed with questions about the ""tape"" tweet . ""The tweet speaks for itself.""

Deep breath.

So, here's what we know: The president of the United States made a not-so-subtle threat against the FBI director he fired to stay quiet because he might just have recorded the phone calls between the two of them. The White House press secretary, when given a chance to say definitively that no such recording happened, took a pass.

Now ask yourself this: If Trump wasn't recording phone calls, why wouldn't Spicer jump at the opportunity to clarify that as soon as humanly possible? After all, secretly recording phone calls in the White House has been off limits since Richard Nixon did so -- to great personal damage -- during his presidency.

Why, in a week in which Trump is already being compared to Nixon for his firing of Comey, would the White House not immediately swat the story down if it wasn't true?

There are two possible answers to that question as far as I can tell:

Trump refuses to acknowledge he got way over his skis in that tweet Friday morning Trump is recording his phone calls.

I genuinely don't know which one is more likely at this point.

My natural tendency would be to assume that of course Trump isn't recording phone calls because that would be incredibly cavalier and dangerous. But, this is Donald Trump we're talking about. He built a reputation and a career on saying and doing things no one else would even consider saying or doing. And it got him elected president. So, why would he feel constrained once he was sitting in the Oval Office?

On the other hand, Trump is famous (infamous?) for never saying sorry or even looking backward. His stubbornness has caused him and his staff untold agita in his first 112 days in office. One example: Trump's tweet that he was being wiretapped by President Obama during the 2016 campaign has been debunked by everyone in a position to know. And yet Trump stands by it -- trying desperately to find a way out that doesn't involve him admitting he made it up. (His latest tactic is to elide his allegation of wiretapping with the broader surveillance being conducted by the National Security Agency.)

Which is it then? I genuinely have no idea.

But no matter the reasons for Trump's sort-of insinuation and Spicer's refusal to knock down the idea, we now have real cause to wonder whether this president of the United States has a secret phone recording system up and running.

What a thing to contemplate.",cnn

6,Comey turmoil puts Trump's isolation on view,"Washington (CNN) Days after his abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump's attempts to triage the fallout only plunged the episode further into confusion.

Conflicting accounts of how and why the firing happened ricocheted across Washington Thursday, each seeming to push the decision closer to Comey's oversight of an investigation into Russian election meddling.

Trump himself linked the decision to the Russia probe in an interview. His spokeswoman suggested Comey's dismissal could hasten the inquiry.

The turmoil surrounding Comey's dismissal has frustrated the President and his senior-most aides, according to people familiar with the situation. All have expressed anger that the decision to fire Comey wasn't properly executed and created a sharp backlash. The topic has all but consumed the West Wing, where Trump remains holed up Friday, his seventh straight day without a public event.

Attempts to move on from the firing have been minimal. Trump's own official schedule remains empty, leaving some of his allies wondering whether his governing agenda has veered drastically off course. Even the normal parade of photo-ops has been scrapped; instead, Trump signed two executive orders behind closed doors Thursday, avoiding any more questions about his decision to remove Comey from his post.

It all led to the impression of a commander in chief operating in chaotic isolation while leaving even his closest allies to pick up the pieces. Trump seemed to confirm the situation himself on Twitter Friday morning.

'I was going to fire Comey'

There are few signs that the crisis is close to lifting.

On Friday morning, Trump fired off a thinly veiled threat to Comey: ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press.""

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

The tweet marks an extraordinary development in the ongoing feud between Trump and the agencies investigating alleged ties between his campaign and Russia.

Trump also threw two days of official White House accounts into dispute by insisting he'd long planned to fire Comey, even before his Justice Department provided him a reason, and suggesting he was thinking about the FBI's Russia investigation when he made the decision.

""When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,' "" Trump told NBC News.

""Regardless of the recommendation,"" Trump told NBC, ""I was going to fire Comey.""

That flew in the face of what his top deputies -- including Vice President Mike Pence -- had said publicly about the incident in the 24 hours after the dismissal. Pence said seven times on Capitol Hill Wednesday that Trump acted only after receiving the recommendation to fire Comey from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Trump's spokeswoman, explaining her own statements that seemed to be contradicted by the President's interview, said Trump hadn't told her that he was long planning to dismiss his FBI director.

""I hadn't had a chance to have the conversation directly,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday. ""I went off of the information I had when I answered your question. I've since had the conversation with him, right before I walked on today. And he laid it out very clearly. He had already made that decision. He had been thinking about it for months.""

Meanwhile, the FBI's acting director told a congressional panel that Comey enjoyed ""broad support"" at the FBI, further undercutting Trump's explanation that Comey had been dismissed because he'd lost the support of his staff.

Toxic atmosphere

In his interview, Trump said Comey had fostered a toxic atmosphere at the FBI, which his dismissal was meant to remedy. But on Capitol Hill, the agency's acting director denied that rank-and-file agents at the bureau were dissatisfied with their leadership. Instead, he said Comey commanded widespread respect among his employees, including himself.

""I hold Director Comey in the absolute highest regard,"" said the acting director, Andrew McCabe. ""I have the highest respect for his considerable abilities and his integrity.""

He said Comey enjoyed ""broad support within the FBI and still does to this day"" and added ""the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep, positive connection to Director Comey.""

People within the bureau said the firing had caused anger among agents toward Trump. A planned visit by Trump to FBI headquarters this week never materialized.

""He wouldn't have been received well,"" one official said of the President, noting the bureau remains shellshocked over Comey's firing.

At the White House, tensions were high. Many top officials placed blame on the press office for its handling of the situation, though few in the communications wing had advance warning that Trump was planning to fire Comey.

One official called the attempts to handle the aftermath an ""embarrassment. Another termed the cleanup attempts ""a disaster.""

The President himself thought it was ""handled poorly,"" according to one person familiar with Trump's thinking.

The scramble to contain the fallout of Trump's decision reflects a sudden change for a president who, less than a week ago, was celebrating a major victory: passage of a Republican health care plan in the House of Representatives. The moment has proven distracting for a President facing a series of hard decisions about US policy, as well as a grueling five-stop foreign swing that begins in just over a week.

Grudges

Trump himself signaled his continued preoccupation with the matter Thursday afternoon, sending a message on Twitter citing his longtime nemesis, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who called for Comey's dismissal in December.

""We finally agree on something Rosie,"" the President wrote. Moments later, he continued his Twitter tirade: ""Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.""

Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2017

The messages reflected Trump's longstanding preoccupation with the claims his campaign coordinated with Russia during last year's election. Trump has viewed the claims -- along with the FBI investigation into them -- as a challenge to the legitimacy of his presidency, according to people who have spoken with him.

Trump has been nearly perpetually frustrated by Russia probe, which he believes has overshadowed parts of his agenda, according to people familiar with his thinking.

Trump also bore a grudge against Comey for shooting down his claims during public congressional testimony that Trump's phones had been tapped by President Barack Obama's administration, according to sources.

But firing Comey did not end the conversation about the FBI's look into Russian meddling; if anything, the story has emerged with renewed force.

Trump said that Comey had requested the dinner ""because he wanted to stay on,"" even though FBI directors serve 10-year terms that span presidential administrations.

""You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,"" McCabe said.

Meanwhile, at the White House, Trump's spokeswoman suggested that Comey's firing could hasten the FBI's work.

""We want this to come to its conclusion, we want it to come to its conclusion with integrity,"" Sanders said, referring to the FBI's probe into Moscow's interference in last year's election. ""And we think that we've actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen.""",cnn
6,This is the most WTF week in Washington in a long time,"(CNN) Remember that time when former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified in front of a Senate committee that she had warned White House counsel Don McGahn that national security adviser Michael Flynn was compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target?

That happened less than five days ago.

This week in politics has seemed more like a month as stories -- like the one involving Yates, Flynn and McGahn -- that would have been MASSIVE news in a normal week are forgotten amid the next MASSIVE story to break.

Walk down memory lane with me. And remember that all of these things have happened in the last 96 hours.

Tuesday, May 9

The day is dominated by talk of why Trump didn't fire Flynn for 18 days after Yates told McGahn about her concerns. Then, just before 6 p.m. ET, Trump fires FBI Director James Comey. Minutes later, CNN breaks the news that grand jury subpoenas have been delivered to associates of Flynn in connection with the ongoing FBI investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The White House communications shop goes into panic mode, with press secretary Sean Spicer's now-infamous among-the-bushes-in-the-dark briefing as the highlight/lowlight.

Wednesday, May 10

Vice President Mike Pence goes to Capitol Hill to argue that President Trump fired Comey because of a memo penned by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein arguing that Comey lost the confidence of the FBI with his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. (Trump would directly contradict that assertion less than 24 hours later.) Then, Trump does a photo-op with former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger even while comparisons of his firing of Comey to Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" swirl.

Later, pictures emerge of a smiling Trump shaking hands and laughing with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Yes, the same Kislyak at the center of the Flynn investigation. And the guy who Attorney General Jeff Sessions forgot he met with twice during the 2016 campaign, leading to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe.

It makes me tired just writing it all.

The pace at which the news moves in the Trump presidency is, literally, unheard of -- the result of the fast-twitch social media culture, Trump's unpredictability, the level of interest (positive and negative) in everything and he does and, frankly, the long hours he keeps.

It's easy amid the barrage -- and every week has been a maelstrom if not the Category 5 level of this week -- to forget things that happened even a day or two ago.

Some of that is a concerted strategy on Trump's part. If you throw 100 balls into the air every day, no one can catch them all. He has, throughout his life, shown a penchant for using a new headline (of his own making) to bump down a less favorable headline. He thinks and acts like a cable TV producer and he knows that whatever is freshest is what usually dominates.

But there's more here too. The pace at which Trump moves and acts -- and tweets -- often feels manic, as though he is playing right on the edge between strategic and totally out of control.

The events of this week seem to be firmly in the out-of-control space. Trump and his White House seem to be careening from one political/public-relations disaster to another. There appears to be no consistent message, no consistent strategy and no real plan to get one.

The image that keeps coming to my mind is Trump, alone, angry and tweeting, while his staff runs around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to put out a fire -- even as two more start behind them.

Being unpredictable and unorthodox is one thing. Being totally out of control -- a car with no brakes, a roller coaster car running out of track -- is another. And Trump's White House finds itself jammed into that car -- with no clear sense of where they're headed -- right about now.",cnn
16,Massive ransomware attack hits 99 countries,"Tens of thousands of ransomware attacks are targeting organizations around the world on Friday.

Cybersecurity firm Avast said it has tracked more than 75,000 attacks in 99 countries. It said the majority of the attacks targeted Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan.

What is it?

The ransomware locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them.

The ransomware, called ""WannaCry,"" is spread by taking advantage of a Windows vulnerability that Microsoft released a security patch for in March. But computers and networks that haven't updated their systems are at risk. The exploit was leaked last month as part of a trove of NSA spy tools.

""Affected machines have six hours to pay up and every few hours the ransom goes up,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, the principal security researcher at security firm Kaspersky Lab. ""Most folks that have paid up appear to have paid the initial $300 in the first few hours.""

Sixteen National Health Service (NHS) organizations in the UK have been hit, and some of those hospitals have canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible. Spanish telecom company Telefónica was also hit with the ransomware.

Spanish authorities confirmed the ransomware is spreading through the vulnerability, called ""EternalBlue,"" and advised people to patch.

""It is going to spread far and wide within the internal systems of organizations -- this is turning into the biggest cybersecurity incident I've ever seen,"" UK-based security architect Kevin Beaumont said.

Russia's Interior Ministry released a statement acknowledging a ransomware attack on its computers, adding that less than 1% of computers were affected, and that the virus is now ""localized."" The statement said antivirus systems are working to destroy it.

Megafon, a Russian telecommunications company, was also hit by the attack. Spokesman Petr Lidov told CNN that it affected call centers but not the company's networks. He said the situation is now under control.

Kaspersky Lab says although the WannaCry ransomware can infect computers even without the vulnerability, EternalBlue is ""the most significant factor"" in the global outbreak.

How to prevent it

Beaumont examined a sample of the ransomware used to target NHS and confirmed it was the same used to target Telefónica. He said companies can apply the patch released in March to all systems to prevent WannaCry infections. Although it won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

He said it's likely the ransomware will spread to U.S. firms too. The ransomware is automatically scanning for computers it can infect whenever it loads itself onto a new machine. It can infect other computers on the same wireless network.

""It has a 'hunter' module, which seeks out PCs on internal networks,"" Beaumont said. ""So, for example, if your laptop is infected and you went to a coffee shop, it would spread to PCs at the coffee shop. From there, to other companies.""

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, Friday's attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion. When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.

6,Warner: Comey won't testify to intel panel next week,"Story highlights Comey was invited to testify on Tuesday

Acting FBI Director testified on Thursday

Washington (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey will not testify before the Senate intelligence committee next week, according to the panel's vice chairman, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.

""We just heard from the director that he's not able to make Tuesday,"" Warner told CNN's Manu Raju. ""It's my hope that that we will be able to find a time. I think it's really important that the Congress, and more broadly the American people, hear Director Comey's side of the story.""

Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump on Tuesday, was invited to speak before the committee in a closed session. The former official was in charge of the bureau's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The Virginia Democrat told MSNBC earlier Friday that Comey would not appear next week.

The intelligence committee issued a subpoena this week to former national security adviser Michael Flynn for documents regarding his interactions with Russian officials.

16,Proof that even airlines are confused about the electronics ban,"Even airlines are confused by the electronics ban on flights to America.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) briefly posted a sign in its Cincinnati terminal Friday warning international travelers that they would have to check any electronics, other than a cell phone, when flying back to the United States: ""Effective May 12 passengers will only be permitted to carry a cell phone onboard flights returning to the United States. All other personal electronics devices will be required to be checked.""

But although the Trump administration is considering whether to ban laptops and other large devices from cabins on flights from Europe to the United States, no such ban is in effect yet. U.S. and European officials have been discussing an expansion this week, but for now, the ban still only applies to flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and Africa. That rule went into effect in March.

Related: U.S. laptop ban could hit 350 flights a day from Europe

Delta has direct flights from Cincinnati to three foreign airports -- Paris, Toronto and Cancun. Mexico and Canada are not part of the ban discussions as of now. A Delta spokesman apologized for the confusion that the sign caused and said it's been removed. It only appeared in Cincinnati, but it lives on social media.

3,FBI chief sacking: Trump warns Comey over leaks to media,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Trump has insisted he was told by Mr Comey that he was not under investigation

US President Donald Trump has warned fired FBI chief James Comey against leaking material to the media.

He tweeted that Mr Comey had ""better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations"", suggesting such tapes, if they existed, might contradict him.

Mr Comey, who had been leading an inquiry into possible collusion between Trump election campaign officials and Russia, was fired on Tuesday.

Mr Trump has insisted Mr Comey told him that he was not under investigation.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer later said Mr Trump had nothing more to say on the ""tapes"" but that the tweet the president had put out was ""not a threat"" to Mr Comey.

Read more:

Mr Trump has said that Mr Comey has told him three times that he was not a target of the FBI inquiry, comments that have raised accusations among opponents that the president was interfering in the investigation.

Mr Trump also said this week that he alone was responsible for the decision to sack Mr Comey, calling him a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"".

But this appeared to undermine earlier comments from administration officials that Mr Comey had been fired on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein.

The first line of Mr Trump's letter sacking Mr Comey refers to a memo written by Mr Rosenstein and says: ""I have accepted their recommendation"".

But he later told NBC he was ""going to fire him regardless of the recommendation"".

The White House said Mr Comey was fired over his handling of the Hillary Clinton email affair, but Democrats have asked, if that is the case, why it took so long.

'Flooding the zone': Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher

Donald Trump was reportedly unhappy with how his press team handled fallout from Tuesday's decision to fire Mr Comey, so he's taken things into his own hands. Boy, has he.

First he gave an interview that essentially undercut all the arguments White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, had made to paint the Comey sacking as an operation conducted through normal channels. Now he has taken to Twitter in earnest, spraying a barrage of allegations, accusations and aggressions against Democrats, the media and Mr Comey himself.

In sports terms, the strategy could be described as ""flooding the zone"" - launching a ferocious, full-out assault to overwhelm an opponent's defences. In this case, Mr Trump has the media scrambling to decide which story merits the most coverage.

Is it the details of the Comey-Trump dinner and the president's hints of secret ""tapes""? His threat to cancel press briefings? The Oval Office visit by a Russian entourage? Perhaps, as Mr Trump suggests, the ""real news"" is the tentative trade agreement between the US and China on beef and poultry products?

When everything is a big story, nothing is. At least, that's what Mr Trump may hope.

There is also a suggestion Mr Comey had asked for more resources for the FBI inquiry.

Then there is a New York Times report this week which said that, during a one-on-one dinner in late January, Mr Trump had asked Mr Comey for a pledge of loyalty but it was not forthcoming.

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC on Friday he had spoken to Mr Comey before the dinner, and the FBI head had said he was ""uneasy"" about it as it might compromise his inquiry.

Mr Spicer later said that the president had not asked for a pledge of loyalty.

'Witch hunt'

Apparently angered by criticism of the different accounts of the sacking, Mr Trump used another of his tweets on Friday to say: ""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!""

He added: ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future 'press briefings' and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

Mr Spicer said the president was a ""little dismayed"" that the attempts of his press team to give out information were being turned into a ""game of gotcha"" by the media.

It was unclear whether Mr Trump's reference to ""tapes"" suggested there might be secret recordings of conversations that could be used to challenge any statements by Mr Comey, or whether it was simply a way of warding him off from commenting.

Mr Spicer said he was not aware of any recording of the dinner with Mr Comey.

The reference to tapes has done nothing to silence the echoes of the Watergate affair that have resounded around the Russian interference inquiry.

In 1973, President Richard Nixon sacked Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor who was seeking access to tapes of presidential conversations that ultimately led to Mr Nixon's resignation.

CNN cited an unnamed source as saying Mr Comey was ""not worried about any tapes"" Mr Trump may have of their conversations.

Mr Trump has dismissed the FBI investigation as a ""charade"" and has said Democrats are using ""fake news"" about collusion with the Russians as an excuse for losing the election.

In another tweet on Friday, Mr Trump said: ""When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?""

However, Mr Comey's successor, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, said on Thursday that it remained ""a highly significant investigation"".

In testimony to the Senate intelligence committee, he also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of his staff.

""I can confidently tell you that the vast majority of employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,"" Mr McCabe said.

Separately on Friday, Mr Trump's lawyers said a review of the past 10 years of his tax returns showed ""no income of any type from Russian sources"". Although there was income from a beauty pageant and the sale of a property in Russia, there was ""no equity investment by Russians"" and no money owed by Russians to Mr Trump, a letter, printed here by the New York Times, said.",bbc-news
9,West Bromwich Albion 0-1 Chelsea,"Media playback is not supported on this device Full-time scenes as Chelsea seal title

Chelsea secured their fifth Premier League title with a dramatic late victory at West Brom.

Substitute Michy Batshuayi scored in the 82nd minute to secure the vital win, sliding in to turn home Cesar Azpilicueta's cut-back from close range.

After nearest rivals Tottenham lost against West Ham on 5 May, Chelsea needed only two wins from their final four matches to take the trophy.

They convincingly beat Middlesbrough 3-0 on Monday and wrapped things up with victory at The Hawthorns.

Chelsea were made to work hard on the night by a resolute West Brom.

The Blues had 14 shots on goal in the first half, including Cesc Fabregas' bending effort which went wide.

Victor Moses struck through the legs of James McClean, only to be denied by a brilliant save from Ben Foster after the break.

West Brom took control of the match, as Salomon Rondon's shot deflected wide after a rapid counter-attack and Nacer Chadli clipped his effort past the post.

But then Batshuayi scored his second league goal of the season, sending the Chelsea players and manager Antonio Conte into frenzied celebrations.

Conte becomes only the fourth manager to lift the Premier League trophy in his first season in England, emulating Jose Mourinho in 2004-05, Carlo Ancelotti in 2009-10 and Manuel Pellegrini in 2013-14.

And the Italian has claimed a fourth successive league title as a manager - adding to the three Serie A trophies he won with Juventus.

'This game typified Chelsea's season'

Former England midfielder Jermaine Jenas told BBC Radio 5 live: ""These celebrations are unbelievable.

""It is thoroughly deserved. They have been the best team this season.

""The changes Conte has made to change their season around can't be underestimated.

""When their backs have been against the wall tonight, they defended well. This game typified Chelsea's season. How many winners they have in their team makes them special.

""But tactically, individually, what Conte has done with these players and to bring them together is sensational.""

3,Costa Concordia captain's sentence upheld by Italy court,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Francesco Schettino was sentenced in 2015

Italy's highest court has upheld the 16-year jail sentence given to the captain of the Costa Concordia, which capsized in 2012 killing 32 people.

Francesco Schettino had handed himself in to the Rebibbia prison in Rome after the verdict, his lawyer said.

Schettino was sentenced in 2015 after a court found him guilty of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident and abandoning ship.

The cruise ship capsized after hitting rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio.

Schettino was nicknamed ""Captain Coward"" by the media, after the coastguard released recordings of him in a lifeboat resisting orders to return to the stricken vessel.

More than 4,000 people were aboard at the time and were forced into a chaotic evacuation.

Prosecutors say he steered too close to the island to show off to a dancer, Domnica Cemortan, who was with him at the helm.

But he blamed communication problems with the Indonesian helmsman.

The court ruling was welcomed by a lawyer representing relatives of the victims, who said it represented justice at last.

The sentence included 10 years for manslaughter, five for causing the shipwreck, one for abandoning the ship before passengers and crew were clear, and one month for lying to the authorities afterwards.

Costa Crociere, the company that owned the ship, sidestepped potential criminal charges in 2013 by agreeing to pay a €1m ($1.1m; £769,000) fine.

Five of Schettino's colleagues were also jailed for up to three years in earlier cases.",bbc-news
10,Microsoft unveils the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update,"Microsoft has announced that its next big update to Windows 10 will be the Fall Creators Update and it’s coming later this year.

You might be thinking, ‘wait a minute, didn’t the Creators Update just roll out?’ And you’d be right, but Microsoft says their not done making its operating system even better for creative types.

Windows Story Remix

At the center of this upcoming Windows 10 build is a new creative app called Windows Story Remix. Its most interesting aspect is that it allows users to create mixed reality content. Microsoft demoed the app by adding 3D objects to photos and video to help tell stories users can explore.

Otherwise, the new app is essentially about helping users create shareable memories out of their photos and videos by automatically stitching them together. From there, users can add little creative touches like a soundtrack, theme, cinematic transitions (read: star wipes), or even draw and write on them with Windows Ink.

The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will hit many of the best 2-in-1 laptops

Windows Story Remix is also a collaborative app, that allows users to share media. For example multiple parents could all shoot different angles of a soccer game and the app will automatically pull together the footage to create a highlight reel.

With face recognition, users could also tell Windows Story remix to make a certain person the start of the video.

While this app is currently untitled, it seems like it will be an interesting new wrinkle to the Windows 10 experience and feels like a perfect fit for Windows 10 Mobile and its lineup of smartphones – which we have no doubt it will land on eventually.

Image 1 of 3 Windows 10 is getting a big makeover Image 2 of 3 Hello white taskbar Image 3 of 3 Apps get a new look too

Fluent Design System

At the heart of the Fall Creators Update is a new user interface called the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which both changes the look and how you interact with apps. Originally code named Project Neon , Fluent Design will drive more expressive and engaging apps for a wide range of devices.

Secondly, the new design language hopes to tackle input diversity head on. With a modern Windows 10 device, users can interact with touch, ink, voice, gaze and gesture. Simply put, Fluent Design hopes to create a more harmonious and responsive cross-device experience.

Pick up and go

Speaking of cross-device experiences, the Fall Creators Update comes with new features specifically designed for those who flip from one device to the next.

Microsoft introduced Timeline to help users jump back into what they were working on. It works by showing users a visual timeline of their desktop so they can get right back into the files, apps and sites they were accessing at the time. At a basic level, it’s a lot like MacOS’ Time Machine, but for revisiting your desktop state from an earlier time and place.

Beyond your PC, Cortana enables the same Pick Up Where You Left Off across a wider variety of Windows, iOS and Android devices. Microsoft gave the example of being able to work on a doc on the PC and Cortana asking a user whether they would like to finish it up on a phone.

Last but not least, Clipboard brings universal copy and paste to Windows devices and beyond. Aside from just clipping text and web links, Clipboard also allows users to transfer photos and animated GIFs from a Windows PC to their preferred mobile device.",techradar
10,HTC U 11 teaser points to serious audio skills,"While a pressure-sensitive frame is likely to be the highlight of the HTC U11 it’s seemingly not the only trick the phone will have up its sleeve, as a new teaser suggests you’ll be able to record sound in 360 degrees.

Posted on HTC’s official Twitter account, the teaser is a short, silent video of dirt bikes circling a person, and what appears to be a visual representation of sound waves coming from all directions.

Perhaps more telling than the content though, is the caption, which reads “360 real-life recording.”

It’s all still a bit vague, but recording presumably means either audio or video, and since the HTC U 11 is rumored to have fairly ordinary single-lens cameras on the front and back it’s unlikely that it will be able to shoot 360-degree videos.

360 real-life recording. 05.16.17 #BrilliantU pic.twitter.com/2lpipWCcZN11 May 2017

Immersive audio

Audio though is another matter altogether. HTC’s phones are often known for standout sound and there have already been rumors that the HTC U 11 will have 4 microphones, with the ability to record audio in 3D, for a surround sound effect, so we’d say this teaser is almost a confirmation of that.

Last year's HTC 10 had a similar power, and did certainly shoot brilliant 4K videos (among the best we'd seen on a phone in terms of a video and audio combo) but this could be a bigger step forward.

It might sound like a niche feature, but it has the potential to make videos far more immersive, particularly when recording scenes where sound is key, such as a concert – or, as in the teaser’s example, being circled by dirt bikes.

We’ll know for sure whether this is what HTC is teasing soon, as the HTC U 11 is being revealed on May 16.",techradar

10,"Google IO 2017: dates, schedule and rumors for Google's big developer conference","Update: Google rolled out new features for its Allo chat app in early May, namely incognito mode for groups, chat backup/restore and link preview. None of these are huge new additions, but it's a sign Google is actively updating Allo, and we'll likely hear much more about it at IO.

Google has also released its official IO 2017 app with new features such as early seat reservations. It's a handy tool for IO attendees, but the app also lets those who can't make it livestream the keynote and sessions on their phone or tablet.

Original article below...

Google IO, the search giant's annual developer conference, is almost here. Actually, let's try that again: Google is referring to this year's IO as an ""outdoor developer festival"", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and so much more.

The Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif.

The official Google IO 2017 schedule is also out now, letting attendees and those watching from home get a taste of what Google has cooking.

We're still digesting everything Google announced at IO 2016, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat , the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.

This year's event looks to be just as jam-packed, so if you're a developer interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop on over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited in order to register). Attending IO is no cheap trip: A general admission Google IO 2017 ticket costs $1,150 (about £930, AU$1,535).

While this ""festival"" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.

Google IO 2017 schedule

Google has announced a ton of talks for the Google IO 2017 schedule , and here's some great news if you're unable to attend in person: Every technical session, all 150+ of them, will be livestreamed.

The theme of this year's conference seems to be ""more,"" with even more sessions still to be announced, more space for developers, more Office Hours and more ways to connect with everything Google announces.

Google is also doing something different this year and hosting an hour-long Developer Keynote at 1pm PT on May 17, shortly after the main keynote wraps up. This will give developers a chance to gain deeper insight into how they can utilize everything Google just announced.

A few sessions to highlight from the current schedule are:

What's New in Android : 2pm - 3pm PT May 17. In what will likely be the most well-attended and widely watched session of IO, this session will go over what's new for developers when it comes to Android. This includes the Android O Developer Preview SDK, Support Libraries and what Google says will be ""other new and exciting developments."" Expect plenty of details on what Android O has to offer both developers and users.

Android Wear: What's new & Best Practices : 9:30am - 10:30am PT on May 18. This session will ""introduce new features of the next release of Android Wear,"" as well as go over the work that's already been done in Android Wear and best practices for making apps for the wearable operating system.

What's new for Android TV : 10:30am - 11:30am PT on May 18. Here, developers will learn all the latest on the Android TV front, including new APIs, features and future platform improvements.

Introduction to Android Instant Apps : 1:30pm - 2:30pm PT on May 18. In what will likely be a key theme of the show, this session will go over Instant Apps for developers, including how to build their own. While this may be too technical for regular users, it's a sign Google will devote plenty of time - and probably officially roll out - Instant Apps at the show. Here's more on why this is a good thing for users .

Google promises more talks are on the way, so we'll keep this page updated with anything that sounds interesting between now and May 17. To get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!

Say hello to Android O

The star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O come May.

While we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another public submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.

What will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case with Android O.

But what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.

One of the most exciting features of the early build is 'Background limits'. This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.

Android O also currently houses picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.

One final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth to your devices.

As Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, also look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.

What's the word on Android Wear 2?

Android Wear 2 launched in February, so while it's unlikely Google will announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.

For starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.

We wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2 apps are announced, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.

With Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.

ZTE Quartz review: The latest Android Wear 2 smartwatch

Google Home invasion

Google introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write ""Google"" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features made available to the original.

One of the more robust rumors is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.

Considering Google already has the Project Fi and Google Voice services, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which puts the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.

Another report, this time from early April , says Google is considering an updated Home smart speaker that doubles as a mesh Wi-Fi router.

The device would act as a personal assistant and internet router in one, and presumably like Google Wifi would need multiple units to create a mesh network.

A few points against updated hardware or major new features are that Google Home added one of its most requested features, multiple user support , in mid-April and the device just went on sale in the UK. Still, if Google is working to improve Google Home, chances are we'll see whatever is in store at IO.

Google Chrome improvement

Another area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and this could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.

The most likely developments we'll hear about are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.

There are also whispers spreading Google is preparing an ad-blocker built into Chrome. It's almost impossible ad revenue-dependent Google would block every ad on Chrome, so it's more likely Google will introduce a tool that filters out the most offending ads. Perhaps we'll meet this quasi-ad blocker at IO.

New Google Pixel phones? Perhaps

Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL are in the works.

It's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.

Not only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, and if a recent Google investment in LG Display is anything to go by, the new Pixel phones will have curved OLED screens.

Virtual reality, Chromecast and everything else

There's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we might see:

Like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2 headset, but we'll undoubtedly have news on the VR front from the Big G. These could include a headset price reduction, or updates related to how developers create and publish content for virtual reality.

With Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , as Google recently told us, we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.

On the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 . This would certainly make sense, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the IO cards.

Another possible topic are updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.

We could also be in for a new Chromecast as it's been some months since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale. At one time the best selling streaming video device, Google may look to recapture some of that old Chromecast magic with a new and improved device.

Google is also interested in getting Assistant into more devices. The search giant released a developer preview Google Assistant SDK in late April, letting anyone build the digital helper into any device they create. While many of these gadgets will be of the prototype variety, expect some commercial products to hit the market with Assistant in tow. We'll likely hear plenty more about this initiative during IO.

The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.

Google recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.

This is not to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January. And with video app Google Duo adding voice-only calling on April 10, the chat app waters have gotten even muddier.

(Image: © Google)

What is clear is that there are one too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps the Big G will finally drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.

This was in an effort to ""focus and prioritize"" on the features and apps Google deems most important, and could be just the start of a chat service spring cleaning we'll see the culmination of at IO.

Another likely announcement is the Allo desktop and/or web app, both of which have been teased by Google execs. Users are especially keen to get Allo on the desktop, and it's a good bet Google won't want to disappoint.",techradar
10,TCL eyes the throne as one of the world's top TV makers,"“It can be overwhelming to walk into a retailer and see all the TVs on the wall. All their settings are cranked up to compete with one another,” Chris Larson, Senior Vice President, TCL tells us at a recent briefing held at Dolby Labs in San Francisco, Calif.

The discussion was about how TCL TVs … well, all TVs really, are calibrated differently for stores than they are for your home. It’s a trick TV manufacturers have been using for years – turning saturation levels up to sickening levels while cranking the brightness up to its maximum level. It’s intense, definitely, and more than a little deceitful.

But let’s not focus on that god-awful practice for a minute. Let’s focus on the wall of TVs.

For anyone who knows the difference between a composite and component cable, this wall is a visual chocolate factory – each television offering a different flavor of eye candy. We love walking into a Best Buy or Tesco to see what’s new in the world of pixels and panels. We comment on how this LG OLED might look better than Samsung’s new QLED screen, at least in terms of contrast, and quibble over whether Android TV is the best or the worst thing to ever happen to televisions in the last century.

But for others, like my parents, this section of the store – and in particular this wall of TVs – is nothing but a bunch of seemingly identical screens. Who makes a better OLED really isn’t on their list of concerns. I’ve tried to explain Quantum Dot, Dolby Vision, HDR and dozens of other technologies over the years to my parents and, honestly, they’re not interested. As long as the TV looks good and doesn’t cost much, they’re happy.

If you want to know how TCL (an acronym that at one point stood for True China Lion) became the third largest TV manufacturer in the world, it’s through people like my parents.

Quality, performance and value

Sorry, that last bit makes it sound like TCL doesn’t make very good TVs. They do. I mean, they’re not exceptional in the same way the LG Signature Series W7 OLED or the Samsung Q9F QLED TV are, but they’re quite good – especially now that they support Dolby Vision.

The reason for my visit to Dolby Labs was to check out TCL’s 2017 line-up. Two series from last year are getting a refresh (the P- and S-Series) while TCL is introducing a completely new line called the C-Series that taps into contemporary aesthetics and adds support for most HDR sources.

These TVs look good and, according to Larson, will also be priced fairly. If you’re looking for a way to help differentiate TCL from the masses of TVs on the aforementioned wall, it’s their brand promise: Delivering uncompromised experiences at a recognized value with an attractive cosmetic.

It’s a promise that seems to be harder and harder to keep every year now that new Chinese TV makers like Hisense and LeEco have moved into the market. To me, this seems like something worth fretting over, but it didn’t seem to scare anyone in that office.

Oprah might give away cars, but Ellen's got TVs covered.

Larsen told me there were already branding programs in place to help make TCL a household name. “We have a partnership with the Ellen Show and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Plus, we acquired the TCL Chinese Theater down in L.A.” Other ties include UCLA athletic teams, the San Jose Earthquakes (a MLS team based in Northern California) and the Rose Bowl, one of the biggest football games in the NCAA.

And while the list is impressive, I’m not sure a few sponsorship deals will be enough to beat out the most ubiquitous names in television like Sony, Samsung and LG – each of whom have a long and storied career in American families’ living rooms. But maybe it will be.

The grand plan

So what’s the end goal here? If TCL got this far in the TV world without an insane amount of brand recognition, why does it want to change anything?

According to Larsen, it's easy to sell smaller value TVs. It’s a crowded market, sure, but in the end value always beats out performance. But being the main screen in the house? That’s much, much harder. To get to the coveted center of the home you’ve not only got to look good in terms of picture quality and cost less than everyone else, but you need a decent design aesthetic, too.

And according to Aaron Dew, Director of Product Development at TCL, that’s where this year’s all new C-Series come in.

The new series will go on sale in late June and combines “contemporary design” (Dew’s words) and the latest in 4K HDR technology. As far as operating systems go, the TVs use Roku OS 7.5 – a close relative of the operating system used on Roku streaming boxes like the Roku Ultra, Roku Premiere+ and Roku Express.

The C-Series will come in 55-, 65- and 75-inch versions and will include both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. (HLG is something TCL is looking into, but not actively including on any TV this year.) They'll feature wide color gamut with advanced LED phosphor for more realistic colors, brighter highlights and increased light-to-dark contrast and support almost 100% of the DCI-P3 color space.

I left the demo impressed with what I saw. The Dolby Vision integration helped add some pizzazz to TCL’s panels, while Roku OS provided a familiar face that I knew could help me find the content I’ve been looking for.

And yet, I couldn’t help but think back to that wall.

When TCL’s latest series make it to showrooms in late June, will my parents be blown away by Dolby Vision? Will they care that the 2017 P-Series now has 72 Contrast Control Zones that increase contrast and clarity? Maybe. Maybe not.

But considering that TCL’s 55-inch C-Series TV, the 55C807, goes for $699 (around £540, AU$950), I guess it doesn’t matter.",techradar

As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday. (Photo: MariuszBlach, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

LONDON — As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300 per computer, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday.

The infections have disabled more than a dozen hospitals in the United Kingdom, Spain's largest telecom company and universities in Italy as well as some FedEx computers. Ransomware encrypts the files on a computer or network demanding that payment be made in Bitcoin or another untraceable digital currency before the criminals will unlock the files.

Infected computers showed a screen giving the user three days to pay the ransom. After that, the price would be doubled. After seven days the files would be deleted, it threatened.

In Spain, the largest telecommunications company reportedly would have had to pay close to $550,000 to unlock all the encrypted computers hit on its network.

The ransomware code is named WanaCrypt and has been in use by criminals since at least February. It is available in at least 28 languages, including Bulgarian and Vietnamese, according to Avast, a Czech security company that is following the fast-moving attack.

However, a new variant dubbed WannaCry was created that makes use of a vulnerability in the Windows operating system that was patched by Microsoft on March 14. Computers that have not installed the patch are potentially vulnerable to the malicious code, according to a Kaspersky Lab blog post on Friday.

First appearance early Friday

The attack seems to have first appeared around 2 am ET on Friday in Europe, said Kurt Baumgartner, a principal security researcher with Kaspersky Lab in Moscow.

""It's very well-written code and there is no easy way to crack the encrypted files once they're infected,"" he said.

The ransomware is believed to be linked to an exploit, which is computer code that takes advantage of a computer vulnerability, known to have been used by the Equation Group, which many in the security world believe is connected to the National Security Agency (NSA).

That exploit was one of many hacking tools stolen from the NSA and later published online by a group that called itself the Shadow Brokers, according to Avast. That group has been leaking pieces of more than a gigabyte worth of older NSA software weapons since August.

Avast has recorded over 50,000 attacks globally as of Friday afternoon. The majority are targeted at Russia, the Ukraine and Taiwan but have also hit multiple other countries. Russia’s Interior Ministry said Friday it had come under cyberattack.

Perpetrators unknown

Exactly who is behind the attack is unknown.

Kasperksy's Baumgartner did note that although the ransomware was able to offer ""how to pay"" documents in dozens of languages, the only language whose writing was perfect was Russian, with the others showing distinct signs that a non-native speaker had written them. ""The English is very good, but there are a couple of quirks that would lead me to believe it wasn't written by a native English speaker,"" he said.

Also unknown is whether there are multiple coordinated attacks underway. It's also possible that the code was released once and is now working its way around the globe.

It's moving so quickly in part because the exploit it's based on may allow it to because of a so-called ""spreader"" element it contains that allows it to spread quickly.

While the full code hasn't yet been studied it's possible that each computer network would only need to be infected once via a phishing attack, when a user unwittingly opened an email or clicked a link containing the ransomware malicious code.

That code might then be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the computer’s code to spread across any network it was a part of, said Philip Reitinger, president of the non-profit Global Cyber Alliance.

Sometimes called a “wormable” vulnerability, it is considered very serious because of the speed at which worms can infect and jump from system to system, he said.

Services in London, the central city of Nottingham, and the counties of Hertfordshire and Cumbria were affected, according to the BBC. The National Health Service (NHS) said 16 of its organizations reported they were victims.

The hackers behind the ransomware attack were demanding $300 worth of the online currency Bitcoin to release files from encryption, the Mirror and Telegraph reported.

No evidence 'patient data has been accessed'

In a statement, the NHS said: ""A number of NHS organizations have reported to NHS Digital that they have been affected by a ransomware attack which is affecting a number of different organizations. The investigation is at an early stage but we believe the malware variant is Wanna Decryptor.""

""At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected organizations to confirm this.""

The NHS said the attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and was affecting other organizations. It said it was working to resolve the problem.

Hackers behind the Wanna Decryptor virus, a type of malware, often ask users for money to retrieve access to files they have encrypted.

NHS Merseyside, which operates a number of hospitals in northwestern England, tweeted, “we are taking all precautionary measures possible to protect our local NHS systems and services.” The NHS Merseyside website was down Friday afternoon local time.

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which runs four hospitals north of London, said in a statement: ""Immediately on discovery of the problem, the trust acted to protect its IT systems by shutting them down; it also meant that the trust’s telephone system is not able to accept incoming calls.”

It said it was postponing all non-urgent work and asked people not to come to the accident and emergency unit.

Doctors at some surgeries were forced to use pen and paper to record patient details following the attack.

John Caldwell, a doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian he had “no access to record systems or results.""

Chris Mimnagh, another doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian: “Unable to access our clinical system – as a precaution our area has severed links to the wider NHS, which means no access to our national systems, no computers means no records, no prescriptions, no results. We are dealing with urgent problems only. Our patients are being very understanding so far.”

NHS Million, a campaign which supports NHS staff and is separate from the NHS, tweeted: ""We just don't understand the mentality of some people. The only people suffering are people that need emergency care. #nhscyberattack""

6,"As Trump implies there are 'tapes' of talks with Comey, Sean Spicer refuses to answer","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As we continue to follow the developments of FBI Director James Comey’s firing, President Donald Trump continues to add fuel to the fire. Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60

White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to confirm or deny whether President Trump tapes his phone calls or conversations with others – including inside the Oval Office.

The startling non-denial at the White House press briefing came just hours after Trump, in what appeared to be a threat to his fired FBI director Friday morning, implied there may be recordings of his conversations with James Comey. ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Spicer dodged multiple questions from reporters about whether Trump makes a habit of recording conversations or whether there were recording devices in the room during the meeting with Comey.

""He simply stated the fact. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said. ""There's nothing further to add on that.""

Trump's early morning tweet that set off this firestorm was a clear indication of his defensiveness as the fallout continues from this week's abrupt and controversial firing of Comey, the man who was overseeing an ongoing FBI investigation into whether Trump's campaign associates colluded with Russians seeking to influence the American presidential election.

Yet Trump's tweet this morning was not actually meant as a warning to Comey not to speak to the media, Spicer said. ""That’s not a threat. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As the Trump administration continues to stand by the decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer says the administration continues to fight the 'false narrative' of Trump administration ties with Russia. (May 12) AP

At issue here are the differing accounts of the discussions Trump had with Comey over the FBI's Russia investigation.

In his short termination letter to Comey on Tuesday, Trump made a specific point of mentioning that he ""appreciated"" how the FBI told him three times he was not personally under investigation in the counterintelligence probe. He later elaborated, in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, that those conversations took place twice in phone calls and once at a private dinner with the FBI director.

FBI officials have questioned Trump's claims, and the agency's acting director, Andrew McCabe, on Thursday said such assurances about the scope of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation would not be ""standard practice.''

Also, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, cast serious doubt on Trump's claim that Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

Clapper said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.'' In an interview on MSNBC on Friday, Clapper said: ""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI.""

Trump, on the other hand, told NBC a day earlier that Comey had requested the dinner to ask to keep his job after the election. FBI directors, by law, serve 10 year terms; Comey had six more years left.

Since the other assurances Trump mentioned apparently took place by phone, some analysts wondered if Trump's reference to ""tapes"" referred to wiretapping.

In a letter sent to the White House, House Democratic leaders called for the release of any tapes and recorded communications between Trump and Comey. Trump’s early Friday warning even of the prospect of “tapes,"" they said, “raised the specter of possible intimidation and obstruction of justice.’’

""Under normal circumstances, we would not consider credible any claims that the White House may have taped conversations of meetings with the president,"" Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the Judiciary Committee’s ranking Democrat, and Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in a letter to White House Counsel Donald McGahn. ""However, because of the many false statements made by White House officials this week, we are compelled to ask whether any such recordings do in fact exist. If so, we request copies of all recordings in possession of the White House regarding this matter.""

Wikileaks also offered $100,000 to anyone who would leak tapes of Trump and Comey's communications.

Some analysts say Trump might not be the only one to be keeping track of conversations. Comey, they said, might have his own written records of his discussions with Trump.

Historian Michael Beschloss tweeted: ""Have to presume that Comey kept some kind of record of any conversation he had with the President.""

And Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice during the Obama administration, tweeted: ""One thing I learned at DOJ about Comey: he leaves a protective paper trail whenever he deems something inappropriate happened. Stay tuned.""

Giving more details about the discussions at Friday's briefing, Spicer said Trump was seeking assurances from the FBI director that he wasn't under investigation because he wanted to fight back against ""the narrative"" building around the Russia story.​

Disputing the basis of the Russia investigation, Spicer said, ""There's no collusion that occurred."" In fact, Trump wants investigators to get to the bottom of Russian involvement in the election, Spicer said, so as to debunk the ""false narrative"" that the Trump campaign was somehow involved.

In the Friday briefing, Spicer also denied reports that Trump solicited a loyalty pledge from Comey during their dinner earlier this year.

A New York Times report – one that may have inspired one of Friday's tweets — said Trump asked the FBI director to pledge personal loyalty to him during their dinner. ""Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge,"" the Times reported. ""Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not 'reliable' in the conventional political sense.""

Spicer's briefing began with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster discussing the president's upcoming trip to the Middle East and Europe, despite threats from President Trump earlier in the day threatening to cancel press briefings because he was unhappy with the media coverage of Comey's dismissal.

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

In a striking reversal one day earlier, Trump told NBC News that he planned to fire Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance. ""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"" who led the agency into turmoil.

He also specifically brought up the ongoing Russia investigation. ""In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself – I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC. ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""

These reasons contradicted the White House's assertions — and even the widely disseminated termination letter Trump sent Comey — that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who criticized Comey's handling of the email investigation into Hillary Clinton last year.

Spicer called the coverage of changing stories behind Comey's dismissal miss the point.

""It's always the president's decision,"" Spicer said.

He did not dispute Trump's suggestion that press briefings should be canceled, saying only, ""I think he's a little dismayed"" by the media coverage.

Trump reiterated the idea of canceling briefings in a separate interview with Fox's Jeanine Pirro. Calling them ""press conferences,"" he characterized the briefings as having ""a level of hostility that’s incredible and it’s very unfair.""

The White House Correspondents Association objected to Trump's threat. Shutting down news briefings, the association said in a statement, ""would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned.""

Former NFL receiver Michael Jackson was killed early Friday morning in a motorcycle accident just outside of Tangipahoa, La.

Jackson, 48, played for the Cleveland Browns from 1991-95 and the Baltimore Ravens from 1996-98.

Jackson's motorcycle slammed into the driver's side door of a car driven by Destiny Gordon of Kentwood, La., killing both.

According to a news release from the Louisiana State Police, ""(Jackson) was riding a 2013 Kawasaki motorcycle northbound on US 51 at a high rate of speed. Gordon was driving a 2014 Chevrolet Malibu. As Gordon was backing from a parking space, she backed across both lanes of US 51 into the path of (Jackson’s) motorcycle. The motorcycle crashed into the driver’s side door of the Malibu.""

The report said that Jackson was wearing a helmet and Gordon was properly restrained in the car.

Michael Jackson was more than a great player, he was a great man.

Jackson was drafted by the Browns out of Southern Mississippi, where his quarterback was Brett Favre. In three of his seasons in Cleveland, he played for Bill Belichick. After five years in Cleveland, he finished with 2,797 receiving yards and 28 touchdowns. His breakout season was 1996 with the Ravens -- their first year in Baltimore after the move from Cleveland -- when he was sixth in the league in receiving yards (1,201) and was tied for the lead in touchdown receptions with 14.

CBS beefed up its 2017-18 primetime slate Friday, adding four new dramas and two new comedies. The network had previously announced a third comedy, Young Sheldon, a prequel spinoff of hit sitcom The Big Bang Theory.

The new shows will feature many familiar faces, including Alan Cumming (The Good Wife), David Boreanaz (Bones), Shemar Moore (Criminal Minds), Bobby Moynihan (Saturday Night Live) and Mark Feuerstein (Royal Pains).

MORE: TV cancellation watch

The new dramas are:

• Instinct. A professor (Cumming) is lured back into the world of his past life as a CIA operative when New York police need his help catching a serial killer. The series is based on an upcoming book by best-selling author James Patterson and stars Cumming, Naveen Andrews (Lost) and Khandi Alexander (Scandal).

• SEAL Team. Navy SEALs are the focus of this drama, which follows the professional and personal lives of members of an elite team assigned to the most dangerous missions on behalf of the country. The cast includes Boreanaz, Max Thieriot (Bates Motel) and Jessica Paré (Mad Men).

• S.W.A.T. A familiar title from a 1970s TV series and 2003 film re-emerges in this drama that follows a Los Angeles-born S.W.A.T. sergeant who is ""torn between loyalty to the streets and duty to his fellow (L.A.) officers"" when he's assigned to run a specialized tactical unit. Criminal Minds' Moore stars, along with Stephanie Sigman (Narcos), Jay Harrington (Better Off Ted) and Kenny Johnson (The Shield).

• Wisdom of the Crowd. A visionary tech innovator (Jeremy Piven, Mr. Selfridge) creates a crowd-sourcing app to call on millions of minds to help solve his daughter’s murder. Series also stars Richard T. Jones (Judging Amy) and Monica Potter (Parenthood).

'9JKL' is based on star/producer Mark Feuerstein's years spent living in an apartment between his parents (Elliott Gould and Linda Lavin) and brother and sister-in-law. (Photo: Cliff Lipson, CBS)

The comedies include:

• 9JKL. This family comedy, to be filmed in front of a studio audience, is based on a time in star and executive producer Feuerstein's life when he lived in an apartment between his parents on one side and his brother, sister-in-law and their baby on the other side. Intrusion is the rule. Linda Lavin (Alice) and Elliot Gould (Ray Donovan) also star.

• Me, Myself & I.

WASHINGTON – The nation's former top intelligence official Friday cast serious doubt on President Trump's claim that now-fired FBI Director James Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.''

""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI,'' Clapper said in an interview on MSNBC.

Clapper, a highly-regarded figure during his long service in government, is the latest in a growing number of former and current government officials who have rushed to defend Comey, abruptly dismissed Tuesday. For his own part, Clapper also renounced Trump's assertions that he had had offered an independent finding earlier this week that there was no collusion between Trump associates and the Russian government.

Trump's explosive claim about Comey came in a Thursday interview with NBC News when he said the director had requested the dinner to express his desire to continue his tenure at the FBI. That would have been an unusual request, since he was in the fourth year of a 10-year term.

But Clapper flatly dismissed Trump's account. According to Comey, the dinner invitation had been extended by Trump, Clapper said. He also said that Trump's claim that Comey sought the meeting to keep his job was completely out of character for the former director.

""I can't imagine him doing that,'' Clapper said in the interview.

In an early Friday flurry of tweets, Trump appeared to threaten Comey from offering a version of the dinner that contradicted the president's, raising the prospect that their meeting had been secretly recorded.

""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations,'' the president said in a tweet.

Yet one person close to Comey, who was not authorized to comment publicly, flatly dismissed the president's version as not accurate.

Clapper also rejected Trump's assertion that Comey's ouster was necessary because of long-standing ""turmoil'' within the bureau. The former intelligence chief said he regularly interacted with other FBI officials who offered no such assessments.

""From my vantage point, the morale at the FBI was very high,'' Clapper said.

Earlier this week, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told a Senate panel that Comey maintained ""broad support'' within the bureau.

Clapper's unflinching support of Comey came as Trump, in a separate Friday tweet, referred to the former national intelligence director's testimony to a Senate panel earlier this week. Trump said Clapper had publicly insisted there was no collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

However, that's not the full story. Clapper told lawmakers that the intelligence community’s report on Russian hacking, which he oversaw, did not include any evidence of collusion. But Clapper also added that he was unaware of the ongoing FBI investigation until Comey disclosed it publicly in March.

""I don't know if there was collusion or not,'' Clapper said Friday in the MSNBC interview.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer appeared to dismiss the implications of Clapper's stated lack of knowledge about the ongoing inquiry and his inability to provide a definitive assessment of Russian collusion. ""It sounds like the story has changed,"" Spicer said.

WASHINGTON – An interim FBI director could be named as soon as Friday, Justice Department officials said.

Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said that acting director Andrew McCabe, who was appointed following Tuesday's abrupt firing of Director James Comey, would remain as deputy director if he was not chosen as the new interim chief.

In addition to McCabe, Flores said that Justice officials were reviewing four candidates, including three current FBI division chiefs. They are:

Adam Lee , chief of the FBI’s Richmond, Va., office. Prior to that, Lee oversaw the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section at FBI Headquarters in Washington. In that role, Lee led the bureau’s investigations of elected and appointed government officials and civil rights violations.

Justice officials have said that the interim appointee could also be considered as an official nominee to succeed Comey, who was dismissed just four years into his 10-year term.

Meanwhile, the White House earlier this week said Trump is considering ""several individuals"" to replace Comey.

While they wouldn't discuss potential candidates to replace James Comey permanently, attention was focused on at least seven candidates, which in addition to McCabe include: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Milwaukee County Sheriff Dave Clarke; South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy; former New York police commissioner Ray Kelly; former FBI agent and former Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Rogers, and John Pistole, a former deputy FBI director and Transportation Security Administration director.

16,"Mom loses job at 75, son shows her life she never had","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share When Rebecca lost her job at 75, her son decided it was time for her to live her dreams. Sian-Pierre Regis wanted to help her live her best life, so they set off on a bucket list trip together. HUMANKIND

BOSTON — Sian-Pierre Regis was in Paris when his mother left him a voicemail that he will never forget: “I just got fired, just want you to know that. Call me. Bye.”

His 75-year-old housekeeper mother, Rebecca Danigelis, had been working in hospitality for as long as Regis could remember.

“We were raised above a hotel,” Regis says. Danigelis raised two boys by herself in Boston, over the hotel where she worked.

“I was always very aware of the fact that everything she made went into our mouths,” Regis remembers about his childhood with his brother. She cashed out her 401k to help Regis go to college. He went on to live his dreams, while hers were set aside.

Then she got fired.

Regis decided it was time for his mother to live her dreams. He wanted to help her live her best life, and he wanted them to do it together.

The bucket list

Danigelis had been working on a bucket list of things she’s always wanted to do. “When she got fired,” says Regis, “all these bucket list items took on so much more weight.”

She added a few more items to the list and together they set off to live her dreams.

“There is a spirt within her that I’ve never seen so bright.” Sian-Pierre Regis

Some of the things on her list were pure fun: Take a hip-hop lesson with a dancer from the award-winning Broadway musical Hamilton, join Instagram, milk a cow in Vermont, take a mystery trip.

But some of her bucket list items were deeper and more meaningful to her, like visiting the grave of her sister in England.

Danigelis missed her sister’s funeral because she was working. She couldn’t find someone to cover her shift, so she didn’t attend. Standing over her sister’s grave, she sobbed, saying, “I wish I had come sooner.”

“I could see all the memories of she and her sister flooding towards her, she just felt horrible,” Regis says.

No regrets

Regis says his mother has been reflective about missing out on so many things in her life, but she says she would never change any of it. “She had to put food on the table,” he said. And her boys always were her priority.

As mother and son toured the world, ticking off her bucket list items, the duo has shared many laughs.

“There is a spirit within her that I’ve never seen so bright, she’s 75 but I’ve never seen her younger than in these moments,” Regis says.

Next chapter

This dynamic duo isn’t done with mom’s bucket list. Danigelis has yet to skydive or walk the Boston Marathon route, something she plans on doing with both her sons. She is actively looking for a job in hospitality, but says she is having trouble finding an employer who is seeking someone her age.

Regis has filmed their adventure since the beginning, hoping to share his mother’s struggle with the world, but also give her something she can cherish forever. “She’s always wanted to write a memoir,” Regis says. “So many people in their day-to-day jobs render that dream impossible, but now through this film, she’s able to tell her story and be in control of this story.”

They will continue completing items on mom’s bucket list through the end of 2017. Regis has launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for production costs for his mother's film, which they've titled Duty Free.

In the meantime, follow her adventures on Instagram and Facebook. And if you see Danigelis painting a picture of her neighborhood in Boston’s Back Bay, know that she’s fulfilling another one of her dreams.

9,Cubs dispute report they mistreated superfan Ronnie Woo Woo,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In light of Mother's Day, we asked baseball legend Ken Griffey Jr. about his mother, and he shared an unforgettable childhood memory. USA TODAY Sports

The Chicago Sun-Times ran a cover story featuring Cubs superfan Ronnie “Woo Woo” Wickers, who claimed he was mistreated and targeted by security at Wrigley Field.

The defending World Series champion organization — holding firm that its reasoning for dismissing Wickers was based on no proof of a ticket — jabbed back on its official Twitter account. “Anyone else you want us to let in without a ticket?” the Cubs' account tweeted in response to the Sun-Times’ Friday cover picture of Wickers.

@Suntimes Anyone else you want us to let in without a ticket? — Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) May 12, 2017

Wickers is one of the most recognizable Cubs fans — he has sung for the 7th inning stretch and was the subject of a fandom documentary, “WooLife”. But he was removed by security from an April 19 game when he couldn’t produce his ticket. The Cubs claimed that Wickers had previously tried to enter the game without a ticket, prompting his ultimate removal.

Cubs spokesperson Julian Green told USA TODAY Sports: ""Throughout the years, Ronnie Wickers has attempted to enter Wrigley Field without a ticket, and he is politely turned away by staff. Wickers, like any other fan or celebrity, must have a ticket to attend a game at Wrigley Field. No exceptions.

""We take ticket integrity seriously, so if you attempt to enter a section in the first or seventh inning, you must produce a ticket when asked. We find it odd that Mr. Wickers is claiming some act of discrimination when he has attended several games since April 19 and received the same courtesy we would provide to all our guests.""

Green added that Wickers’ friend, Scott Miller, refused to show officials an e-ticket for Wickers and himself.

""(Miller) refused and verbally assaulted three members of our guest service staff, including a supervisor, which is a violation of our code of conduct,"" Green said. ""Cursing at our staff will get you and your guests a one-way ticket out of the ballpark, so Mr. Miller should proceed with caution if attending a future game.""

The 75-year-old Wickers, however, believes he was mistreated.

“They just lied about everything. I’m going to fight this with my last breath. I would like to sit down with Mr. Tom Ricketts for 10 minutes and let him roll back the videotape,” Wickers told the Sun-Times.

""This is simple,"" Green, the Cubs spokesman, said. ""Buy a ticket, politely show it when asked and enjoy a great day at the ballpark.""",usa-today

4,Here’s What Indigenous Cultural Appropriation Is And Why Canada Needs To Stop Doing It,"Everything about this is a mess.

2017 also happens to mark the 150th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada. Which is why this mas band thought it was a good idea to ""celebrate"" with this. A Carnival band has designed Indigenous costumes to celebrate Canada's 150th. A CityNews viewer says it's offensive… https://t.co/4YLq7ZVfLQ

Toronto-based mas band Carnival Nationz previewed two of their designs called, ""Oh Kanata"" and ""One Nationz"" ahead of the annual Toronto Caribbean Carnival. Both designs featured headgear styled in reference to sacred Indigenous headdresses.

And there were a lot of feelings. Even about the way CityNews Toronto chose to word their tweet. @CityNews Indigenous ""costumes"" are actually called regalia and portraying Native traditional wear as a costume can… https://t.co/aa0WiGNqut

@CityNews I am proud of my Caribbean culture. However on this, members of Indigenous community should have been engaged.

@CityNews Why are you even asking?

Now, if you're not quite sure ~why~ this is a bad thing, we'll break it down for you. Not only did Carnival Nationz get accused of appropriating Indigenous culture; people were pretty pissed that it was meant to be a celebration of Canada's 150th birthday.

Which Indigenous peoples have some... varying opinions on. @IPSMO1 Ottawa 2017: 150 Years of Genocide #canada150 #decolonize

Although some Indigenous peoples in Canada boycott the celebration of Canada Day, many are doing so especially this year for Canada's 150th birthday. Many believe the increased call for celebration is a means of distraction from contemporary Indigenous issues, as well as Canada's history with Indigenous peoples. In short, it feels like a celebration of colonization and genocide. So, ""honouring"" First Nations with cultural appropriation for Canada Day? Triple no.

Yikes. Cultural appropriation is also especially bad when it's supposed to be sexy. Nah @CNzInc, you guys screwed this one up. You don't get to steal the culture of Indigenous Canadians and claim it'… https://t.co/539uJzqoRK

Some thought it was a positive display of ""cultural appreciation."" Carnival Nationz wins this year. Really pulled through with some beautiful costumes. Thank god.

The Facebook post was originally shared over 2,500 times and commented on over 2,000 times in 24 hours. View this post on Facebook facebook.com

Now, this is what mas band costumes usually look like. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

And this is what female powwow dancers at Gathering of Nations looked like. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

Just to clarify, this is okay. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

And this is okay, too. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

This, on the other hand, is questionable. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

The mas band's costumes brought up the discussion of headdresses, too. Also can we please acknowledge that Indigenous ppls have multiple cultures, and that this particular style of headdress is specific?

Recently, a teen apologized for cultural appropriating a headdress at Coachella. Welp, weekend 2 of #Coachella2017 had at least a few headdress offenders. I can't believe we're still dealing w/thi… https://t.co/aSLJ0NmN8O

Not only is the headdress considered a sacred object, it's also commonly viewed as "" pan-Indigenous "" (a term referring to the misconception/stereotype that all Indigenous people dress the same, look the same, etc.). View this photo on Instagram instagram.com That's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and National Chief Perry Bellegarde of the Assembly of First Nations.

Many chiefs reserve wearing of the headdress for special occasions and ceremonial purposes. (A.K.A. Not Coachella)

It is something to be treated with respect. This is Chief Red Cloud's warbonnet. This is who & what we rep. Honor the ancestors.

Native people culturally appropriate, too. First Nations Chicago Blackhawks fan wears fake headdress to a game and confuses everyone: http://t.co/uofAok6IHX In 2015, a man named Rob Bear stirred controversy after he was shown on-air wearing a headdress and drinking beer. He was reportedly approached at the Winnipeg Jets vs Chicago Blackhawks game but refused to take the headdress off.

The maelstrom that followed prompted the owners of the Winnipeg Jets to ban fake headdresses from their games . But cultural appropriation goes beyond headdresses.

While many people believe the past Miss Universe Canada and Carnival Nationz' costumes honour the first peoples of Canada, some are still pretty heated over the outright ""sexualization"" of First Nations culture. Chief calls for feathered bonnet and First Nations-inspired costumes to be pulled from Toronto Caribbean Carnival https://t.co/uRgHArOC39

In a statement on Facebook , Carnival Nationz apologized for the costumes. But, they didn’t say whether they’d still be worn to the carnival. View this post on Facebook Facebook: carnivalnationz

This all comes less than a month after a non-Indigenous Toronto artist was called-out for cultural appropriation of Native artwork. For anyone trying to decide whether Amanda PL is ""influenced"" or straight up copying NM. I offer this side by side… https://t.co/2dEwTTZlyV

The Canadian artist, known as Amanda PL, claimed to be ""inspired"" by the work of renowned Anishinaabe artist Norval Morrisseau. But people were quick to call the art out for being a ""rip-off.""

@AylanX Not content on just ripping off Morriseau #AmandaPL also plagiarized Corey Bulpitt & Larissa Healey

She signs her name in fucking syllabics, y'all. Don't give me your ""be niece to this well intentioned White Girl"" b… https://t.co/IRYJSinrpT

Amanda PL isn't the first non-Indigenous Canadian artist to be accused of plagiarism. Beautiful. Our Home and Native Land by Canadian female artist Jennifer Adomeit #cdnpoli #canada150 #cdngov #CAN2017… https://t.co/ijFQtqxoBk This piece, by Jennifer Adomeit, is being sold on Etsy for a whopping $200. That's some expensive cultural appropriation.

Sometimes, cultural appropriation is more subtle. For instance, in 2013, award-winning playwright Colleen Murphy came under fire for her play ""Pig Girl."" why would anyone EVER think a play titled ""Pig Girl"" telling the story of Robert Pickton is a good idea? http://t.co/wFZuMQMubj Yeah. Pig Girl is about Robert Pickton, considered one of the worst serial killers in Canadian history, who murdered women at his pig farm in BC. More specifically, the four-character play focuses on Pickton's victims and, by extension, on missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. The play went on to win a Governor General award. But many people, including the family members of one of Pickton's victims, were not so quick to praise the performance. Mainly, because a white woman felt it was her place to tell the tragic story.

And sometimes, cultural appropriation is just a slap in the face. School stands by decision to invite two white performers in headdresses to tell Indigenous stories https://t.co/apld01cFUf The Fort Nelson Secondary School recently stirred controversy after sharing photos to their Facebook page (which appear to have since been deleted) of white performers dressed up as... I don't really know what we call this. But it's a kick in the balls, especially considering ""real"" Indigenous people from the nearby Fort Nelson First Nation were never asked to present. Maybe because they don't have ""costumes.""

Whether in the form of plagiarism, sexualization, or outright just being an asshole, cultural appropriation is still a Canadian phenomenon in 2017. Instead of worrying about an apology or deleting evidence from social media, why don't we just stop doing it.",buzzfeed

4,'Snatched' Is Proof That The White-Women-Behaving-Badly Comedy Needs To Take A Break,"Emily Middleton, the thirtysomething New Yorker that Amy Schumer plays in Snatched, is a gross miscalculation of a character. But that realization takes a while to settle in. From afar, Emily looks like she might be a variation on the comedic persona Schumer has honed and weaponized in her standup and on her TV series, Inside Amy Schumer. You know the type — the Schumerian hot mess, the one who shuts the bar down, who’s unruffled to find herself waking up next to a stranger, who’s ditzy and lazy, and who parties and selfies as hard as she can to escape her feelings of inadequacy.

When Emily describes her plans for her upcoming Ecuadorian vacation to someone, they consist of how she hopes to transition from poolside cocktails in the day to red wine and then scotch at night. But after she’s divested of her retail job and her musician boyfriend (a welcome cameo from Randall Park) in quick succession, she’s left with no one to take with her on the nonrefundable trip. No one, that is, except for her divorced, anxiety-ridden mother, Linda (Goldie Hawn, making a questionable choice for her first role in 15 years), a necessity the film treats as deeply embarrassing. And so the two women travel to a resort, and soon find themselves kidnapped and held for ransom, then figure out a way to flee their captors and end up getting lost in the Amazon. It’s a misadventure in which Hawn acquits herself better as the neurotic straight woman than Schumer does as, basically, an asshole. Snatched, which is directed by 50/50’s Jonathan Levine and written by Katie Dippold (of The Heat, Ghostbusters, and this legendary tweet), is a talent-packed, terrifically unfunny movie that, more than anything else, underscores just how difficult it is to translate Schumer’s sharp-elbowed stylings to the conventions of a movie.

This was a challenge for her first big-screen leading role in Trainwreck, too, a better film that reveled in her character’s sloppy, standards-defying splendor only to then “solve” her with monogamy and sobriety. Snatched does much worse by having Emily let it all hang out without a hint of the savage self-awareness or sly feminism with which Schumer, not always perfectly, infused her show. Emily is Schumer’s vapid white girl schtick shorn of any of the underlying commentary, the movie treating her terribleness as endearing, right on through the two people she accidentally murders (lol!). That Snatched plays those incidents for uncertain laughs is an indication of how unsure it is of who it’s making fun of. It makes a joke about Linda’s xenophobic fears by having her mishear a “welcome” cocktail as being full of “whale cum” and react in horror, but it also affirms them by having her and her daughter abducted by a group of glowering South American stereotypes who prey on female tourists. Their leader, the crime lord Morgado (Óscar Jaenada), lambasts the Americans who come to his country only to stay in the resorts, but Snatched presents itself as one big warning against leaving those luxury confines. It’s on a day trip in the company of a suave but possibly sinister Brit (Tom Bateman) that the women get grabbed, and in their subsequent escape, they trek miles through the wilderness, get infected with tapeworms, and almost fall off a cliff. Meanwhile, Ike Barinholtz, as Emily’s agoraphobic brother, tries to annoy the State Department into helping out, and Wanda Sykes and Joan Cusack get underused as a pair of platonic (they insist) fellow vacationers with a particular set of skills. More than anything else, Snatched feels like an exhausted dead end for a type of comedy that Schumer and Lena Dunham, in particular, became famous for in the last decade — a comedy that consists of pitilessly self-lacerating white-women-behaving-badly scenarios that leans into its characters’ uglier tendencies while also inquiring into the standards by which those characters get judged.",buzzfeed

4,When Only Memories Can Fill The Cracks,"When I was a teenager, I drew the floor plan of my house a lot. It helped me tell stories about my family, where it was important to understand the view I had from my bedroom, or that there was a dividing half-wall between the kitchen and the living room in an otherwise open concept house. I’d draw lines to illustrate the trajectory of our tiny dog, who’d ricochet against the fridge, scramble down the hallway, bank off the doorframe into my parents’ bedroom, and steal a pair of socks. If I adjusted the scale of my drawing, I could show how close the house was to a nearby conservation area, and to the river beside where I’d sneak cigarettes and spray myself with CK One perfume before returning home, as though my mother wasn’t wise to the fact that the wooded areas of Guelph don’t smell like department store fragrance. My parents sold that house last fall, and moved into my mother’s childhood home — Nonna’s house, to me. Nonna is still alive, but her dementia means she’s been relocated to a retirement community, leaving her house empty. It wasn’t an easy process: My parents, looking to downsize, hadn’t found anything suitable after two years of looking. And Nonna, fiercely independent and living alone since the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier, wasn’t ready to let the house leave the family. She might not have ever moved were it not for the dementia, which, as a byproduct of its gradual erasure of Nonna’s memory, had made it dangerous for her to live alone. Once my parents bought the house, they began the physically necessary but emotionally taxing work of making it their own: a full reno, new appliances, new furniture. In addition to Nonna herself, most of the stuff that reminded me of her — the baby-blue shag carpet, the just-for-show purple towels in the upstairs bathroom, the Jesus portrait hanging above the staircase — is gone too. Nonna, for most of my life, would spend hours in conversation with me — in person at her house in Guelph, then over the phone once I moved to Toronto. Last time I saw her, she remembered me as her “granddaughter,” and that took 30 minutes. Nonna is physically recognizable to me, but the version of her who exists in my mind — the woman who anchored my family down — now lives only in the objects I connected to my formative memories of her: The kitchenwares, framed photographs, and textiles that were split among her living family members after my parents bought the house. They were once just home furnishings, but are now a direct line to a person in the midst of being erased. When I think of my parents’ new house, I draw the floor plan to Nonna’s house in my head. Then I fill it with all her physical belongings, the ones that still remind me of her, the ones I couldn’t save and that I’ll never see again. Even though Nonna is still alive, I include her.

When architects go on digs, the artifacts they uncover serve as irrefutable scientific evidence of the past. But they’re also objects that connect us to this past on a more visceral, sentimental level than carbon-dating. Physical artifacts can, to the trained eye, go well beyond confirming the existence of history — these objects tell us about habits, customs, fears, superstitions, victories celebrated and losses mourned; they tell us that people existed, and they tell us who those people were.

When my mother’s family moved to Canada from Northern Italy in 1959, they were stuff-less by necessity because there was no home ready for such things. The four of them — my mother, her older sister, and my Nonna and Nonno — first rented part of a house in a predominantly Italian neighbourhood in Guelph, later renting a whole house, all the while saving money for the plot of land they would eventually buy not far away by slowly buying only the stuff they needed: A matching pink couch, loveseat and chair, and a tufted, brocade couch for the basement; a television with knobs you’d twist to change the channels; a solid-wood kitchen table, so massive and imposing I always imagined they lowered it in with a crane before the house had a roof. After her husband died in 1984 — and, I think, even before — Nonna didn't replace things often, if ever, giving the impression that everything I ever knew Nonna to own was all she had ever owned.; Iin my mind she and her furniture, her pots and pans, her plates and cooking tools, are all inextricable from her. iThey were always in the same place (and, consequently, talways in the same place as her),and always in the same condition. Nonna and her things were constants, and while the stuff wasn't expensive or elaborate, but it was hers. She favoured olds sets of dishes for weeknight dinners of meaty pasta or perfect fried chicken cutlets with garlicky, parsley-studded mushrooms, and ancient tupperware for food storage. When things broke a little, she kept using them; when they broke a lot, she would fix them. There was a system to the way things were cared for: No plate or glass ever hit the kitchen table without a coaster or placemat beneath. Nonna cared about her home and possessions not because they were expensive, but because she bought them with her own money, and kept them in good shape. Her independence reflected in the purchase, the care, and the maintenance of a set of powder-pink living room furniture that may well have been brand new if not for their sort of awful late-60s hue. The way Nonna viewed her home and her things reflected how she viewed herself (and vice versa): With meticulous grooming, diligent upkeep, and the ability to either work around breaks as they happened, or fix them on her own. She cared for herself like a person who had the potential for permanence. There came a point when things began to degrade beyond her capacity for repair and upkeep. At first, this had to do mainly with Nonna’s physical limitations. It was difficult for her to descend the stairs to vacuum the basement, for example, so the rec room became permanently sealed off. Soon, my family was beginning to pitch in with laundry and small household chores. Without Nonna’s diligence, the house began to show its age. The plates, pans and utensils in her cupboards collected dust as they fell into disuse — she’d still cook sometimes, sure, but she didn’t have the energy for family dinners anymore. And sometimes, the recipes tasted just a bit off, like she’d forgotten a step, or confused the measurements for a couple of ingredients. She became anxious, distracted, and confused. But despite the physical evidence collecting around her — the house and everything in it, spotless and new for decades, was suddenly old and worn — Nonna denied there was anything wrong. Four years ago, she left a pot of water on the stove so long it was blackened beyond the point of cleaning or repair. She had completely forgotten it was there. In any other context, the incident might have been innocuous, but for Nonna — who had already been slowly losing grip on her stuff, her home, her independence — it was a tipping point. lLiving alone was no longer safe. My family began discussions about moving her to a retirement home, which involved discussions about what would come of her house, and of course, all her things. Near the end of Nonna’s time at the house, that kitchen table — around which we’d gather every Christmas, and at least on Sunday a month — began to crack right down the middle. The springs on the basement couch had become so worn, you’d almost hit the floor if you sat on it. And and who wanted a television that forced you to walk up to it just to change the channel? As anyone who’s divided an estate will tell you, the conversation around a loved one's possessions revolves largely around one question: What do you want? Some things were readily spoken for — the only two pots that remained of the set shipped over from Italy went to my mother and aunt. An espresso set, long coveted by one of my cousins, was set aside for him. The basement furniture, all of it worn by time or by the misuse of my sister and I, was donated or trashed. Last Easter, my sister and I sat down in my aunt’s basement to divide the possessions that had been set aside for us — mostly things from the kitchen. What was initially a conversation of utility, of looking at objects and determining, as I always do when deciding what I should own, whether they’re of actual use to me, became an exercise in remembering Nonna through her possessions. Things became impossible to discard. When presented with the physical manifestation of every Sunday dinner I’d ever eaten, invisibly imprinted with the memory of the woman who cooked them as I watched over her shoulder. I couldn’t imagine living without any of it. I took broken Tupperware that might have once carried leftover lasagna from Nonna’s house to ours, and a full set of cutlery despite already owning more than enough forks. I took a giant gilded soup tureen that I had never even seen before, because I knew it was part of a set that had been carefully carried over on a boat, in 1959, and an awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot whose only use, as far as I can tell, is boiling water. I wrapped it all up in a set of rags—threadbare after years of use dusting the framed photos of Nonno, which, along with some wedding gifts and pieces of jewellery, were the only sentimental things I knew Nonna to own—that are now vacuum sealed and packed away, to preserve Nonna’s crisp hemmed edges, never again to be used for their intended purpose. In Nonna’s things, I can still see her the way I remember her best: Proudly self-sufficient and independent. And if I keep her things clean, in good working order and in good repair, I feel like I can keep that Nonna — the one she herself fought to maintain, the one she tried for so long to deny we were all losing, the one who, in reality, disappeared many years ago — alive forever.

The last time I talked to Nonna on the phone, it was on her 87th birthday. She told me that she was very old now, that she hadn’t really felt up to doing anything that day. She asked if I was happy with my job and my apartment. Then she thanked me for calling and said goodbye. No “I love you.” Until four or five years ago, Nonna would repeat her “I love yous” at the end of a phone call until I had no choice but to hang up on her. I don’t doubt that she still loves me; it’s more likely that these days, after a few minutes, she doesn’t remember who called.

When I was younger, I took for granted what an indomitable force Nonna was. She lived alone and kept a home by herself for three decades, while acting as an emergency contact for my entire family, no matter what we needed: A ride, a loan, a night off. She could be difficult and demanding, but we were close. I was patient with her when she struggled with English, and, later, eager to learn from her when she cooked. When she still lived at home but had begun to experience waking nightmares, I spent a night there, and she felt safe enough to sleep through the night. In my adult life, I have used Nonna’s immovable spirit of independence as a guiding principle. Now, her loss of independence is devastating because it means I have lost the part of her of which I was most in awe, but also, because I am terrified of someday losing my own. The same things that happened to Nonna will probably happen to me, with or without dementia. I might not be able to wash the plates I took from her kitchen to mine, because they’re too heavy. My eyesight might prevent me from patching up small holes in t-shirts and dish cloths, and my back — which is already in bad shape, frankly — could make it hard for me to vacuum my carpets. I might forget how to cook the things I most love to eat. I will get old, and I will fight back against age as it claws back against my ability to do things for myself. And I, like Nonna, might refuse to negotiate and to accept that I simply can’t do things the way I used to. Frankly, I probably will: I’ve adopted a lot of Nonna’s obstinate self-sufficiency. I wonder if I’ll forget her awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot on the stove someday, and I wonder who will decide what happens to all of the things I’ve inherited from Nonna after I’ve forgotten that most of them ever existed in the first place. When I first saw how my parents had changed Nonna’s house, was like one of those dreams where you know you’re at your old high school but everything looks like your best friend’s kitchen. The cognitive disconnect was overwhelming. On an early visit, I ran my hand along one of the hallway walls, wondering if I’d be able to physically register that it now ends sooner than it used to. I’d close my eyes while sitting on the new, grey couch and pretend I was still sitting on the old, pink one; a feat of imagination assisted by a living room window that’s still the same width and height that it used to be. Though, with horizontal blinds replacing the old vertical ones — and slightly less light coming in — it feels like everything has gotten a bit colder, and a bit smaller. The truth is actually kind of the opposite: Nonna’s furniture took up so much more space than the stuff my parents own. Especially the table. And somehow, they lifted the massive wood one that hosted all the Christmas dinners, coffees, and conversations we never had anywhere else, and moved it out of the house. Nobody saved it. The crack down its middle had deepened into a chasm; the solid foundation that had once supported our family gatherings was being gradually replaced by a widening, empty gulf, unyielding as it was irreparable.",buzzfeed
9,The Spurs' Game 6 win was the ultimate proof Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate | FOX Sports,"In case that were still up for debate (you know, since the polling closed a month ago), San Antonio's Game 6 blowout of the Houston Rockets with Leonard on the bench served as all the evidence you need.

With Leonard on the sideline, the Spurs played a classic, Spurs-ian game. They moved the ball on offense, finding the open man and punishing the smaller Rockets on the interior. At one point, Houston had 64 total points, while San Antonio had 54 points in the paint alone.

This is no indictment of Leonard, no matter what some might tell you. (If anything, the result showed how valuable James Harden is to the Rockets. When he vanishes while somehow leaving his corporeal form behind, Houston is doomed.) In fact, credit LaMarcus Aldridge for playing within himself and the Spurs' natural offensive flow. He would have looked right at home on the championship-winning teams that beat LeBron James' Miami Heat.

Yet that's the point. The Spurs haven't had that same freedom of movement with Leonard running the offense this season, because he's learning on the job. He's learning quickly, sure, but he's not quite at the elite level as a primary offensive option that so many people think he is.

He's still adding pieces to his game — exploring what it means to be the creator on offense and the destroyer on defense, while trying to strike the balance between the two — and managing to play like one of the NBA's very best players along the way.

You can be incredibly valuable, getting better, and not be the MVP. There's some grey area left in this world, right?",fox-sports

It wasn’t all rookies at the event, as the team asked 10-time Pro Bowl tackle Joe Thomas – the longest-tenured Brown – to attend.

Tight end David Njoku, one of Cleveland’s three first-round picks, probably wishes his first meeting with Thomas went a little bit differently because it was definitely awkward. He thought Thomas was a coach, which I guess is an honest mistake.

9,10 MLB players who could lose their starting jobs soon | FOX Sports,"Baseball is a cruel, unforgiving game, and there are few players who are safe from losing their jobs if they find themselves mired in an ugly streak.

But these players, they're testing how long their rope is a fifth of the way through the year. How long can they stay out there before they get pulled?

For some, there's a young player clipping at their heels. For others, a contract that won't protect them from a demotion. Some have neither an immediate, obvious replacement or a short-term deal — they're just playing so poorly their teams have to consider a relegation.

9,8 ways Antonio Conte molded Chelsea into Premier League champions | FOX Sports,"Fabregas arrived at Chelsea in 2014/15 and made an immediate impact, dishing 18 assists to help propel Chelsea to the title. As was the case with most of the Blues, he dropped off significantly the following season. In came Conte this year and Fabregas was pushed more to the periphery with newcomer N'Golo Kante and holdover Nemanja Matic fitting more into Conte's scheme.

The Italian had a plan for Fabregas, though, deploying the midfielder as a substitute when Chelsea needed more creativity. Look no further than matchday 2, when the Blues trailed 1-0 at Watford in August. Fabregas came on in the 78th minute and Chelsea scored an equalizer two minutes later. Then, in the 87th, Chelsea got their winner from Diego Costa, with Fabregas providing the assist. Make no mistake, Fabregas was a huge piece to Conte's title-winning puzzle.",fox-sports

9,Happy Hour practice results for Go Bowling 400 | FOX Sports,"Practice is now complete for Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Kansas Speedway following the second of two sessions at the 1.5-mile track on Friday.

Tops in the 85-minute practice was defending race winner Kyle Busch, who ran a best lap of 187.963 miles per hour in his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota.

Second fast was Cup Series points leader Kyle Larson at 187.833 mph. Larson was followed by Martin Truex Jr., who topped the speed charts in the morning practice.

Rounding out the top five were Ryan Blaney and Brad Keselowski. Dale Earnhardt Jr. finished ninth.

There was one major incident and it involved points leader Larson.

Just six minutes into practice, Larson got loose in Turn 2 and hit the wall, forcing his Chip Ganassi Racing crew to pull out the team’s back-up car. Later in the session, Larson’s teammate, Jamie McMurray, brushed the wall, but his damage was considerably less.

Larson said he’d been wrestling with his car all day long. “I felt like I was going to crash every lap since we unloaded today,” said Larson. “We only made like seven laps the first practice because I was spinning out every time.”

And it was a problem that was not confined to Larson.

“I’ve been extremely loose all day. I think a lot of people have,” said Larson. “I don’t know why we are all fighting loose, but we made some big adjustments between the two practices there and I was still really loose.”

Also notable in practice: Carl Long practiced for a Cup Series race for the first time since 2009, when he was fined $200,000 for running a borrowed engine that was 0.17 cubic inches too large during practice for the Sprint Showdown last-chance all-star qualifying race at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

Long was 39th of 39 drivers in terms of speed, more than three seconds off the top lap turned in the session. But he made it on track, which is what matters.

Cup qualifying is tonight at 6:45 p.m., with the race on Saturday night, with coverage starting at 7 p.m. ET. Both qualifying and the race will be on FS1.

9,Who's winning the Carson Wentz trade: The Browns or the Eagles? | FOX Sports,"Leading up to last year’s NFL Draft, the Cleveland Browns were desperate for a quarterback. The Philadelphia Eagles were not. Sam Bradford was entrenched as the starter, giving them a decent, very capable quarterback to go into the season with.

Yet, it was the Eagles who made a shocking move up from No. 8 to No. 2, trading a boatload of picks in order to do so. The trade wound up costing Philadelphia two first-round picks (one in 2017), a third- and fourth-rounder in 2016 and a second-round pick in 2018. The Eagles effectively got Wentz and a 2017 fourth-rounder in exchange for five picks, a haul that looked like a major win for the Browns.

The Browns decided to trade down in both 2016 and 2017, turning those five selections into a whopping nine players.

Incredibly, they’re not done making picks from that monumental trade last year. The Browns still have a first- and second-round pick to use next year as a result of the trade.",fox-sports
9,5 reasons to watch UFC 211: Miocic vs. dos Santos 2 | FOX Sports,"Will Joanna be challenged?

Joanna Jedrzejczyk has _maybe_ lost two rounds during her run as UFC champion. And she lost those rounds in a fight that she ended up handily winning in a battle against Claudia Gadelha last year.

Other than that, Jedrzejczyk has been downright dominant during her run as champion, amassing a 517 to 178 advantage in significant strikes in her other three title defenses.

Odds are, things change a bit for the Polish superstar, but just how much remains to be seen.

Her opponent, Jessica Andrade is an extremely talented fighter who is accustomed to scraping with much bigger women as she began her UFC career as a bantamweight before dropping to strawweight last year.

She’s a rare mix of power and speed and fully capable of putting the pressure on Jedrzejczyk and winning rounds on fight now. But will she fade like Jedrzejczyk’s other opponents? We’ll find out on Saturday.",fox-sports
9,No. 1 overall pick Myles Garrett admits he ‘can’t be a savior’ for the Browns | FOX Sports,"The Cleveland Browns are in desperate need of a player who can resurrect the franchise and get it back on the winning track. That player will likely be a quarterback one day, but the Browns have yet to find the right man for the job.

Some hope that No. 1 overall pick Myles Garrett can save the team on the defensive side of the ball, but even he knows that’s impossible. He admitted as much Friday when speaking about the Browns in 2017.

“It takes a culmination of all these guys coming together and just having the attitude that we’re not going to lose. And that’s what we’re going to do. I can’t be a savior,” Garrett said, via NFL.com. “But I can be the best I can be. I can give it my all and make plays and dominate my side of the field, but it takes all 11 guys with a certain thought process that we’re going to go out there and we’re going to win.”

Garrett is going to be a Day 1 starter for the Browns and is the favorite to win Defensive Rookie of the Year. He has all the makings of a cornerstone defender in the mold of Von Miller and J.J. Watt, which should provide the fan base with some excitement.

That being said, he’s not going to win the Browns games without a lot of help. He’s not going to turn them into a playoff team after they won just one game in 2016.

Garrett said himself that “one person can’t win games,” making it clear that it takes an entire team to have success in the NFL. Sure, his play as a rookie will help the Browns win more often in 2017 – or at least they hope so – but he can’t do it all.

He remains as confident as ever, though, after saying he wants to sack Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger most in the NFL – and he plans to back it up.

“You just gotta back up your words. Don’t be scared from it or don’t shy from it,” Garrett said. “Make sure, if you’re willing to say something, that you worked hard enough and prepared well enough to back those things up.”",fox-sports
6,Russian jet flies within 20 feet of US Navy plane,"Story highlights Encounter described by US Navy as ""safe and professional""

US official said pilot took photos of US plane

Washington (CNN) A Russian military jet ""came within approximately 20 feet"" of a US Navy P-8A Poseidon surveillance plane while it was flying in international airspace over the Black Sea earlier this week, US Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze told CNN on Friday.

The encounter occurred on Tuesday and was described by the US Navy as ""safe and professional.""

""Distance is only one of many variables considered when defining what is safe and professional,"" Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said. ""For aviation interactions, distance, speed, altitude, rate of closure, visibility and other factors impact whether an event is characterized as safe or unsafe, professional or not professional.""

A US defense official told CNN that the Russian aircraft was armed with six air-to-air missiles and that the pilot took photos of the US plane during the encounter.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, ""The Russian fighter carried out a 'greeting' maneuver. After that, the US surveillance aircraft changed his flying course away from the Russian border.""

3,FBI chief sacking: White House denies Comey loyalty pledge,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Did President Trump threaten the former FBI director in a tweet?

The White House has denied reports that President Donald Trump asked former FBI chief James Comey to pledge loyalty to him.

Press secretary Sean Spicer rejected a New York Times report that the president sounded out Mr Comey at a private White House dinner in January.

According to the newspaper, the now-former FBI director said he would offer the president honesty, but not loyalty.

Mr Trump has faced a backlash for firing Mr Comey on Tuesday.

The FBI probe and parallel congressional investigations into alleged Russian political meddling, and whether any Trump campaign officials colluded with the Kremlin, have dogged his young presidency.

In Friday's daily briefing, Mr Spicer refused to comment on questions about whether Mr Trump had been making surreptitious recordings in the White House.

Mr Trump tweeted hours earlier that Mr Comey had ""better hope there are no tapes"" of their conversations.

Mr Spicer denied the tweet was a threat towards Mr Comey.

""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" he told reporters repeatedly when pressed about the tweet. ""The tweet speaks for itself"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump addresses the reasons for the sacking in an NBC interview

However, Mr Comey believes ""if there is a tape, there is nothing he is worried about"", a source told CNN.

Mr Trump's comments provoked fresh comparisons between his administration and that of disgraced President Richard Nixon, who famously recorded conversations, speeding his downfall during the Watergate scandal.

Why is Watergate in the news again?

The top Democrats on the House judiciary and oversight committees wrote to the White House on Friday demanding copies of any recordings.

John Conyers and Elijah Cummings' letter noted ""it is a crime to intimidate or threaten any potential witness with the intent to influence, delay or prevent their official testimony"".

'Flooding the zone': Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher

Donald Trump was reportedly unhappy with how his press team handled fallout from Tuesday's decision to fire Mr Comey, so he's taken things into his own hands. Boy, has he.

First he gave an interview that essentially undercut all the arguments White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, had made to paint the Comey sacking as an operation conducted through normal channels. Now he has taken to Twitter in earnest, spraying a barrage of allegations, accusations and aggressions against Democrats, the media and Mr Comey himself.

In sports terms, the strategy could be described as ""flooding the zone"" - launching a ferocious, full-out assault to overwhelm an opponent's defences. In this case, Mr Trump has the media scrambling to decide which story merits the most coverage.

Is it the details of the Comey-Trump dinner and the president's hints of secret ""tapes""? His threat to cancel press briefings? The Oval Office visit by a Russian entourage? Perhaps, as Mr Trump suggests, the ""real news"" is the tentative trade agreement between the US and China on beef and poultry products?

When everything is a big story, nothing is. At least, that's what Mr Trump may hope.

Mr Comey has declined an invitation to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee next Tuesday.

President Trump told NBC News that Mr Comey had requested the one-on-one, but the former FBI director reportedly maintains that it was the president who invited him.

Mr Comey had said he was ""uneasy"" before the dinner, according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

He told MSNBC on Friday that he had spoken to Mr Comey before the White House meeting.

The FBI chief had confided he was concerned it might compromise his Trump-Russia inquiry.

Mr Trump has said Mr Comey told him three times he was not a target of the FBI inquiry, comments that have raised accusations among opponents that the president was interfering in the investigation.

Still chafing at media coverage of the firing, Mr Trump tweeted on Friday: ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future 'press briefings' and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What do Trump supporters think about Comey's firing?

Mr Spicer said the president was a ""little dismayed"" that his press team's attempts to give out information were being turned into a ""game of gotcha"" by the media.

Mr Trump doubled down in an interview with Fox News by threatening to hold the press briefings only once a fortnight, with himself at the podium.

""Unless I have them every two weeks and I do them myself, we don't have them. I think it's a good idea. First of all, you have a level of hostility that's incredible and it's very unfair.""

9,NFLPA sets up reserve fund in case of work stoppage,"NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell (Photo: H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY Sports)

If the NFL goes through another work stoppage after the 2020 season, its players union intends to be ready financially — and efforts to save money are about to ramp up.

The NFL Players Association’s board of representatives approved a resolution in March that will divert millions of dollars in licensing royalties to a work-stoppage fund, three people with knowledge of the resolution told USA TODAY Sports this week.

Based on current rates, that could add in the neighborhood of $90 million to the NFLPA’s coffers over the next four years before the current collective bargaining agreement expires around March 2021, on top of union dues that already are saved for that purpose.

According to one of the people — all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because NFLPA resolutions aren’t public — players still will receive their royalty checks this fall as usual from the 2016 fiscal year. Only the “equal share” distributed to all players will be affected starting next year, not any additional royalties earned by individuals, the person said.

MORE NFL:

The NFLPA’s last annual report, filed in June 2016 with the U.S. Department of Labor, shows the equal share was $13,200 for 2015. Multiplied over 53 players on 32 active rosters, the total would be $22,387,200. That doesn’t factor in additional players who spend time on rosters, nor the probability of annual growth in the multibillion-dollar industry.

The resolution passed in March says royalties would be held in the work stoppage fund until there is a work stoppage or upon a player’s retirement. If there’s no work stoppage, the funds would be paid out to players immediately upon approval of a new CBA. If there is a work stoppage, the funds would be paid out as determined by the NFLPA board — something it did a little over a month after owners locked out players in March 2011.

A person with knowledge of the NFL’s thinking said the league has no such work-stoppage fund at this time. (In 2011, the union contended the NFL had illegally secured a “war chest” of $4 billion in TV revenue as a means to survive the lockout, leading to one of many legal battles.)

The league has approached the union several times about renegotiating the 2011 CBA, but no bargaining talks have occurred, people with knowledge of the situation said.

Among other issues that could prompt an early extension, the NFL is out of so-called “stadium credits” to support construction as allotted under the 2011 CBA. The evolving media landscape creates a new frontier for negotiating TV deals that are a primary revenue source (one from which players draw 55% under the current deal.) The commissioner’s authority over discipline and offseason practice rules also are sure to come up, but financial matters drive everything.

Amidst labor strife, money tends to create a pain point more quickly for players, many of whom can’t afford to miss paychecks that usually begin in September. Union dues, which ranged from $1,000 to $16,312.50 last year, already go into savings. (The NFLPA listed over $314 million in net assets, including over $60 million in cash, on its federal filing last year.)

Replacing the late Gene Upshaw after his death in 2008, NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith had been on the job less than two years when the 2011 lockout hit. Creating the work-stoppage fund is one way the union seems to be using the extra lead time to get ready.",usa-today
9,"Ex-Cowboys linebacker Rolando McClain arrested, faces drug, firearm charges | FOX Sports","Former Dallas Cowboys linebacker Rolando McClain, who had been suspended indefinitely by the NFL last season, was arrested in Hartselle, Ala., Friday and faces firearm and drug charges.

6,Russia ridicules US reaction to Comey firing,"Moscow (CNN) Russians don't know whether to laugh or cry at the political chaos unfolding in the United States.

In fact, they have been doing lots of both.

Sergey Lavrov, the wry Russian foreign minister, allowed himself a quip when asked whether the sudden dismissal of the FBI director, James Comey, would overshadow his talks this week in Washington.

""Was he fired?"" Lavrov asked reporters, sarcastically.

""You're kidding, you're kidding,"" he exclaimed.

#Lavrov: Was FBI Director James Comey fired? You're kidding! pic.twitter.com/5OXNKBF2QA — MFA Russia 🇷🇺 (@mfa_russia) May 10, 2017

Perhaps it was an ill-judged attempt to lighten the mood, but it also revealed the extent to which Russian officials are reveling in their US rivals' current mess.

Critics frequently accuse the Kremlin of wanting to discredit US politics. That work seems to be proceeding without them.

That ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, dubbed a key Russian spy by US officials, is at the center of allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Russian officials that Comey was investigating before he was dismissed.

The optics, as we now call what stuff looks like, were bad.

6,Sources: Rosenstein sees no need for special prosecutor in Russia probe,"(CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein doesn't see a need at this point for a special prosecutor in the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, people familiar with his thinking tell CNN.

Democratic lawmakers and others have pushed for the move in the wake of the controversy over President Donald Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Critics of the Trump administration's handling of the Russia investigation have long held the view that a special prosecutor is needed.

The investigation is led by Dana Boente, the US attorney in Alexandria, Va., who also serves as the head of national security prosecutions at Justice Department headquarters.

One source says Rosenstein isn't inclined to make a change unless the FBI investigation appears to be imperiled. And at this point, FBI officials are confident that the investigation is moving ahead, despite Comey's abrupt firing earlier this week.

Indeed, Rosenstein has privately vowed to lawmakers and staff that he plans to allow the bureau's investigation to move forward, uninhibited by pressures from the White House.

6,Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein not ready to appoint special prosecutor for Russia investigation,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein leaves the Hart Senate Office Building on May 11, 2017. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has indicated that he is not yet inclined to appoint a special prosecutor to take over the FBI's inquiry into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.

The ultimate decision on whether to seek an outside counsel, which Democrats have demanded following President Trump's abrupt dismissal of FBI director James Comey on Tuesday, falls to Rosenstein because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from any involvement in the Russia probe.

The latest details on Rosenstein's position on the matter, which was first reported by CNN, comes as the Justice Department leader agreed to brief the full Senate on his role in President Trump's firing of Comey.

Rosenstein, who along with Sessions recommended Comey's dismissal, informed Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer's office on Friday that he would meet with senators next week, according to Matt House, Schumer's spokesman. The time and date are still being worked out, he said.

Rosenstein is certain to face grilling from Democrats, who have ramped up their calls a special prosecutor to takeover the Russia investigation. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, pushed the issue further on Friday, saying Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor or resign.

Contrary to his administration's early assertions, Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt on Thursday he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein and Sessions' recommendation. He added that he was thinking of ""this Russia thing"" when he made the decision, calling it a ""made-up story.""

In a morning tweetstorm, he appeared to threaten Comey if he leaked ""tapes"" of their conversations to the media.

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Durbin cast Trump's statement as an admission that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation, which he said is ""dangerously close to obstruction of justice."" He said Trump's tweet could be another violation of law.

""This morning, the President tweeted a thinly-veiled threat to Mr. Comey, which could be construed as threatening a witness in this investigation, which is another violation of federal law,"" Durbin said in a statement. ""To preserve his reputation as a credible prosecutor, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein must appoint an independent special prosecutor to pursue possible criminal charges, or he must resign.""

Read more:

In a memo to Sessions justifying Comey's dismissal, Rosenstein cited Comey’s controversial handling of the investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. But there has been wide skepticism among Democrats and some Republicans about the president's motives.

Because of Rosenstein's role, Schumer has argued that a non-political appointee of the Justice Department should be responsible for tapping a special prosecutor rather than Rosenstein. He called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to invite not only Rosenstein but Sessions to brief all senators in separate and possibly classified meetings.

McConnell has said that opening a new probe into the Trump campaign's alleged Russian connections would impede the work of the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation.

Comey had been invited to testify before the committee on Tuesday, but the panel's top-ranking Democrat said on MSNBC on Friday that won't happen. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said he hopes Comey will appear before the committee in the ""not too distant future.""

""I have enormous respect for Jim Comey and I believe that at the appropriate time and place he's going to tell his side of the story and my hope is that that place at least will be in front of our committee,"" Warner said.

9,Daniel Cormier vs. Jon Jones 2 official for UFC 214 in Anaheim | FOX Sports,"More than a year after their last fight was cancelled, light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier will finally met Jon Jones at UFC 214 in Anaheim on July 29.

The new bout was announced as part of the UFC’s Summer Kickoff press conference on Friday.

The two longtime rivals were last scheduled to meet at UFC 200 last July, but Jones was pulled off the card after he was flagged for a doping violation stemming from an out-of-competition drug test.

Cormier stayed on the card where he defeated former middleweight champion Anderson Silva. Jones ultimately faced a one-year suspension as a result of his UFC anti-doping policy infraction but he returns to eligibility in July.

Cormier (19-1) fought most recently at UFC 210 in Buffalo where he submitted Anthony “Rumble” Johnson with an impressive performance to mark his second title defense since winning the belt in 2015.

Meanwhile, Jones (22-1) has gone through a tumultuous few years to finally get back to fight for the light heavyweight title again.

Jones was initially stripped of the belt after he was involved in a hit-and-run accident that ended with a long suspension from the UFC. Jones finally returned last April where he defeated Ovince Saint-Preux by unanimous decision to win an interim title while Cormier was out of action due to injury.

Jones was then stripped of that belt after he tested positive for the banned substance before he sat out for a year as punishment.

Now the long road back will lead Jones to a rematch with arguably his greatest rival while Cormier tries to erase the only loss of his professional fighting career.",fox-sports
9,Watch the goal that clinched the Premier League title for Chelsea | FOX Sports,"For more than 80 minutes, it looked as though Chelsea’s title-winning celebrations would have to be put on hold. West Bromwich Albion played a tight and organized defense under Tony Pulis at the Hawthorns, keeping a lid on the Blues. Chelsea pushed forward, and the Baggies pushed them away.

With the Blues looking frustrated, manager Antonio Conte pulled a double switch to try and find a difference-maker. Surprisingly, off came Eden Hazard and Pedro for Willian and Michy Batshuayi in the 75th and 76th minutes. But as he’s done all season, Conte pressed the exact right button as the seldom-used Batshauyi delivered the title-clinching goal in the 82nd minute.

And, exhale. It wasn’t the prettiest match-winner, but it counted all the same. It was just Batshuayi’s second Premier League goal of the season, his first since matchday 2.

6,Lib Dems to back a 'regulated cannabis market' in UK,"Image caption The party has long argued drugs laws are a ""failure"" and made fresh calls for a regulated cannabis market

The Liberal Democrats would legalise selling and growing cannabis if elected, the party has confirmed ahead of publishing its manifesto.

The party would allow licensed shops to sell the drug to over-18s, let people grow cannabis at home and introduce small ""cannabis social clubs"".

The Lib Dem spring conference in 2016 backed a regulated cannabis market.

The party's manifesto will also include a promise to extend paid parental leave for fathers from two weeks to a month.

Under UK legislation, anyone found possessing cannabis can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both punishments - but many argue that the law is not enforced.

Supplying or producing cannabis, which is a class ""B"" drug, attracts a maximum 14-year prison sentence, unlimited fine or both, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

'Criminal gangs'

It is legal to consume small amounts of marijuana in some other countries - including Norway, the Netherlands and Portugal - while in other countries police do not arrest people for possession.

In 2001, Portugal became the first country in the world to decriminalise the use of all drugs.

Last year, the Lib Dems backed proposals for a ""regulated market"" to control the pricing, potency and packaging of sales to over-18s.

The proposals were outlined in a report, co-authored by the government's former chief drugs adviser Sir David Nutt, which argued that cannabis should be taxed - and that doing so could yield up to £1bn a year for the government.

Image caption In the Netherlands, cannabis products are sold in ""coffee shops"" and possession of small amounts for personal use is allowed

The Lib Dems' Julian Huppert confirmed the policy would appear in its upcoming manifesto to BuzzFeed, saying: ""The market is run by criminal gangs and they have no interest in public health - the system is causing huge amounts of harm.""

During the 2015 election campaign, the Lib Dems called for drug use to be treated as a health rather than a public policy issue.

Labour in its 2015 manifesto called for better drug treatment services, while the Conservatives said they would introduce random drug-testing in jails.

Speaking last year, the Lib Dems' health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said that ""the war on drugs has been a catastrophic failure"".

""We criminalise thousands of people, blighting their careers,"" he said. ""When people buy cannabis from criminals, they have no idea what they are buying.""

'Health and happiness'

The party is also promising extra paid paternity leave - which it is calling ""Daddy Month"" in a bid to encourage more sharing of parental responsibilities.

Jo Swinson, equalities minister in the coalition government when shared parental leave was introduced in 2015, said: ""More needs to be done to encourage men to take leave when they become a dad.

""Research shows that fathers being more involved in their children's lives is good for children's development and good for the health and happiness of the whole family.""

Labour has also said it supports extending paid paternity leave.",bbc-news

9,Danica Patrick on Stenhouse Jr. win: 'We absolutely never mess with each other' | FOX Sports,"In any healthy adult relationship, establishing clear-cut boundaries is important for both parties. Even when the two parties are both Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series drivers.

So when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. scored his first career Cup win Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway, there was no trash talk towards his girlfriend and rival driver Danica Patrick.

Patrick said Friday at Kansas Speedway that teasing each other about what happens on the track is strictly forbidden

“We absolutely never mess with each other when it comes to that stuff,” said Patrick. “I think it is obviously because it means so much to us that it is a pretty crappy thing to do. Would you mess with your wife or girlfriend?”

Recreational sports, however, are fair game.

“When it comes to golf or something I will totally mess with him but when it comes to something like this (racing), no,” Patrick said. “We don’t talk about that at all. I was just simply happy for him and my weekend sucked yet again. Actually my weekend didn’t really suck. I had a fine race going and it just ended early so I had another terrible result, which has been the case so far this year.”

That said, Patrick was clearly happy to see Stenhouse win, which was made easier by the fact that she got wrecked and knocked out of the race.

“I am really glad I had the chance to watch him win,” she said. “I think that was pretty cool and that I was ready to go. All I did was throw my tennis shoes on and got out the door on the golf cart and went to victory lane and waited for him to pull in.

“That was a gift of an experience to be able to have in our relationship because most of the time I would be dealing with my team and dealing with whatever I had going on. I had that chance to regroup,” Patrick said. “I was fresh as a daisy. I had showered and spend the afternoon standing around celebrating with him. It was a great day.”

9,Michael Johnson welcomes Justin Gaethje to the UFC at 'Ultimate Fighter 25' Finale | FOX Sports,"Highly touted lightweight Justin Gaethje has officially booked his first fight in the UFC.

The undefeated knockout artist, who just recently inked a multi-fight deal with the UFC, will face off with veteran competitor Michael Johnson in the main event at “The Ultimate Fighter” 26 finale on July 7 in Las Vegas.

The new fight was announced as part of the UFC’s Summer Kickoff press conference on Friday in Dallas.

Gaethje (17-0) was one of the most sought after free agents available in the open market after finishing out his previous contract with World Series of Fighting.

During his time with that promotion, Gaethje reigned as lightweight champion would putting on some of the most thrilling bouts every single time he stepped into the cage. Now Gaethje will look to test himself against the best of the best in the UFC starting with his fight against Johnson.

Johnson (17-11) will look to hand Gaethje his first professional loss as he steps back into the Octagon for the first time since suffering a loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov last November at UFC 205.

Prior to that setback, Johnson earned a “Performance of the Night” bonus for his stunning first round knockout against Dustin Poirier.

6,Trump lying about Comey firing isn't new,"This is the same guy who maintained for years that Obama was born in Kenya.

Protest in Washington on May 10, 2017. (Photo: Shawn Thew, epa)

Even before President Trump announced his firing of FBI director James Comey last Tuesday, the White House was mired in a credibility crisis. Trump’s dictatorial tendencies, his apparent inability to tell a consistent story and his perennial challenge with the truth have brought us, in the eyes of some of his critics, to the verge of a constitutional crisis. At the very least, his behavior has made it virtually impossible for anyone but the most gullible to believe much of what he says — including the reasons given for firing Comey.

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner deemed “laughable” the official explanation that Comey was fired for mishandling the Hillary Clinton email scandal. And that laughable explanation — added to countless other questionable or outright false statements from Trump and his surrogates — has forced America to grapple with a serious question: What happens when government believes in neither facts nor in the truth? We are beginning to find out.

This week, before Comey’s firing shocked the nation, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was dismissing several members of its Board of Scientific Counselors with an eye toward replacing them with industry hacks. Impartial scientists and their bothersome facts apparently are no longer welcome at the EPA.

Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he was replacing his predecessor’s “Smart on Crime” initiative with what can only be called a “Stupid on Crime” punitive approach that few serious scholars of criminal justice believe is either warranted or effective.

This, of course, comes on the heels of the House passage of a health care bill whose likely bad consequences Trump’s supporters chose to deny and whose tax cuts were peddled to the public using the same “voodoo economics” rationale that George H. W. Bush rightly denounced nearly four decades ago.

Trump’s distaste for truth and verifiable facts is no surprise. During the presidential campaign The New York Times reminded readers that in 2011 Trump settled a case claiming that he and members of his family had lied about the market for his luxury condominium hotel apartments. And The Washington Post exhaustively reported on a 2007 deposition in which Trump admitted repeating false allegations rooted in nothing more than “my perception.” Then, of course, there was the years-long running roadshow during which Trump suggested Barack Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim. That misbegotten crusade yielded gems such as this one from a Trump appearance on The Today Show: “His grandmother in Kenya said, 'Oh, no, he was born in Kenya…' She's on tape and I think that tape's going to be produced fairly soon. Somebody is coming out with a book in two weeks, it will be very interesting."" No book or tape, of course, ever came out. It was all just a figment of Trump’s peculiar “perception.”

Following Trump’s electoral college victory, the only real question was whether he would bring the methods and ethics of a truth-challenged real estate huckster to what is arguably the most important job in the world — a job in which integrity and truth should count for something. After a blizzard of tweets and comments — including the notable nonsense that Obama tapped Trump’s phones — the answer is obvious.

Trump’s treatment of Comey is nothing if not consistent with his past behavior. As widely reported, during the campaign, Trump praised Comey for his “guts” and for making “the move” on Clinton. Now Trump finds those very actions grounds for dismissal. What is the truth of how Trump actually feels? Apparently, he expects people to accept whatever version of truth or untruth is convenient for him at the moment. And while that may have worked well for a while, even gullible people have their limits — which Trump is sorely testing.

Still, Trump’s people are shocked, SHOCKED, that so many of his constituents don’t believe him, that despite Trump wrapping himself in the trappings and power of the White House, many look at him and still see the real-estate salesman out to con a gullible public for his own glory and enrichment.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

When the Trump administration came to office, we heard a lot about so-called alternative facts. But what we are seeing instead is a government that prefers to act on the basis of no facts at all and that dismisses truth with assertions that often prove to be lies — all the while shouting about fake news.

Unfortunately, dismissed facts don’t simply go away. Eventually many surface as serious problems — problems that could and should have been foreseen and addressed. The question Trump’s presidency vividly raises is how much his fellow Americans are prepared to accept or buy into his fantastical fact-free approach. Clearly many are already fed up. Others, for any number of possible reasons (apathy, anger, fear and gullibility among them), are content to close their eyes to the consequences of Trump’s actions. Also, because Trump is no longer a simple reality star and real estate flim flam man but the most powerful politician in the world, there is a sincere desire, in some quarters, to believe in him — if only out of respect for the office he holds. But perhaps what most empowers Trump is partisanship, the reluctance of all but a precious few of his fellow Republicans to utter anything remotely resembling criticism of him, or to demand that he be held to account — even if that makes them complicit in covering up possible collusion with a foreign power. It should not be so difficult for anointed guardians of the public trust to demand truth, transparency and accountability; but it seems that much of the modern Republican Party has lost is way. And Trump is only too happy to lead his feckless enablers ever farther into the weeds.

6,The high stakes of the Comey controversy,"Those shocks will continue to reverberate next week and beyond because the issues involved are fundamental to American democracy, challenging the credibility of the White House and the vital legal institutions that sustain government.

As always in politics, timing is everything, and the timing here raises questions about the use and possible abuse of presidential power: Why did Trump do it? And more importantly, why now?

Orchestrating the chaos, as always, was Trump himself, who largely stayed out of public view last week but managed to incite pandemonium nonetheless.

In a dizzying sequence of events, sacked acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned in Senate testimony Monday that ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn was a ripe blackmail target for Russia while in office. The President suddenly fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, and then blindsided his own vice president with his shifting reasoning before sabotaging the White House press operation that was trying to defend him. Amid reports he demanded a loyalty pledge from Comey, critics warned Trump was guilty of a grotesque abuse of power, or even worse. But the President was not done. He suggested that Comey's investigation into links between his presidential campaign and Russia were indeed the reason he was fired.

In a Friday morning tweetstorm, he seemed to suggest he had a Nixon-style White House taping operation, and told Comey to stay mum. Next, he proposed ending press briefings because it's impossible for his communications team to keep up with the whiplash of his stream-of-consciousness presidency.

View from afar

Meanwhile, out in the country, the political contagion is spreading.

In North Dakota, tempers boiled over at a town hall event hosted by Rep. Kevin Cramer. A man demanded to know whether the rich would benefit from the repeal of Obamacare and was escorted out by police after trying to shove a wad of cash into Cramer's collar.

Republican Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan was shouted down by constituents shouting ""health care for all.""

GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur, who helped pass the Obamacare repeal bill, walked into a metaphorical bear pit in his New Jersey district. ""Open your eyes!"" screamed one anti-Trump voter.

In West Virginia, a reporter was arrested after firing a string of questions at Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.

At times, in Washington and elsewhere, it seemed as thought the country's political equilibrium was at grave risk. It's now normal to observe that Trump is not like a conventional politician, that the point of his political project is to flout norms and shake up the cozy establishment and that the press takes him too literally.

And when Trump behaves in a way that has the media and Washington establishment types running around with their hair on fire, his loyal base of voters who sent him to the White House see a mission accomplished.

Loyalty

There's also no sign that congressional leaders are ready to desert him. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for instance, said Friday: ""I've decided I'm not going to comment on the tweets of the day or the hour.""

Trump went back to his seemingly impervious well of political support Friday, in a fundraising drive emailed to supporters in which he said : ""Let's show the hypocrites, liars, and 'elites' of Washington that the American people are dead serious about our mission to DRAIN THE SWAMP.""

But despite the loyalty of his base and for all the cacophony of the last three months, and the riotous campaign in 2016, the last week has seemed different. It felt at times that the White House was spinning off its political axis, that the President was isolated even from his own staff and that there was little rhyme or reason behind his increasingly erratic statements.

Trump's often frazzled but loyal press secretary Sean Spicer was even asked in his daily briefing on Friday whether Trump was ""out of control.""

""That's, frankly, offensive,"" Spicer said.

Yet, so extreme have been the events of the last few days that such a question -- which many would view as outrageous in more normal times -- didn't seem out of bounds.

Wild ride

While Trump has taken America on a wild ride since taking office, things did appear to get substantially more surreal and serious this week, with the possibility even looming that the President had edged closer to legal jeopardy with his stunning decision to can Comey while he was overseeing the Russia probe.

Spicer's stand-in, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, meanwhile, made a series of statements about Comey's popularity within the bureau and the scope of the FBI investigation that were comprehensively refuted by acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe in congressional testimony on Thursday.

Some Republicans are worried about the trajectory of Trump's presidency amid concern that a distracted White House could squander its opportunity to use a GOP majority to reshape the country's politics.

""This is ridiculous, it is not tenable and Republicans ... just politically, this cannot last, so go ahead and start holding the President accountable, the bogeyman is not going to come out from under your bed,"" Amanda Carpenter, a former communications aide to Sen. Ted Cruz said on ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Friday. ""Donald Trump's special police are not going to come get you in the middle of the night.""

""If you say, 'Mr. President, please respect the three branches of government. Please respect the American institution as it's supposed to work' ... you will be much better off,"" said Carpenter, a CNN commentator.

But beyond the politics, there's another element to the Trump presidency that makes it so discombobulating for many people.

Thanks to the President's mastery of social media, it's hard to escape him. He sometimes seems to be lurking on every device, from your iPhone to your laptop to your television, and thus barges into countless conversations or social occasion. If nothing else, by the end of his presidency, America may face the political equivalent post traumatic stress disorder. And the societal damage from Trump's perpetual war on institutions like the intelligence agencies, the courts and the media might take may years to assess.

In that sense, Friday's tweet storm blasting Comey and the ""fake media"" was just the capstone of a madcap week.

""It's just the latest of an incredibly, peculiar, disturbing, 48 hours,"" said David Axelrod, former Obama campaign guru and CNN senior political analyst.

Timothy Naftali, a CNN historian and former director of the Nixon Library, suggested that the President would do well to reconsider his approach.

""I believe the President of the United States needs to think about his credibility,"" Naftali told CNN's Kate Bolduan, referring to Trump's response to the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling. Though there was no evidence he was guilty of anything, Trump is acting like he is, Naftali said.

""This is bigger than him, he is our head of state, he is our bald eagle, he represents our country. Perhaps there might be a time for a little bit of a moment and little reflection ... perhaps he might want to think about his conduct more seriously than he has up to now,"" he said.

Credibility

But it is not just Trump whose credibility seemed tarnished after his week. The reputation of his press shop has also taken a hit.

The suddenness of Comey's firing took the White House communications team by surprise, but they quickly built a rationale that the reason Comey was gone was a damning report on his handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe complied by the new deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.

It didn't seem remotely credible, but at least it was something. Within hours the tale was unraveling, but not before Vice President Mike Pence had put his own reputation on the line by peddling it to reporters on Capitol Hill.

Even though White House aides insisted repeatedly the firing had nothing to do with Russia, they were finally and disastrously undermined by their own boss.

""In fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,'"" Trump told NBC in an interview.

His comments made an already dicey job for Spicer's team all but impossible.

""I think the credibility is gone, and I'm really sorry to say that,"" said John Kirby, a former State Department and Pentagon spokesman who is now a CNN analyst.

""I don't think there is a crisis of credibility, I think it is shot, and I don't know how they ever get it back,"" Kirby said.

Some Republicans are meanwhile worried that the trust that has eroded in a fraught political time for the White House will leave the administration flailing when an inevitable international or national crisis flares.

""Having the President undermine the credibility of his staff makes their jobs harder not just today but moving forward,"" said Republican strategist Doug Heye on CNN.

""This White House has had a lot of crises but not a real true crisis yet. When that crisis hits, Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, they need credibility in front of those reporters who are going to be gunning after them and the President hurt them today. That is a real challenge for this White House.""",cnn
6,"Isolated and agitated, Trump rattles White House from within","Washington (CNN) A buoyant President Donald Trump reemerged into public for the first time in more than a week on Friday, offering few signs of the malaise that has gripped his administration since the hasty dismissal of FBI Director James Comey.

""It's such an honor to be here,"" Trump declared to a group of military mothers gathered in the East Room for a Mother's Day event. ""So bright and festive.""

Downstairs, the mood was anything but.

In conversations with multiple advisers, conducted on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, officials described to CNN a sense of dejection within the West Wing ranks, where most aides were caught off guard by Trump's decision and had little ability to develop a cogent response. Even Vice President Mike Pence, who found his public statements again undercut by Trump himself, was ""a little rattled"" at the events of the week, according to an administration adviser.

Through it all, Trump has remained largely out of sight, not leaving the White House once since he returned late Sunday night. He grew increasingly isolated and agitated, associates tell CNN, going a full week without hearing the applause and adulation that often brightens his mood.

Eager to move on

The President's public schedule has been devoid of opportunities for the press to see him since last Thursday. The absence came on a week when his decision to fire Comey consumed Washington; the President acted as an invisible central player to the drama, tweeting in spurts about alleged links between his campaign and Russia while largely remaining entrenched behind closed doors at the White House.

The quiet stretch was long-planned, officials said, with little expectation that Trump would deliver a bombshell. Instead, many in Trump's circle now view the past four days as the worst stretch of Trump's presidency so far. All are eager to move on.

""I think a lot of people are trying to figure out the new dynamic in town,"" one senior White House official said Friday, conceding the learning curve was often just as steep for those working steps from the Oval Office as across town.

Some of the more seasoned aides inside the West Wing refer to Trump as ""the hurry-up president,"" full of risk and reward. But this week, aides bluntly conceded, the risks were far more apparent. It was a fresh reminder the administration is not prepared to deal with a crisis of its own making, never mind a catastrophe outside its control.

Still, inside the West Wing the mood appeared to lift somewhat by the end of the week, as one exhausted aide declared, ""It's Friday.""

Trump, in both individual meetings and larger sessions, personally worked to bolster his staff's plummeting morale after rampant criticism of their inability to cast his firing of Comey in a positive light.

But the scars were still apparent, with one White House official asking: ""Do you think we're liars?""

And just as some aides began to feel on firmer footing after Comey's dismissal, Trump revived his longtime obsession with surveillance, suggesting that he was recording conversations inside the Oval Office. Neither Trump nor his spokesman tamped down on the implication, a telling development for a White House not shy about publicly rebutting what it claims is false reporting.

Another distraction

It was another distraction from a governing agenda that, only a week ago, appeared on track. Comey clean-up efforts largely crowded out attempts to move on to other items, leading to fears among White House staff that Trump's governing agenda may be derailed.

Aside from vague references to rebuilding the military during his Mother's Day remarks, Trump has otherwise made no mention of policy in public since Thursday of last week, when his administration hit its high mark after passage of a GOP health care bill in the House of Representatives.

When he did emerge for a pair of interviews, Trump only seemed to deepen questions about the episode. He told NBC News on Thursday that he was thinking about the Russia probe when he made the call to dismiss the man overseeing it. He added he had long ago decided Comey must go.

Both seemed to directly contradict the ways Trump's aides -- including Pence -- had been working to salvage the Comey storyline.

After Trump told NBC that he'd long planned to fire Comey -- and was not, as Pence declared seven times on Capitol Hill Wednesday, acting on the advice of his Justice Department -- the Vice President found himself again in a position of being contradicted by his boss.

""He's not rattled very often and he was a little rattled"" about how the events transpired, a senior administration adviser said.

According to this adviser, Trump made the decision to fire Comey -- and Pence knew the decision was coming before the announcement on Tuesday -- but he wasn't fully briefed on the President's reasoning for firing Comey before he went in front of cameras on Wednesday.

""He went out there without all the information,"" the adviser said. ""It was not an attempt to lie.""

Other advisers found themselves in similar positions. Briefing reporters at the same time Trump spoke in the East Room Friday, press secretary Sean Spicer struggled to explain multiple shifts in the timeline surrounding Comey's firing or the motivations behind it. Perhaps more worrisome, he wasn't able to say whether conversations in Trump's White House were being recorded -- a possibility Trump raised himself on Twitter Friday morning.

""The President has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer said.

Indeed, Trump himself told a Fox interviewer that he wouldn't talk about whether he'd recorded conversations with his canned FBI director.

In the public eye

Trump resumes a more robust public schedule starting Saturday. He'll deliver a commencement address at Liberty University, the evangelical institution in Lynchburg, Virginia. Next week he welcomes the leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Colombia for talks and delivers another graduation speech at the US Coast Guard academy in New London, Connecticut.

And he departs on a five-stop foreign swing on Friday, though the grueling pace of presidential foreign travel isn't likely to provide much relief for a beleaguered president.

For some aides, a departure from Washington can't come quickly around. Those around Trump are eager to get him out of the White House and outside of Washington as soon as possible, according to a source close to the White House. Trump generally basks in crowd settings, though he has traveled far less than his predecessors.

""We need to get the President outside the beltway,"" this source said.

'Meltdown mode'

Republican allies on Capitol Hill also hope the President can soon resume his push for key items of his legislative agenda, including a massive tax reform package that the White House promised in broad terms last month, but has since gotten little attention.

Trump's legislative affairs operation has largely gone quiet since the health care victory last week. On Tuesday, as senators hunkered down on Capitol Hill to hammer out their own version of the health bill, Trump was executing his plan to fire Comey; the news dominated conversations among lawmakers for the rest of the week.

When House Speaker Paul Ryan visited Ohio on Wednesday, he wanted to talk about tax reform. But headlines from his event largely focused on his refusal to comment about Comey's firing.

One Republican congressional source described the White House in ""meltdown mode"" as it scrambled to contain the Comey fallout.

Ryan himself worked to avoid the topic during an appearance in Wisconsin Friday.

""I'm going leave it to the President to talk about and defend his tweets,"" he said when asked about Trump's suggestion he may be recording his Oval Office meetings.

But Ryan seemed to acknowledge that, at least for the next four years, there will be little certainty coming from the White House.

He also said the FBI didn't lose faith in Comey

Washington (CNN) Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC'S Andrea Mitchell on Friday that there could be evidence of collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign -- a statement that comes on the heels of an apparent public threat Trump made this morning to fired FBI Director James Comey, tweeting that Comey had better hope their conversations have not been taped.

""There was no evidence that rose to that level, at that time, that found its way in to the intelligence community assessment, which we had pretty high confidence in,"" the former director of national intelligence said of collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russians, referring also to the US intelligence assessment that Russia tried to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump. ""That's not to say there wasn't evidence, but not that met that threshold.""

When asked whether the FBI's Russia investigation is fake news, or a ""witch hunt,"" as Trump called it this morning in another tweet, Clapper told MSNBC on Friday: ""I don't believe it is.""

""But that's kind of irrelevant,"" he continued. ""I think what needs to happen here is to clear this cloud, a cloud that's hanging over the administration, over the President, over the White House. It would be in everyone's best interest to get to the bottom of this, and for the country. Otherwise this is going to continue to linger as a dark cloud, in my opinion, over this administration.""

Clapper's remarks come after Trump tweeted that Clapper had said there is no collusion between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia.

16,Ransomware: World reels from massive cyberattack,"Organizations around the world were digging out this weekend from what experts are calling one of the biggest cyberattacks ever.

Hospitals, major companies and government offices were hit by a virus that seeks to seize control of computers until the victims pay a ransom.

Cybersecurity firm Avast said it had identified more than 75,000 ransomware attacks in 99 countries on Friday, making it one of the broadest and most damaging cyberattacks in history.

Avast said the majority of the attacks targeted Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan. But U.K. hospitals, Chinese universities and global firms like Fedex (FDX) also reported they had come under assault.

Security experts said the spread of the ransomware had been inadvertently stopped late Friday. The ransomware was designed to repeatedly contact an unregistered domain in its code. A 22-year-old security researcher in the U.K, who goes by MalwareTech, registered that domain to analyze the attack, but it turned out the ransomware needed it to remain unregistered to keep spreading.

""Thus by registering it we inadvertently stopped any subsequent infections,"" he told CNNTech.

However, a hacker could change the code to remove the domain and try the ransomware attack again.

It remained unclear how many organizations had already lost control of their data to the malicious software -- and researchers warned that copycat attacks could follow.

Europol said Saturday that the attack was of an ""unprecedented level and requires international investigation."" And the U.K. government called an emergency meeting over the crisis.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, at a meeting of world leaders in Italy, said the attack was a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity. ""It's a big priority of mine that we protect the financial infrastructure,"" he said.

The ransomware, called WannaCry, locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them. The exploit was leaked last month as part of a trove of NSA spy tools.

The ransomware is spread by taking advantage of a Windows vulnerability that Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) released a security patch for in March. But computers and networks that hadn't updated their systems were still at risk.

In the wake of the attack, Microsoft said it had taken the ""highly unusual step"" of releasing a patch for computers running older operating systems including Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003.

But the patches won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

""Affected machines have six hours to pay up and every few hours the ransom goes up,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, the principal security researcher at security firm Kaspersky Lab. ""Most folks that have paid up appear to have paid the initial $300 in the first few hours.""

On Saturday, experts said it appeared that the ransomware had made just over $20,000, although they expected that number to pop when people went back into the office Monday.

Related: 5 things to know about the attack

WannaCry has already caused massive disruption around the globe.

Sixteen National Health Service organizations in the UK were hit, and some of those hospitals canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible. The NHS said in a statement on Saturday that there was no evidence that patient information had been compromised.

In China, the internet security company Qihoo360 issued a ""red alert"" saying that a large number of colleges and students in the country had been affected by the ransomware, which is also referred to as WannaCrypt. State media reported that digital payment systems at PetroChina gas stations were offline, forcing customers to pay cash.

Related: NSA's powerful Windows hacking tools leaked online

""Global internet security has reached a moment of emergency,"" Qihoo360 warned.

Major global companies said they also came under attack.

Fedex said Friday it was ""experiencing interference with some of our Windows-based systems caused by malware"" and was trying to fix the problems as quickly as possible. Two big telecom companies, Telefónica (TEF) of Spain and Megafon of Russia, were also hit.

""This is turning into the biggest cybersecurity incident I've ever seen,"" U.K.-based security architect Kevin Beaumont said.

Russia's Interior Ministry released a statement Friday acknowledging a ransomware attack on its computers, adding that less than 1% of computers were affected, and that the virus was now ""localized"" and being destroyed.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in a statement late Friday, encouraged people to update their operating systems. ""We are actively sharing information related to this event and stand ready to lend technical support and assistance as needed to our partners, both in the United States and internationally,"" the department said.

Related: How leaked NSA spy tools created a hacking free-for-all

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, the attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion.

When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.

16,How to protect yourself from the massive ransomware attack,"It's on track to be one of the biggest recorded ransomware attacks ever, with tens of thousands of infected computers in nearly 100 countries.

Friday's attack largely hit businesses and large organizations: UK hospitals, a Spanish telecom, FedEx, the Russian Interior Ministry. But how much do individuals need to worry about their personal computers being targeted?

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that takes over a computer and locks the user out, preventing them from accessing any files until they pay money. This particular program, called WannaCry, asks for about $300, though the price increases over time.

WannaCry takes advantage of a Windows flaw discovered by the NSA and made public by hackers in April. Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) did release a patch for the vulnerability in March. But computers and networks that didn't update their systems were still at risk.

On Friday, a security researcher inadvertently created a ""kill switch"" to help stop the spread of this ransomware. However, a hacker could rewrite the code to omit the kill switch and start trying to infect new machines with a new version of it.

The worm is primarily impacting business, where it can spread quickly through a network to take down an entire company. Business take longer to install critical updates and patches, often to avoid impacting any legacy software they are running.

But individuals with PCs running Windows should still take a few precautions. First, install any software updates immediately and make it a regular habit. Turn on auto-updaters where available (Microsoft offers that option). Microsoft also recommends running its free anti-virus software for Windows.

If you don't already have a backup routine, start now and regularly save copies of all your files. That way if your machine gets infected and your photos and documents are encrypted, you don't need to worry about losing them.

Finally, always stay alert. Don't click on links that you don't recognize, or download files from people you don't know personally.

It's not just your computer that you need to be worried about. This attack has impacted many large services and organizations, including hospitals in England, a telecom and natural gas company in Spain, and FedEx. Basic services that impact your life could be impacted even while your own machines is clean.

Speaking at the Agnes Scott College commencement ceremony in Georgia on Saturday, Winfrey told the crowd that being ""full of herself"" propelled her career.

""I used to be afraid of that,"" she said. Winfrey added that people have criticized her for being ""full of herself,"" but now, Winfrey said she responds with: ""Yesss, I am. So full.""

Winfrey described ""full"" as being confident and self-aware -- and she said there's only one way to get there: ""You will get nowhere without a spiritual practice.""

""[That's] not necessarily religion. ... Maybe it's music, or dancing or just time for yourself to feed and nurture your own spirit,"" Winfrey explained.

Winfrey also talked about the importance of helping others.

She doesn't talk about her wildly lucrative ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" like a business venture. Rather, she emphasizes how she constantly viewed it as a form of service.

The goal, she explained, was to deliver compelling content that ""helped people better understand themselves.""

She said she conducted more than 37,000 interviews over 25 years on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" -- and they drew people in because she did more than just listen to people.

""I had to learn to feel with others, which is what it means to be compassionate,"" she said. ""I feel with you. It means not only am I able to walk in your shoes, my heart beats with yours. I see myself in you.""

Washington (CNN) In his first commencement speech as president, Donald Trump encouraged graduating seniors at Liberty University to draw lessons from his example as a political outsider, telling them to embrace being criticized at the end of a week during which he very much was.

Speaking before what the Christian university estimated were 50,000 graduates, Trump cast criticisms of his actions as a sign that he was doing honorable work in remarks that touched upon religion but were not particularly imbued with religious overtones.

""You aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you're right,"" the President told the crowd, to intermittent applause. ""We don't need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives.""

10,Global cyber-attack: Security blogger halts ransomware 'by accident',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero'

A UK security researcher has told the BBC how he ""accidentally"" halted the spread of the malicious ransomware that has affected hundreds of organisations, including the UK's NHS.

The 22-year-old man, known by the pseudonym MalwareTech, had taken a week off work, but decided to investigate the ransomware after hearing about the global cyber-attack.

He managed to bring the spread to a halt when he found what appeared to be a ""kill switch"" in the rogue software's code.

""It was actually partly accidental,"" he told the BBC, after spending the night investigating. ""I have not slept a wink.""

Although his discovery did not repair the damage done by the ransomware, it did stop it spreading to new computers, and he has been hailed an ""accidental hero"".

""I would say that's correct,"" he told the BBC.

""The attention has been slightly overwhelming. The boss gave me another week off to make up for this train-wreck of a vacation.""

What exactly did he discover?

The researcher first noticed that the malware was trying to contact a specific web address every time it infected a new computer.

But the web address it was trying to contact - iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com - had not been registered.

MalwareTech decided to register it, and bought it for $10.69 (£8). Owning it would let him see where computers were accessing it from, and give him an idea of how widespread the ransomware was.

Image copyright MalwareTech Image caption Owning the web address let MalwareTech monitor where infections were happening

But by doing so he triggered part of the ransomware's code that told it to continuing spreading as long as the website iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com did not exist.

This type of code is known as a ""kill switch"", which some attackers use to halt the spread of their software if things get out of hand.

He tested his theory and was delighted when he managed to trigger the ransomware on demand.

""Now you probably can't picture a grown man jumping around with the excitement of having just been 'ransomwared', but this was me,"" he said in a blog post.

MalwareTech now thinks the code was originally designed to thwart researchers trying to investigate the ransomware, but it backfired by letting them remotely disable it.

Does this mean the ransomware is defeated?

While the registration of the web address appears to have stopped one strain of the ransomware spreading from device-to-device, it does not repair computers that are already infected.

Security experts have also warned that new variants of the malware that ignore the ""kill switch"" will appear.

""This variant shouldn't be spreading any further, however there'll almost certainly be copycats,"" said security researcher Troy Hunt in a blog post.

MalwareTech warned: ""We have stopped this one, but there will be another one coming and it will not be stoppable by us.

""There's a lot of money in this, there is no reason for them to stop. It's not much effort for them to change the code and start over.""",bbc-news
3,Pope Francis canonises two children at Portugal's Fatima shrine,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pope Francis makes saints of Portuguese shepherd children

Pope Francis was greeted by crowds of hundreds of thousands as he made saints of two shepherd children at the Fatima shrine complex in Portugal.

""We declare the blissful Francisco Marto and Jacinta Marto saints,"" the pontiff said to loud applause.

It is 100 years since the two - and a third child - reported seeing the Virgin Mary while tending sheep. The third is also on the way to sainthood.

Portugal boosted security and re-imposed border controls temporarily.

Some 500,000 worshippers gathered in the town of Fatima, north of Lisbon, for the ceremony on Saturday, the Vatican said in a statement.

Roman Catholic pilgrims converged on the Fatima Sanctuary from countries as far away as China, Venezuela and East Timor.

The town's local bishop first read out the request for the two ""little shepherds"" to be canonised before the Pope declared them both saints of the Catholic Church.

Earlier on Saturday, the official Twitter account of the Pope posted a message with reference to the Virgin Mary.

""Whenever we look to Mary, we come to believe once again in the revolutionary nature of love and tenderness,"" it said.

The pontiff also met Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa for a private meeting ahead of the ceremony.

Plea for harmony

On Friday, Pope Francis flew into Fatima in a helicopter and travelled through the town in his ""Popemobile"".

At a candle-lit vigil he called for harmony between all people at the Chapel of the Apparitions and spoke of wars ""tearing our world apart"".

The chapel is built on the very spot where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Devotees took part in the candle-lit procession

Two of the children - Jacinta and Francisco Marto - have been canonised for the miracles attributed to them. They died in the 1918-1919 European influenza pandemic.

The so-called three secrets of Fatima were written down by their cousin, Lucia dos Santos, who died in 2005 aged 97. The beatification process for her began in 2008.

The Church attaches great value to their visions, as Mary is believed to have revealed truths to help mankind. The Church says the first vision came on 13 May 1917.

In a video message to the people of Portugal, the Pope said he was going to present himself to Mary ""and I need to feel you close, physically and spiritually, so that we are one heart and one mind"".

Image copyright AFP Image caption The three shepherd children who had visions of the Virgin Mary in Fatima (L-R: Lucia, Francisco, Jacinta)

What are the three secrets?

They are prophecies written down by Lucia, years after the apparitions that the three said they had witnessed. She spent her adult life as a nun at a convent in Coimbra.

The first two secrets in Lucia's account were revealed in 1942.

The first described a terrifying vision of hell, with a ""great sea of fire"", demons and human souls

The second is interpreted as Mary's prediction that World War One would end and that World War Two would start during the papacy of Pius XI

Mary also called for the ""consecration"" of Russia, saying: ""If my requests are heeded, Russia will be converted, and there will be peace; if not, she will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church""

Lucia sealed the third secret in an envelope, which was handed to the Vatican in 1957 and only revealed in 2000

It described an angel demanding ""penance!"", then the Pope and other clergy climbing a mountain, only to be killed by soldiers firing bullets and arrows.

What does the Vatican say about them?

According to Pope Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, the visions described in the three secrets are ""meant to mobilise the forces of change in the right direction"".

They are not like the Bible - a text he describes as a ""public revelation"".

The Fatima visions are ""private revelations"", he writes. Their purpose is ""to help live more fully"" in accordance with Christ's teaching.

The late Pope John Paul II was shot by a Turkish gunman on 13 May 1981.

He believed that his survival was due to Mary's divine intervention, and that the third secret had predicted the attack on him.

John Paul donated the bullet to Fatima, and it was inserted into the crown adorning a statue of Mary there.

What about Pope Francis's visit?

He follows John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who also made pilgrimages to the Fatima Sanctuary.

Security was high at the site, with Portugal deploying 6,000 police and emergency workers. Concrete blocks were placed on approach roads, to stop any terrorist ""ramming"" attack with a vehicle.

Only nine border crossings remained open, with systematic checks, as Portugal temporarily suspended the Schengen open borders pact.

Battery life is one (waking) day

The cheapest Apple Watch on sale today is the original iWatch, the company’s first smartwatch that came out in April 2015. No, the Apple Store doesn’t sell this price-reduced Apple Watch 1 anymore, but there are plenty of retailers still hawking the original Apple Watch at a discount. The best part – besides the cheap Apple Watch 1 price – is the fact that it runs watchOS 3 with all the same apps as an Apple Watch 2. It’s a vast improvement over the launch software.

10,Google's Project Treble will actually let you experience the latest Android updates,"Google’s new Project Treble is set to speed up the time it takes for your phone to get access to Android O, the upcoming release that’s now confirmed for Summer.



Traditionally, if you buy a phone that’s not made by Google, you run the risk of waiting weeks, months, or even years for it to be updated to the latest and greatest operating system available.



This changes that, or so Google says, with Treble being its “biggest change yet to low-level system architecture.” In a nutshell, Google’s work here is to make it easier for manufacturers to push the new software that you so desire to your phone, cutting down on the time and money requirements that were previously necessary.



Posted in the Android developers blog , the big difference that will help speed things along for your preferred device maker is that Google is pushing for phones released moving forward to feature vendor implementation, part of the greater Android architecture, that won’t need to be updated with each new OS release.



According to the post, it’s the interface that gives developers access to “hardware-specific features of Android.” With these changes in place, manufacturers will have far fewer things to rework with the next major update.

10,Tesla's new moonshot is solar energy — here's why it might just work,"Tesla is a powerhouse in the modern tech world, and for good reason. The company's push for electric cars has captivated consumers, investors and industry observers, and the result is that Tesla is now the most valuable American car company . CEO Elon Musk has even set his sights on overtaking Apple one day in terms of company worth.

More recently, Tesla's focus has broadened, and it's made a different kind of push, one that aims to capture energy from the sun and use it to power people's homes.

The move makes sense. Tesla isn't just a car manufacturer; it's a multi-pronged company aiming for unseen heights in renewable energy. Tesla wants to radically transform how we access and use energy in our everyday lives, and to that end it's spearheading two different products: solar panels and solar roof tiles, also known as the Tesla Solar Roof.

Tesla's solar products are remarkably different than what we're used to seeing. Not only are the designs sleeker than traditional solar panels, but Tesla claims they are also cheaper, and that's before the savings you can expect on your power bill.

There are, of course, plenty of questions. How does Tesla plan to implement this new wave of solar power products? Is its technology really cheaper and more effective than traditional solar panels? Can Tesla pull off completely transforming home energy consumption, forever?

Tesla and solar energy: a brief history

Tesla's mission in solar and beyond is clear: the company wants to re-imagine how we consume energy. You might not know, however, that this plan actually isn't new.

In the 'Secret Tesla Motors Plan (just between you and me),' a blog post written in 2006, Musk described his grand vision to transform Tesla into more than a car company.

""...the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution,"" wrote Musk.

Tesla started laying the groundwork for that transformation long before it announced any solar panel. Critical to using green energy is the ability to store it, and Tesla came up with a way to do just that in the Powerwall. First announced in 2015, the Tesla Powerwall serves as a battery to store energy captured by solar panels and tiles.

Tesla Powerwall battery

The Powerwall stores energy collected from a solar roof or tiles, and even from the electric grid. The stored energy can be used to power a home when there's no sunlight, or when the cost of electricity is higher, such as during the early evening hours.

While the original Powerwall came at a cost of $3,000 or more, the new and improved Powerwall 2 starts at $5,500, largely because it includes a built-in power inverter.

This means the unit will convert captured energy from the sun into energy that can actually be used in your home. Previously, you would had to buy an inverter separately.

With its Powerwall in place, Tesla took an even bigger step in becoming a solar power powerhouse in August 2016 when it purchased SolarCity for $2.6 billion. Founded by Elon Musk's cousin, Lyndon Rive, SolarCity specializes in the installation and development of solar panels. The SolarCity acquisition was a huge deal for Tesla; with SolarCity under its wing, Tesla can deploy full solar systems, complete with solar roofs, batteries, and so on.

Catching rays

Part of the appeal of Tesla's solar solutions are how aesthetically appealing they are: they are sleek, modern-looking, and blend in seamlessly. Tesla proved energy efficiency doesn't have to come at the cost of curb appeal with the Model S and Model X, and it's doing so again with its solar tech.

It's important to reiterate that Tesla has two solar products right now: its more traditional solar panels and the Solar Roof, which looks like standard (yet beautiful) roof shingles, but serve as both roofing and solar panels.

But looks will only take you so far, and Tesla has made its solar solutions functional, too.

The technology used in its tiles is a new form of solar technology, and thus a bit of a change for Tesla.

When Tesla first launched the Model S, it did so using a slew of existing technologies and battery cells built by Panasonic. With its solar tiles, Tesla has tapped a new technology built by Silevo, a company that was acquired by SolarCity for $200 million in 2014. That technology, however, is still somewhat new, and it's unproven in large-scale manufacturing, according to a report from The Buffalo News . So, while the technology works in the lab, it's still unclear if it can be as efficient on a larger scale.

Look just like shingles, right?

The tiles essentially incorporate different layers — a layer of glass on the top, then layers of various films, then solar cells, which convert light into electricity. Silevo technology uses what's called a ""heterojunction cell,"" and while the details of the technology get technical, the point is this: Silevo tech could offer an efficiency of up to 22%, which is greater than averages of between 10% and 15% more traditional panels achieve.

There are still a few things that are a unclear about Tesla's tiles at this point, however. Tesla is expected to use both Silevo and Panasonic technology in its solar products, but these will need to prove they can work considering Silevo is still considered somewhat experimental.

It also appears as though Tesla has taken a step back from Silevo because of its partnership with Panasonic as well, but that doesn't mean it's ditching the tech altogether. Instead, it's likely the technology just needs some more development to be effective on a mass scale.

Tesla's solar panels

Meanwhile, Tesla's solar panels, announced in April 2017, are different than the solar tiles. They look more like traditional panels, albeit sleeker. This is thanks to a much lower profile than other solar panel offerings, making them not as immediately noticeable.

According to Tesla, the panels ""exceed industry standards for durability and lifespan."" The panels aren't actually built by Tesla, but rather by Panasonic, which are then re-sold by Tesla. These don't use the Silevo technology found in the tiles.

'Plug it in and use it'

In addition to a pleasing design, experts argue the intelligence of Tesla's software combined with its Powerwall home batteries will be the real draw to home owners.

Tesla has revealed little about the software behind Powerwall, but on the consumer level it can monitor energy usage in real-time and features intelligence that allows it to automatically adjust its settings according to your usage needs and daily routine. While you don't necessarily need a Powerwall, it helps Tesla solar users get the most out of their panels or tiles.

""Tesla is using existing off-the-shelf battery technology [lithium ion] but bundles its very tech-smart information systems design to make storage just as easy as solar,"" Daniel Kammen, Professor of Energy at the University of California, Berkeley, tells TechRadar. In other words, solar energy is already easy, and Tesla makes storing it just as simple.

""Plug it in and use it,"" Kammen said.

This end-to-end package isn't something other solar companies seem to have mastered: they don't use solar to its full potential, and all the energy captured during the day can't be used at night without a decent battery. With Powerwall, Tesla is delivering a holistic solution to consumers.

Real solar savings?

While solar energy in general saves money on electric bills, it's still expensive to install, so you may not feel like you've saved money for quite some time if you go Tesla's route. Still, the company argues that eventually you will see worthwhile savings on energy use.

According to Tesla, the real savings are to be found in its Solar Roof. And we’re not just talking the cost of the tiles compared to other solar products: Musk said during an earnings call in November that installing its roof is cheaper than installing standard roof tiles. And that's before the money you save from the energy it generates.

""Electricity,"" Musk said, ""is just a bonus.""

Electricity is just a bonus Tesla CEO Elon Musk

But is this claim of cheaper costs true? Well, it's complicated. According to Musk, the solar tiles are cheaper than the cost of concrete or ceramic roof tiles. Those, however, are among the more expensive roof tiles out there, running between $400 and $2,000 per 100 square feet, according to The Motley Fool .

So while Tesla's roofing may end up being cheaper than some traditional materials, it will only be cheaper than the more expensive traditional materials.

Tesla unveiled pricing for its Solar Roof earlier this week, so we can helpfully run the numbers. On average, a Solar Roof will cost $21.85 per square foot for a 3,000-square-foot roof, although that pricing depends on factors like location and the ratio of solar to non-solar tiles you purchase.

Here's what you'll see when Tesla spits out your Solar Roof estimate

Because pricing varies home-to-home, Tesla launched an online calculator to figure out price estimates.

For this story, we plugged in a 3,000-foot-square roof in Sunnyvale, California, and received a roof installation estimate of $79,500, plus $7,000 for the Tesla Powerwall. Undoubtedly that's a lot of money, but for the materials used and the type of roof you're getting, it's actually around the same price as a non-solar roof.

According to Consumer Reports , a traditional Slate Tile roof would cost around $98,500 to install on a 3,000-foot-square roof, making it more expensive than the $79,500 Textured or Smooth Glass roof we calculated for our fictional Sunnyvale home.

What's more, you start saving after the initial install. In California, you would get a $21,000 tax credit for installing such a roof, and Tesla says the roof would generate $113,900 of energy over the next 30 years. At the end of the 30 years, you will have paid off your roof, and generated an extra $48,400 worth of energy. In the long run, your solar roof would cost zero dollars, and you could even make money from it by selling the extra energy.

An important part of Tesla's equation is the ratio of solar tiles to non-solar tiles. Tesla's roofing is actually built from a combination of solar and non-solar tiles, and you can adjust the ratio you want installed. Using fewer solar tiles and more non-solar tiles will result in a cheaper installation cost, but less energy generated.

Tesla's solar tiles are, at least on paper, worth it the investment, even if you weren't thinking of getting a more expensive slate glass roof. Traditional roofing simply can't generate money, and will only cost you in repairs and replacements. Even cheaper asphalt tile roofing, which costs around $20,000 to install on a 3,000-foot-square roof, will cost you more money over time.

And what about the more traditional Panasonic-made solar panels Tesla recently unveiled? Are they more affordable and cost effective than other panels? Unfortunately, we can’t know yet as Tesla hasn't announced pricing for its panels.

We can do a bit of sleuthing, however. Solar Power Authority , which offers quotes for panels, says the average cost of solar panels is around $5-$6 per watt including installation. That puts a 5kW system between $25,000 and $30,000.

Tesla’s Panasonic modules each offer 325 watts, so each module should sit between $1,625 and $1,950. They likely won’t be sold by individual modules, but any less than that would be considered a good price to pay.

Tesla solar takes flight

Tesla is still working on its solar products, and in fact only two of its four solar tile options are available this year, with the others arriving in 2018. The two up for pre-order now are Textured Glass and Smooth Glass, and next year will see Slate Glass and Tuscan Glass.

Tesla's venture into solar may still be in the early stages, but already it's poised to be an influential player in the renewable energy world, helped by unique products, a respected business model and name recognition.

""Tesla has both a fantastic technology solution that is available right now, and a great brand and market research,"" said UC Berkeley's Kammen. ""This is a powerful combination.""

The big question now is whether home owners actually buy a Tesla Solar Roof or panels. Residential solar is on the rise in the US, but while 2016 was the market's biggest year to date, the number of residential solar installations in the country still only totals somewhere above one million, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The climb to widespread residential solar adoption is steep, but with Tesla joining the fray, more homeowners may now consider switching to solar, whether for the installation price, long-term savings, to be an early adopter, or all of the above.

What is clear is Tesla is serious about solar, and we expect to learn about improvements in the technology, cheaper pricing and even more energy products in the months and years to come.",techradar
6,"Trump tells Liberty graduates to challenge elites, critics","President Trump (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)

Capping a week of turmoil over his firing of FBI Director James Comey, President Trump told a crowd of college graduates Saturday they should not be afraid to challenge the establishment or government elites who would second-guess whatever they do.

""Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the same courage,"" Trump said at a commencement speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va.

In an implied blast at his critics, Trump told the Liberty graduates that ""Washington is run by a small group with failed values who think they know everything — we don’t need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives.""

Trump did not specifically mention Comey or other political disputes that have marked his first four months in office, but made repeated general references to his maverick campaign and presidency.

Read more:

At one point, Trump said, ""in my short time in Washington, I've seen first-hand how the system is broken."" At another, he told students and parents at the conservative religious school that ""nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic.""

Trump also praised the military for its battle against the Islamic State and referred at one point to his recent executive order on religious freedom.

Speaking at school that bills itself as the world's largest Christian university, Trump made repeated references to God and the role of faith in society. ""We don’t worship Washington,"" he said. ""We worship God.”

The president also engaged in more traditional commencement rhetoric, congratulating the graduates on their accomplishments and lauding the school's academic credentials and football program. Trump praised the Liberty evangelical community for its political activism, and cited the large support of religious conservatives for his campaign.

""What will you give back to this country and indeed to the world?"" Trump asked the graduates.

Earlier, during the Air Force One ride to southwestern Virginia, Trump told reporters that ""we can make a fast decision"" on a new FBI director, possibly before his departure Friday on a trip to the Middle East and Europe. Trump said he and his staff are looking at ""very well known, highly respected, really talented people, and that's what we want for the FBI.""

Among the names under consideration to be interviewed Saturday, according to a source familiar with the process who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations: Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, former Justice Department Criminal Division Chief Alice Fisher and New York state judge and former U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia.

The search takes place amid an ongoing firestorm over Trump's dismissal of Comey and new questions over whether he taped conversations with the now-former FBI director.

In a Friday tweet, Trump said Comey ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Since that comment, neither Trump nor his aides would confirm or deny questions about whether he in fact tapes conversations.

""I won't talk about that,"" Trump told Fox News in an interview. ""All I want is for Comey to be honest and I hope he will be and I'm sure he will be, I hope.""

Trump, angry over media coverage on the Comey issue, has also threatened to end White House news briefings.

Democrats, and some FBI officials, charge Trump got rid of Comey in order to impede an investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia, which tried to influence the 2016 election by hacking prominent Democrats.

In a commencement address of her own, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, told University of Massachusetts-Amherst graduates they should fight for “the principle that no one, no one in this country is above the law and we need a Justice Department, not an obstruction of justice department.”

Trump has denounced the Russian investigation as a ""hoax"" and ""witch hunt.""

During the commencement address at Liberty's football stadium, Trump lauded students and parents for being ""Champions for Christ."" Saying that ""there may very well be a president or two in our midst,"" Trump encouraged young people to get involved in public life and persevere in the face of criticism.

""A small group of failed voices, who think they know everything, and understand everyone, want to tell everybody else how to live and what to do and how to think,"" Trump said. ""But you aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you are right.""

6,"Michelle Obama slams Trump school lunch rollback, says kids will eat 'crap'","Former first lady Michelle Obama talks with Sam Kass, former White House chef and nutrition adviser. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)

A fired-up Michelle Obama is defending the nutrition programs she advanced as first lady, saying something is ""wrong"" when the government doesn't want kids to eat healthy meals.

In a speech Friday to the Partnerships for a Healthier America conference, Obama did not mention Trump by name but took issue with changes his administration announced last week to ease some of the school nutrition standards she advanced.

""We gotta make sure we don't let anybody take us back,"" the former first lady said. ""You have to stop and think, why don't you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you? And why is that a partisan issue?""

""Take me out of the equation — like me or don't like me,"" she added. ""But think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap. Why would you celebrate that? Why would you sit idly and be okay with that? Because here's the secret: If somebody is doing that, they don't care about your kid.""

The comments marked the first time Obama has weighed in on the Trump administration's changes to the nutrition policies she helped champion.

On May 1, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the changes, which ease rules on whole grains required in school lunch meals and delay a requirement for further reductions in sodium.

Perdue said the changes were needed to give local programs more flexibility to provide meals that children want to eat.

""If kids aren't eating the food, and it's ending up in the trash, they aren't getting any nutrition,"" he said in a statement announcing the rollbacks.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Silencing people with differing opinions has become a pattern on college campuses.

The most recent instance was at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, where Betsy DeVos faced a barrage of non-stop boos during her commencement speech Wednesday. During the Education Secretary's entire 20-minute speech and any time her name was mentioned, the audience heckled her, some screaming ""get the [expletive] out"" and ""shut the [expletive] up."" Angered by her past remarks that historically black schools are the ""real pioneers when it comes to school choice,"" graduates turned their backs to the stage and raised their fists to the ceiling.

""Let’s choose to hear one another out,” DeVos said in a failed attempt to persuade the crowd. “I am here to demonstrate in the most direct way possible that I and the administration are fully committed to your success and to the success of every student across this great country.”

University President Edison Jackson interrupted DeVos at one point and threatened to mail the graduates their degrees if they didn't stop. DeVos sympathizers scolded the students for showing disrespect.

But experts say that was the whole point.

""The whole purpose of protest is to be rude,"" said Pamela Oliver, professor of sociology at University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""It's not like they hadn’t warned the college that they (the students) were upset about it.""

While Oliver considered the protest pretty tame — ""its noisy, but it's not the black bloc, they're not out breaking windows or throwing blocks"" — that isn't always the case.

Protesters at Middlebury College in Vermont vandalized a car and injured a professor when Charles Murray, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist, came to speak in March. Protests against Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos' visit to University of California-Davis ended with one man shot.

At schools across the nation, students have jeered commencement speakers and college visitors they don't agree with — in some cases, blocking them from campus completely.

Students argue that they are just exercising their freedom of speech. But experts say, sometimes the protests go too far, tiptoeing the line between free speech and civil disobedience, which can be punishable by law.

""People get confused. Of course it's not free speech to stop speech,"" said James Weinstein, a professor of constitutional law at Arizona State University. ""Now, that might be civil disobedience. If some neo-Nazi was coming to campus to advocate for the re-enslavement of blacks and extermination of Jews, and you wanted to stop that — is that a matter of civil disobedience? We could have that discussion, but it's certainly not free speech.""

Quashing events with controversial speakers, as was the case at the University of California-Berkeley where conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of a speaking engagement in April, also hampers productive conversations, he added. If we don't listen to each other, Weinstein warned, things are only going to get worse in an already divided time in history.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The choice of DeVos sparked immediate backlash last week among many students and alumni of the Florida university, who signed a petition asking the school to rescind her invitation Time

""I think there's a line between legitimate protest and shutting down an event,"" said Weinstein. ""It isn’t proper for them to try and stop the presentation of ideas that they find offensive or evil, and it certainly isn't promoting free speech.

""It's no more free speech to stop an event than to throw a smoke bomb in the place.""

Harold Pollack, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, agreed there's a fine line between protesting and preventing speakers from being heard.

“If they invited a Holocaust denier to the University of Chicago, I would turn my back on that person, boo them, but I wouldn’t prevent them from speaking,” Pollack said. “From a strategic point of view, the stupidest thing you can do is elevate these figures. The focus is on the misbehavior of those protesting, rather than the low quality of the ideas [the speaker] has to offer in public debate.""

Do controversial figures have a right to speak at public universities?

Milo Yiannopoulous' speech at UC-Berkeley canceled as protest turns violent

Even speakers who spew what some consider hate speech have the right to speak, argued Weinstein.

Truman State University in Missouri came under fire in April for inviting Robert Spencer, who runs the conservative website ""Jihad Watch"" and has been classified as a an extremist and anti-Muslim propagandist. It was the same story at Texas A&M when Richard Spencer, who's considered one of the founders of the alt-right movement and a white supremacist, spoke on campus.

""In this country, that kind of speech is legal. We have no hate speech exception in the first amendment,"" said Weinstein. ""Even stopping the most virulent Nazi on campus isn’t free speech; it is civil disobedience.""

But simply booing speakers, as was the case at Bethune-Cookman — although students and alumni did petition school administration to dis-invite her — is usually well within the rights of protesting.

Bethune-Cookman alumnus and current vice president of the American Federation of Teachers Fedrick Ingram, who protested DeVos' visit, was proud of his fellow B-CU Wildcats.

""In the spirit of Mary McLeod Bethune (the school's founder and civil rights activist), I wouldn't expect anything less,"" said Ingram after the ceremony. ""We should never squelch a collective voice of people trying to do the right thing.""

The NAACP has since called for the firing of President Jackson and Chairman of the Board Joe Petrock, who said they hoped the event could be a teachable moment, for inviting DeVos in the first place.

College students have a long history of protesting commencement speakers they don't agree with. Dating back to the 80s, students have challenged the likes of Sen. Rick Santorum, First Lady Barbara Bush, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie, Sen. John McCain, Vice President Dick Cheney and President Barack Obama.

New legislation could change that. In Illinois, Tennessee, Colorado and Arizona, a bill that would prevent colleges and universities from dis-inviting speakers and force them penalize students who obstruct such events is picking up steam.

""Loudly booing, being rude to people, signs with obnoxious pictures or caricatures of Trump or people you disagree with is a long tradition of American protest,” said Pollack.

Buying your first home has always been a sign of growing up and living the American dream.

But the rising cost of housing in many areas have put desirable large cities out of reach for potential homebuyers in their 20s and 30s as they contend with student loan debt and saving for a down payment.

“As Millennials reach the typical home buying age, they are coming into a tough housing market with low inventory and lots of competition,” said Zillow chief economist Svenja Gudell.So where can young Americans actually afford to buy a house?

Most of the best cities for first-time homebuyers are in the Southeast or Midwest, according to a study of the top 35 metropolitan areas by online real estate database firm Zillow.

Topping the list are two cities in Florida: Orlando and Tampa. Rounding out the top 5: Indianapolis, Las Vegas and San Antonio.

These markets were cited for having affordable homes, healthy inventory and stronger home value growth potential.

The most difficult areas for first-time buyers, not surprisingly, are West Coast markets.

A 5% down payment for a house in the San Francisco area would be larger than a 20% down payment in most of the top 10 best markets, the study found.

A separate report by Bankrate cited California as the toughest state for first-time homebuyers. Hawaii and New York came in second and third.

“Tight market conditions and unaffordably high prices really plague what many young Americans feel are the most desirable places to put down roots,” Bankrate.com analyst Claes Bell said in the study.

The best states: Iowa, Utah and Minnesota.

The biggest barrier to homeownership is saving for a down payment .

Seven of the top 10 metropolitan markets cited as the best by Zillow have a median home value that is lower than the national median home value of $196,500. That means they require less money for an acceptable down payment.

Here are the top ten best markets for first-time homebuyers and Zillow’s home value index for each:

1. Orlando, Fla.: $202,900

2. Tampa, Fla.: $183,300

3. Indianapolis, Ind.: $137,300

4. Las Vegas, Nev.: $219,200

9,Phil Jackson standing by parting shots for Carmelo,"Knicks president Phil Jackson (Photo: Julie Jacobson, AP)

One day after the Knicks expressed their optimism that Kristaps Porzingis would be back with the team next season team president Phil Jackson reiterated his desire to move Carmelo Anthony.

Jackson, speaking to reporters in Chicago at the NBA Draft Combine, would not discuss the rift between the team and Porzingis which came to a head with the 21-year-old franchise building block blowing off his exit interview with Jackson. But he defended his words from his own end of season press conference which drew a rebuke from the players association.

Last month Jackson spoke about his desire to trade Anthony, admitting it was best for the Knicks and explaining how he told Anthony that it would be better for him, too. Asked Friday if he thought Anthony could return to New York next season, he didn’t back off.

""He has a no trade contract,” Jackson said. “I think I expressed what I felt. I can't express it any better. I thought it was well-said, even though a lot of you didn't feel quite that way. But we'd like him to have success, the opportunity is narrowing. We'd just like him to have success somewhere. We're not going to be there. Hopefully we'll be maybe a playoff team next year. It would be tough to consider us possible champions.”

That’s realistic, although not exactly optimistic for Knicks fans. Jackson said that he hadn’t spoken to Anthony since the exit interview, although he said that he had texted him and general manager Steve Mills did convey the team’s support when reports surfaced that Anthony’s marriage was in trouble.

“I’ve reached out to him in a text but not personally,” Jackson said. “Some personal things came out in the paper that was difficult. Wanted him to know we’re supportive of him.’’

Jackson told reporters that he spoke with NBA commissioner Adam Silver after the players association’s executive director Michele Roberts complained and that they were on the same page.

“To have a positive base to work from is really important, and our fan core is positive, and we like to give them hope because they’ve been disappointed,’’ Jackson said. “They weren’t disappointed 20 years ago when they went to The Finals. They were surprised in ’99. So it’s been a long time for hope for our fans. We want them to have hope. They’ve been bridesmaids but never a bride.”

While Knicks’ coach Jeff Hornacek spoke about Porzingis Thursday with reporters, Jackson would not continue the discussion.

“Rather than to bat this thing over the net back and forth between parties we’ll just leave it alone,” Jackson said. “Jeff said something yesterday and kind of expressed our feelings on it.”

9,Daniel Cormier vs. Jon Jones 2 headlines UFC 214 but Jimi Manuwa will serve as backup | FOX Sports,"DALLAS — For months, UFC president Dana White has promised that when Jon Jones booked his next fight, the former light heavyweight champion would not compete in a main event.

White’s stance came from Jones being pulled from UFC 200 last July after he tested positive for a banned substance, which happened just over a year after he was yanked from another event due to a hit-and-run accident that ultimately cost him the light heavyweight title.

Despite his guarantee that Jones wouldn’t headline his next fight, White has apparently had a change of heart.

On Thursday, White confirmed to FOX Sports’ Andy Nesbitt that Jones would face current light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier in the main event for UFC 214 on July 29 in Anaheim.

“D.C. and Jon Jones will be the main event,” White said. “I’m bringing in [Jimi] Manuwa to fight on the undercard there so if anything happens, Jimi Manuwa will be ready to go and step in for somebody falling out if that happens.”

There is a condition attached to Cormier and Jones headlining the upcoming card in July.

White said that top five ranked light heavyweight slugger Jimi Manuwa would also be booked on the UFC 214 card in case either Jones or Cormier are unable to compete.

There’s no word yet on who Manuwa would face, but he has been asking for a showdown with former champion Mauricio “Shogun” Rua on the card.

As of now, nothing is set other than Manuwa being booked for the same card as Cormier vs. Jones to ensure the main event will move forward even if one of the fighters is forced out of the fight at the last minute.

9,Kasper Schmeichel rips referees after Man City's vital win vs. Leicester | FOX Sports,"Kasper Schmeichel was not a happy man following Leicester City’s controversial loss to Manchester City on Saturday. The Foxes’ goalkeeper questioned referee Bobby Madley and his officiating crew’s decision-making and consistency following the 2-1 loss at the Etihad.

City’s first goal in the 29th minute came after Leroy Sane’s cutback pass into the box found David Silva, who slotted it to Schmeichel’s far post. Teammate Raheem Sterling, who was offside, swung a leg at it but didn’t touch it and the goal was allowed to stand. That’s where Schmeichel first took issue with the officiating after the match, via SkySports.

“The first goal is offside. Anybody who has played football, especially in goal, will know it’s offside. If he’s in the six-yard box and the ball is going by him, past my line of sight, that means he’s interfering. It doesn’t even matter if he goes for it, he’s interfering because I can’t see the ball. “Fuchs can’t get to the ball because he’s stood in the way of him and prevents him from swinging his foot at the ball. Then he swings his foot at the ball, so he’s made an attempt. So three times he’s offside. It’s one of these very frustrating decisions because we’d done well up until then and we kind of lost our composure for five or 10 minutes and they got the second one.”

The Foxes also had a late penalty disallowed, as Riyad Mahrez slipped during the attempt and sent a shot that deflected off his plant foot into the Manchester City net. Madley saw the double-touch and rightly disallowed the goal, but Schmeichel bemoaned the lack of consistency among referees. The Danish keeper cited Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann’s penalty against Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals, where a double touch also took place but wasn’t noticed.

“Griezmann did it in the semi-final and it stood, so you talk about consistency,” he told SkySports. That penalty would have equalized the match in the 77th minute, but Madley waved it off.

The result doesn’t mean much for Leicester on the whole, but it’s a massive result for Man City and the other Premier League teams in the hunt for a top-four spot. A full three points put the Citizens in third place with 72 points, two above Liverpool in the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot. It increased the distance between City and Arsenal, too, who entered the day on 66 points prior to their match against Stoke.

Schmeichel’s comments will likely fall on deaf ears, as referees and officials rarely comment after matches, but he can rest assured that plenty of people are on his side — Man City’s rivals chief among them.",fox-sports
9,Gareth Bale still hasn't returned to training as injury could keep him out from trophy chases | FOX Sports,"Gareth Bale still isn’t training with the team, Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane revealed on Saturday. The update comes as the Merengues get ready for what Zidane has called “four finals” in pursuit of La Liga and Champions League crowns.

“We have to see day to day with Gareth Bale,” he told reporters at a news conference. “He is continuing in the gym, working, trying to get rid of his discomfort.

“It’s getting better, but you have to go day by day. But he’s not even training with us. I cannot tell you when he will return, but hopefully it is soon.”

Bale hurt his calf in Real Madrid’s Champions League quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich. The injury wasn’t called season-ending at the time, but it’s looking like it could be now.

Real Madrid have three La Liga matches in the next two weeks, and if they win all three then they will win the league crown. Then on June 3, the Merengues have the Champions League final, where they will attempt to be the first team to win the tournament in consecutive seasons.

That timeline leaves Bale three weeks to get healthy enough to play. That’s not very long for a player who still can’t train with the rest of the team, and now it’s starting to look possible that he doesn’t see the field again this season. That would mean Real Madrid playing their “four finals” without him as they chase two trophies.

9,Phil Jackson reiterates Knicks' desire to trade Carmelo Anthony | FOX Sports,"When Phil Jackson met with reporters at the end of the regular season, he made it clear that the Knicks want to move on from Carmelo Anthony by trading him this summer. His comments drew the ire of the union for the players, and they earned a pretty funny response from Anthony himself.

Melo has a no-trade clause, of course, so Jackson’s rhetoric is ultimately meaningless unless the player agrees to be dealt to a different destination. But despite the warning from National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts, and despite the fact that Jackson is powerless in this situation without Anthony’s blessing, he chose to double down on his earlier remarks.

“He has a no trade contract,” Jackson told reporters at the NBA Draft Combine in Chicago, when asked if he wanted Anthony back with the Knicks next season. “I think I expressed what I felt. I can’t express it any better. I thought it was well-said, even though a lot of you didn’t feel quite that way. But we’d like him to have success, the opportunity is narrowing. We’d just like him to have success somewhere. We’re not going to be there. Hopefully we’ll be maybe a playoff team next year. It would be tough to consider us possible champions.”

Anthony is under contract for two more seasons, but has an early termination option for the final year of his deal that would allow him to become an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2018. If Jackson continues to make things uncomfortable in New York, and if he can orchestrate a trade that would send Melo to a contender, it’s at least possible that Anthony would consider leaving under these circumstances.

But all Jackson is doing by continuing to talk about this is lowering Anthony’s value in any potential trade package.",fox-sports

6,Ex-Justice Department officials call for independent counsel in Russia probe,"Former FBI Director James Comey (Photo: Cliff Owen, AP)

A bipartisan group of 179 former federal prosecutors is calling on the Justice Department to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, following President Trump's abrupt firing this week of James Comey as FBI director.

In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the former prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York called Comey a ""highly professional and ethical person."" They said his firing has ""the appearance — if not the reality — of interfering"" with the FBI's ongoing probe into whether Trump's campaign associates colluded with Russians to sway election results.

""Even if this investigation continues unabated, there is a substantial risk that the American people will not have confidence in its results, no matter who is appointed to succeed him, given that the director of the FBI serves at the pleasure of the president,"" the group wrote.

The former prosecutors who signed the letter include Benito Romano, the district's interim U.S. Attorney during President George H.W. Bush's administration; Robert Cleary, who served as U.S. Attorney in New Jersey after working in the New York office; and Richard Ben-Veniste, who was a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal and later served as a member of the bipartisan commission that investigated the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Comey himself spent nearly two years as the U.S. Attorney in the New York-based district before his promotion to deputy attorney general during President George W. Bush's administration. President Obama appointed Comey to a 10-year term as FBI director in 2013.

Earlier this week, Democratic Attorneys General from 19 states and the District of Columbia also called on Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel.

The power to appoint an independent counsel falls to Rosenstein because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the Russian investigation. USA TODAY reported Friday that Rosenstein has indicated he's not yet inclined to appoint a special prosecutor. He is slated to brief senators on the Comey firing next week, according to a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

Trump has denied any collusion between his camp and Russian interests ahead of last November's election and has denounced the investigation as a ""witch hunt.""

Celebration time: Abigail Spencer, Malcolm Barrett and the rest of the 'Timeless' gang are coming back to NBC after all. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA T)

Apparently, fan voices do count.

In an unusual move, NBC reversed itself Saturday, renewing freshman drama Timeless for a second season. The network had canceled the time-travel adventure series earlier in the week.

The pickup is for 10 episodes, fewer than a traditional renewal order. In a celebratory tweet, co-creator Eric Kripke said Timeless would be back in the summer of 2018, but no return date has been set.

Fans made Timeless the top choice for renewal in USA TODAY's annual Save Our Shows poll, with 49% of participants in a record 146,000-vote turnout wanting to bring it back. It topped 23 other series considered ""on the bubble"" between renewal and cancellation in the poll.

Devotees made their voices heard elsewhere, too, starting an online #RenewTimeless campaign. As of Saturday, a new hashtag was born: #TimelessResuscitated.

In Timeless, Abigail Spencer, Matt Lanter and Malcolm Barrett play characters traveling to different eras in time. In the first season, their assignment was to stop a villain (Goran Visjnic) from changing history.

MORE: Check the renewal status of every show

Timeless, which average 8 million viewers per episode, had 16 episodes in its first season, fewer than the 22 that is the general broadcast standard. The last original episode ran in February.

Timeless producers, who also fiercely advocated for the show, celebrated the surprise reversal on Twitter.

Co-creator Shawn Ryan, not the only one to make a time-travel joke, said, ""NBC went back in time and changed history.""

9,USWNT starlet Mallory Pugh turns down offers from abroad to play in NWSL for the Washington Spirit | FOX Sports,"Mallory Pugh has signed with U.S. Soccer to play in the NWSL and she will suit up for the Washington Spirit. The deal is a coup for the league, which made signing the 19-year-old starlet a priority as soon as she announced she was foregoing college soccer to turn pro.

Pugh already has 22 caps for the United States and became the youngest American to ever score at an Olympics when she found the back of the net at the 2016 Games. She’s been a fixture with the U.S. ever since and there was talk she would skip college more than a year ago. However, she originally decided to enroll at UCLA, attending classes in the winter, but changed her mind last month and dropped out to play professionally.

No young American has more hype than Pugh, who drew interest not just from NWSL, but also teams abroad. Olympique Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain were reportedly interested in signing her, making the competition for her signature stiff. And while Pugh appeared most interested in staying in the U.S., multiple reports indicated that she didn’t want to play for the Washington Spirit, who had the top pick in the league’s distribution order.

The Spirit have had a rocky existence, with constant roster turnover and controversial ownership. It’s not exactly surprising that Pugh reportedly preferred to play elsewhere, especially when MLS-backed clubs like the Portland Thorns and Houston Dash could provide top-notch facilities and support.

However, U.S. Soccer, which pays the salaries of national teamers in NWSL, and the league were intent on keeping the brightest young American in the American league. U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati even got involved in the negotiations despite being in Bahrain for the FIFA Congress, according to the Washington Post.

With seemingly everyone involved in American women’s soccer working to ensure Pugh would play in NWSL, and with the Spirit, a deal got done. Pugh has a contract and will suit up for the Spirit.

Pugh’s contract with U.S. Soccer, which covers both her national team and Spirit commitments, is almost certainly relatively lucrative, but she will also cash in with endorsement money. She is already speaking with Nike and adidas over a footwear and apparel deal and will add other endorsements.

There are huge expectations for Pugh, which would be daunting for most 19-year-olds. But to this point, Pugh has handled everything thrown her way and shined on the field. Now she’ll try to do the same for the Washington Spirit.",fox-sports
9,Women's FA Cup final: Birmingham City 1-4 Manchester City,"Manchester City captain Steph Houghton lifts the Women's FA Cup in front of 35,271 fans at Wembley

World Player of the Year Carli Lloyd was among the scorers as Manchester City cruised past Birmingham to win the Women's FA Cup for the first time.

Lucy Bronze headed the opener from a free-kick and crossed for Izzy Christiansen to crash home the second.

Lloyd's header capped a fine 14-minute spell to make it 3-0 by the break.

Charlie Wellings' goal gave Birmingham brief hope, but Jill Scott's fierce shot sealed City's victory in front of a competition-record crowd at Wembley.

The 2016 Women's Super League champions are now in possession of all the main three domestic honours - the first team to do so since Arsenal Ladies in 2011.

Birmingham had knocked out holders Arsenal and 2015 winners Chelsea to make the final, but the 2012 winners never looked like repeating that feat on their first trip to Wembley in front of 35,271 fans.

City's high press pays dividends

City's relentlessly aggressive pressing game and dominant defence laid the foundation for a ruthless victory which was as good as sealed by the interval.

Birmingham's inability to retain possession under persistent pressure led to them conceding territory and numerous free-kicks and corners, where City's set-piece superiority twice told in a one-sided first half.

Moments after a near-post corner almost brought an opening goal for Megan Campbell with a neat flicked effort, Bronze darted in to convert Campbell's inviting in-swinging free-kick for a 1-0 lead.

Bronze then bustled Paige Williams out of possession and picked out Christiansen with a delightful cross.

(Photo: Khaled Desouki, AFP/Getty Images)

MINYA, Egypt — An Egyptian archaeological mission has found a necropolis holding at least 17 mummies near the Nile Valley city of Minya, in the first such find in the area, the antiquities ministry said Saturday.

The discovery was made in the village of Tuna al-Gabal, a vast archaeological site on the edge of the western desert. The area hosts a large necropolis for thousands of mummified ibis and baboon birds as well as other animals. It also includes tombs and a funerary building.

“It’s the first human necropolis to be found here in Tuna al-Gabal,” Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani told reporters at the site, 135 miles south of Cairo. The mummies were elaborately preserved therefore likely belong to officials and priests, he said.

The new discovery also includes six sarcophagi, two clay coffins, two papyri written in demotic script as well as a number of vessels, he said.

The necropolis, which is eight yards below ground level, dates back to the Late Period of Ancient Egypt and the Greco-Roman period, the minister noted.

Pointing to the edges of the necropolis where legs and feet of other mummies could be seen, the minister said that the find “will be much bigger,” as work is currently in only a preliminary stage.

The discovery comes as Egypt struggles to revive its tourism sector, partially driven by antiquities sightseeing, which was hit hard by political turmoil since the 2011 uprising.

9,Dana White explains why Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather has to be a boxing match | FOX Sports,"There’s a lot of chatter these days about some of the biggest stars from the UFC testing themselves against their counterparts in the sport of boxing.

Of course the biggest matchup that spurred on this conversation is the rumored bout between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather as the UFC lightweight champion looks to go after boxing’s retired pound-for-pound king.

From the start of the rumors about the proposed super fight, it was always meant to be a boxing match, which favors Mayweather, who is arguably one of the all time greats in that particular sport.

While McGregor may be a massive underdog to Maywaether in the ring, UFC president Dana White says the odds would be insurmountable in a mixed martial arts contest and that’s why he hasn’t heard any boxers calling out his fighters to meet inside the Octagon.

“You notice none of them are clamoring for that one. I like that one a lot better. Any of the big boxers that want to come over here and want to fight our guys, I’m in,” White teased when asked by no boxers have been offering to try out MMA. “Mayweather-McGregor would be over in 15 seconds.”

White has already played out that hypothetical scenario previously when he welcomed multi-time boxing champion James Toney to the Octagon where he faced Hall of Famer Randy Couture in 2010.

The fight lasted less than four minutes.

Obviously, White doesn’t expect any boxers to really want to test the waters in mixed martial arts, but he’s also putting down his foot on any of the fighters in the UFC stepping into the squared circle as well.

White will do everything in his power to put together the fight between McGregor and Mayweather, but that’s where his interest in becoming a boxing promoter comes to an end.

“The biggest one out there is Conor vs. Mayweather. That obviously makes a lot of sense,” White said. “Both guys are huge stars and they both want this fight.

16,When should spies tell companies that their systems can be hacked?,"A massive ransomware attack was carried out Friday, hitting hospitals, companies and government offices in nearly 100 countries.

It spread through a vulnerability leaked last month in a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA. The ransomware outbreak has reignited the debate about when spy agencies should disclose these vulnerabilities -- especially when people's lives are at stake.

The NSA and other spy agencies look for software vulnerabilities and then build tools to target and exploit them. Under current laws, they don't have to report the flaws to the company at risk. Instead, they can use them for intelligence gathering or law enforcement.

The leaked hacking tools publicized a Windows vulnerability. Even though Microsoft released a patch in March, computers and networks that hadn't updated their systems were still at risk. The ransomware, called WannaCry, locked down all the files on an infected computer and asked the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them.

Late Friday, Representative Ted Lieu announced he is working on legislation to reform the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, which is how the government decides when to disclose vulnerabilities. Lieu said it is ""deeply disturbing"" the NSA likely wrote the original malware used to ransom computers.

""[Friday's] worldwide ransomware attack shows what can happen when the NSA or CIA write malware instead of disclosing the vulnerability to the software manufacturer,"" Lieu said in a statement.

Microsoft issued a patch one month before it was leaked publicly, but it's unclear when or if the NSA told it about the vulnerability. Lieu says the current disclosure process is not transparent, and often misunderstood.

Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the ACLU, said the ransomware attack raises questions about agencies stockpiling vulnerabilities instead of responsibly disclosing them.

""It's particularly concerning when you're talking about widely-available software, when the impact on the people is going to be the public at large, not the handful of targets an agency might have,"" Singh Guliani told CNNTech.

Some privacy advocates say that if the NSA had disclosed the vulnerability when it was first discovered, the outbreak may have been prevented.

Related: World reels from cyberattack that hit nearly 100 countries

Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who exposed the broad scope of NSA surveillance in 2013, tweeted, ""If @NSAGov had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they *found* it, not when they lost it, this may not have happened.""

However, security researchers say firms that fail to keep their software up-to-date are also responsible for the ransomware outbreak. Organizations had two months to update their Microsoft products, which would have protected their systems.

""You can't force businesses to patch critical Windows vulnerabilities,"" said Adrian Sanabria, founder of security firm Savage Security. ""No matter how this was disclosed or when it was disclosed, some percentage of businesses would not have applied.""

UK hospitals were among the organizations affected by the ransomware outbreak. They were forced to reschedule patients, and people were warned to stay away from emergency rooms if possible.

In 2016, Motherboard reported hospitals across the UK run old, outdated Windows systems -- legacy technology that no longer receives updates. Those facilities are not unique. In the U.S., for instance, the federal government relies on legacy systems, spending $60 billion each year to maintain old technology, while spending just $20 billion on modernization.

Related: How to protect yourself from the massive ransomware attack

Organizations running older Windows software couldn't patch immediately because there was no patch available. However, in an unusual move, Microsoft released updates on Friday for some versions it no longer supports.

Consumers and businesses who have updated to the most recent Microsoft Windows software are protected from WannaCry.

Researchers say we will continue to see this type of ransomware. While this particular ransomware was inadvertently stopped on Friday, hackers could modify the code and try again.

Mark Mager, senior researcher at security firm Endgame, said it's the most prevalent and effective example of ransomware worming through networks around the world.

""Ransomware developers and attackers tend to borrow, copy and steal techniques and software from each other,"" he said. ""Since this WannaCry attack has been so effective thus far, it is quite likely that this is the first of many ransomware attacks that leverage exploits to effectively spread their payloads throughout the Internet.""",cnn

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE — Pope Francis says he won’t try to convince President Trump to soften his policies on immigration and the environment when they meet this month, but wants instead to find common ground and work for peace.

Francis said proselytizing isn’t his style — in politics or religion.

Speaking to reporters while traveling home Saturday from Portugal, Francis said he would say what he thinks sincerely to Trump and listen respectfully to what Trump has to say.

“I never make a judgment about a person without hearing him out,” the pope said.

Speculation has swirled about what Trump and Francis will discuss during their May 24 audience, given that Francis has already said anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is “not Christian.”

Trump, who made building a wall along the border with Mexico a signature campaign promise, responded by saying it was “disgraceful” that the pope would question his faith.

Francis said that in talks, he always tries to find “doors that are at least a little bit open” where common ground can be found, particularly in peace-building.

“Peace is artisanal. You do it every day,” he said.

Asked specifically if he would try to soften Trump’s policies, Francis said: “That is a political calculation that I don’t allow myself to make. Also in the religious sphere: I don’t proselytize.”

Trump will call on Francis mid-way through his first foreign trip, after visiting Saudi Arabia and Israel and before attending a NATO summit in Brussels and a G-7 summit in Italy.

"" He's co-host of the ""Politics & Polls"" podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

This week's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey has greatly intensified the fears that our commander in chief sees absolutely no boundaries to his power.

By axing the director of an agency investigating whether there was collusion between members of his campaign and Russians, Trump risked being seen as obstructing a criminal investigation. He then piled on by tweeting out a threat to Comey should he leak information to the media. If Trump obstructed justice, it would be fair to say this scandal could be worse than Watergate.

In retrospect, the most revealing moment in the 2016 campaign occurred when Trump said at a campaign rally in January, ""I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters."" The statement perfectly captures the mentality of the leader who holds the keys to power in the United States.

Besides his own sense of self, Trump's arrogance about what is possible comes from his counting on many aspects of our political system to protect him from political or legal punishment. There are some important differences between American politics in 2017 and 1974 that could insulate him from the fallout that President Richard Nixon faced.

Partisanship much stronger

Trump has always depended on the fact that partisanship is the most powerful force in the electorate. When he ran against Hillary Clinton, he anticipated that, in the end, Republicans would back him over any Democrat regardless of what he did or said. His dependence on partisanship remains a pillar of his political strategy. And there is reason for him to feel this way. It was notable that hours after the news of Comey's departure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he would not support the appointment of a special prosecutor.

The level of partisanship is much stronger than it was in final days of Nixon's presidency, when a group of Republicans, including Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and House Minority Leader John Rhodes, finally approached the President to say that the time had come to step down. They told him he had lost his support in Congress.

Today there are real questions about whether Republican leaders would ever do the same thing. If most party leaders in the House and Senate hold firm in defense of the President, Trump understands that -- at least until the 2018 midterm elections -- party discipline would curtail the scale and scope of any congressional investigation.

Friends in the media

The news media is also very different than it was in the early 1970s. President Trump counts on the existence of powerful conservative news outlets that have the capacity and the will to counteract damaging news stories about what he has done.

In recent days, Fox News has been working hard to blame the media , saying it is blowing this story out of proportion. Their web site is also running a headline that the new FBI Chief could reopen the case about Hillary Clinton's emails, throwing their readers some red meat as the President struggles.

While conservative news shows feed the electorate with alternative narratives about what is going wrong in Washington, social media now floods voters with fake news that confuses many people about what they should believe. With so much disinformation circulating in the political ecosystem, President Trump will count on his opponents having trouble building sustained support for an investigation, and possibly impeachment.

Trump knows he can find support in the conservative media to counteract the 2017 version of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the reporters whose work helped lead to Nixon's resignation.

Changing the subject

Trump no doubt depends on the idea that the short attention span of the country helps him survive this crisis. We move at a much faster pace today than in the early 1970s.

In this respect, the issue is not whether the public supports or opposes what he has done, but that Americans will quickly move on to the next story. President Trump will do everything in his power to make that happen with more outrageous statements and actions.

He can also accelerate discussions about high-profile policies such as tax cuts to redirect the energy of legislators who might otherwise focus on the Russia scandal. That tactic worked well in the campaign, during which voters could barely keep up with every new Trumpism. Effective investigations take time in our political system. The legislators who conduct them need to feel support from constituents over months, not days. It is not clear if the public can sustain this. If they don't, legislators will lose their sense of urgency about staying focused on this investigation.

During the campaign, Trump counted on the fact that many people hated politics enough that they would tolerate his outlandish ways. The President continues to rely on people concluding that today's news doesn't seem any worse than what they normally perceive to be going on in the ""swamp"" of Washington. Disillusionment with politics is so strong that public attitudes could insulate him.

But maybe, just maybe, this time President Trump went too far. The decision to fire James Comey and the string of lies that followed that decision feel different to many observers. President Trump seems to have really slipped into the realm of President Richard Nixon.

There is ample evidence to suggest that the President either lashed out at Comey because he was angry about the Russia investigation or, even worse, is attempting to cover this up and obstruct the investigation. When Trump threatened Comey in a tweet, it was impossible not to feel like this was 1974 all over again. With stories emerging that he had asked Comey several times whether he would be loyal, the determination of President Trump to contain this investigation becomes clearer by the hour.

The big question is not only what Trump did and when he did it, but whether the many parts of our political system that this president has counted on to save him will finally start to crumble. Most important is the question of whether there will be any profiles of courage -- Republican leaders who step in, just as they did in 1974, to say that this is enough and guarantee a full investigation as well as punitive actions should they be necessary. They should keep in mind that at this rate, when this story comes to an end, many historians might conclude that the comparison of the current situation to Watergate was unfair -- but to President Nixon rather than to Trump.

Americans can't assume that the system will work. It will take immense political pressure on legislators in the coming weeks to make certain that our leaders use every mechanism available to discover and prevent abuse of power and to ensure the health of our democracy for future generations.",cnn
9,"Bryce Harper, Nationals reach unusual contract deal","Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper is scheduled to become a free agent after the 2018 season. (Photo: Mitch Stringer, USA TODAY Sports)

In an unusual midseason agreement, the Washington Nationals and Bryce Harper came to terms on a one-year contract extension that gives both club and player cost certainty ahead of Harper’s expected free agency after the 2018 season.

The Nationals announced Saturday that they’d reached agreement on a 2018 contract for Harper, with FanRag Sports reporting that it was worth $21.65 million, a record for an arbitration-eligible player. It also includes a reported $1 million bonus should Harper win the 2018 MVP award.

MORE MLB COVERAGE:

While multiyear deals that take arbitration-eligible players to the doorstep of free agency are common – such as Lorenzo Cain’s two-year, $17.5 million deal with Kansas City that expires after this season – an in-season agreement for a player’s forthcoming sixth season are rare. But the Nationals offered Harper a salary number that likely would have exceeded what he would have received via arbitration after 2017.

While it may be just as it appears – a bit of early winter housekeeping – the agreement does indicate a degree of good faith on both sides’ parts. The Nationals could have let Harper play out the season and slot his 2018 salary accordingly.

With Harper off to a fine start – he’s batting .372 with an NL-best .496 on-base percentage, 10 home runs and a 1.213 OPS – the Nationals likely foresaw a significant raise coming, anyway.

And by settling this matter now, it at least shows both sides are talking as Harper approaches a 2018 winter in which he should shatter Alex Rodriguez’s record 10-year, $275 million pact for a free agent.

The Nationals will have significant competition to retain Harper’s services after 2018 – and may have already determined he’ll be too pricey, anyway. But at the least, they have ensured the air will be clear until then – and the club can make a run at a World Series this year and next with the 24-year-old superstar in the fold.",usa-today
6,The high stakes of the Comey controversy,"Those shocks will continue to reverberate next week and beyond because the issues involved are fundamental to American democracy, challenging the credibility of the White House and the vital legal institutions that sustain government.

As always in politics, timing is everything, and the timing here raises questions about the use and possible abuse of presidential power: Why did Trump do it? And more importantly, why now?

Orchestrating the chaos, as always, was Trump himself, who largely stayed out of public view last week but managed to incite pandemonium nonetheless.

In a dizzying sequence of events, sacked acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned in Senate testimony Monday that ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn was a ripe blackmail target for Russia while in office. The President suddenly fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, and then blindsided his own vice president with his shifting reasoning before sabotaging the White House press operation that was trying to defend him. Amid reports he demanded a loyalty pledge from Comey, critics warned Trump was guilty of a grotesque abuse of power, or even worse. But the President was not done. He suggested that Comey's investigation into links between his presidential campaign and Russia were indeed the reason he was fired.

In a Friday morning tweetstorm, he seemed to suggest he had a Nixon-style White House taping operation, and told Comey to stay mum. Next, he proposed ending press briefings because it's impossible for his communications team to keep up with the whiplash of his stream-of-consciousness presidency.

Trump's behavior provoked confusion and criticism in Washington. But the President is defiant and may have had his detractors in mind as he delivered a commencement address Saturday at Liberty University, in Virginia.

""No one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sideline saying why it can't be done,"" Trump said. ""Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic.""

View from afar

Meanwhile, out in the country, the political contagion is spreading.

In North Dakota, tempers boiled over at a town hall event hosted by Rep. Kevin Cramer. A man demanded to know whether the rich would benefit from the repeal of Obamacare and was escorted out by police after trying to shove a wad of cash into Cramer's collar.

Republican Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan was shouted down by constituents shouting ""health care for all.""

GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur, who helped pass the Obamacare repeal bill, walked into a metaphorical bear pit in his New Jersey district. ""Open your eyes!"" screamed one anti-Trump voter.

In West Virginia, a reporter was arrested after firing a string of questions at Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.

At times, in Washington and elsewhere, it seemed as thought the country's political equilibrium was at grave risk. It's now normal to observe that Trump is not like a conventional politician, that the point of his political project is to flout norms and shake up the cozy establishment and that the press takes him too literally.

And when Trump behaves in a way that has the media and Washington establishment types running around with their hair on fire, his loyal base of voters who sent him to the White House see a mission accomplished.

JUST WATCHED What do Trump's denials on 'tapes' and 'loyalty' really mean? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What do Trump's denials on 'tapes' and 'loyalty' really mean? 05:48

Loyalty

There's also no sign that congressional leaders are ready to desert him. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for instance, said Friday: ""I've decided I'm not going to comment on the tweets of the day or the hour.""

Trump went back to his seemingly impervious well of political support Friday, in a fundraising drive emailed to supporters in which he said : ""Let's show the hypocrites, liars, and 'elites' of Washington that the American people are dead serious about our mission to DRAIN THE SWAMP.""

But despite the loyalty of his base and for all the cacophony of the last three months, and the riotous campaign in 2016, the last week has seemed different. It felt at times that the White House was spinning off its political axis, that the President was isolated even from his own staff and that there was little rhyme or reason behind his increasingly erratic statements.

Trump's often frazzled but loyal press secretary Sean Spicer was even asked in his daily briefing on Friday whether Trump was ""out of control.""

""That's, frankly, offensive,"" Spicer said.

Yet, so extreme have been the events of the last few days that such a question -- which many would view as outrageous in more normal times -- didn't seem out of bounds.

Wild ride

While Trump has taken America on a wild ride since taking office, things did appear to get substantially more surreal and serious this week, with the possibility even looming that the President had edged closer to legal jeopardy with his stunning decision to can Comey while he was overseeing the Russia probe.

Spicer's stand-in, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, meanwhile, made a series of statements about Comey's popularity within the bureau and the scope of the FBI investigation that were comprehensively refuted by acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe in congressional testimony on Thursday.

Some Republicans are worried about the trajectory of Trump's presidency amid concern that a distracted White House could squander its opportunity to use a GOP majority to reshape the country's politics.

""This is ridiculous, it is not tenable and Republicans ... just politically, this cannot last, so go ahead and start holding the President accountable, the bogeyman is not going to come out from under your bed,"" Amanda Carpenter, a former communications aide to Sen. Ted Cruz said on ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Friday. ""Donald Trump's special police are not going to come get you in the middle of the night.""

""If you say, 'Mr. President, please respect the three branches of government. Please respect the American institution as it's supposed to work' ... you will be much better off,"" said Carpenter, a CNN commentator.

But beyond the politics, there's another element to the Trump presidency that makes it so discombobulating for many people.

Thanks to the President's mastery of social media, it's hard to escape him. He sometimes seems to be lurking on every device, from your iPhone to your laptop to your television, and thus barges into countless conversations or social occasion. If nothing else, by the end of his presidency, America may face the political equivalent post traumatic stress disorder. And the societal damage from Trump's perpetual war on institutions like the intelligence agencies, the courts and the media might take may years to assess.

In that sense, Friday's tweet storm blasting Comey and the ""fake media"" was just the capstone of a madcap week.

Timothy Naftali, a CNN historian and former director of the Nixon Library, suggested that the President would do well to reconsider his approach.

""I believe the President of the United States needs to think about his credibility,"" Naftali told CNN's Kate Bolduan, referring to Trump's response to the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling. Though there was no evidence he was guilty of anything, Trump is acting like he is, Naftali said.

""This is bigger than him, he is our head of state, he is our bald eagle, he represents our country. Perhaps there might be a time for a little bit of a moment and little reflection ... perhaps he might want to think about his conduct more seriously than he has up to now,"" he said.

Credibility

But it is not just Trump whose credibility seemed tarnished after his week. The reputation of his press shop has also taken a hit.

The suddenness of Comey's firing took the White House communications team by surprise, but they quickly built a rationale that the reason Comey was gone was a damning report on his handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe complied by the new deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.

It didn't seem remotely credible, but at least it was something. Within hours the tale was unraveling, but not before Vice President Mike Pence had put his own reputation on the line by peddling it to reporters on Capitol Hill.

Even though White House aides insisted repeatedly the firing had nothing to do with Russia, they were finally and disastrously undermined by their own boss.

""In fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,'"" Trump told NBC in an interview.

His comments made an already dicey job for Spicer's team all but impossible.

""I think the credibility is gone, and I'm really sorry to say that,"" said John Kirby, a former State Department and Pentagon spokesman who is now a CNN analyst.

""I don't think there is a crisis of credibility, I think it is shot, and I don't know how they ever get it back,"" Kirby said.

Some Republicans are meanwhile worried that the trust that has eroded in a fraught political time for the White House will leave the administration flailing when an inevitable international or national crisis flares.

""Having the President undermine the credibility of his staff makes their jobs harder not just today but moving forward,"" said Republican strategist Doug Heye on CNN.

""This White House has had a lot of crises but not a real true crisis yet. When that crisis hits, Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, they need credibility in front of those reporters who are going to be gunning after them and the President hurt them today. That is a real challenge for this White House.""",cnn
6,"Isolated and agitated, Trump rattles White House from within","Washington (CNN) A buoyant President Donald Trump reemerged into public for the first time in more than a week on Friday, offering few signs of the malaise that has gripped his administration since the hasty dismissal of FBI Director James Comey.

""It's such an honor to be here,"" Trump declared to a group of military mothers gathered in the East Room for a Mother's Day event. ""So bright and festive.""

Downstairs, the mood was anything but.

In conversations with multiple advisers, conducted on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, officials described to CNN a sense of dejection within the West Wing ranks, where most aides were caught off guard by Trump's decision and had little ability to develop a cogent response. Even Vice President Mike Pence, who found his public statements again undercut by Trump himself, was ""a little rattled"" at the events of the week, according to an administration adviser.

Through it all, Trump has remained largely out of sight, not leaving the White House once since he returned late Sunday night. He grew increasingly isolated and agitated, associates tell CNN, going a full week without hearing the applause and adulation that often brightens his mood.

Eager to move on

The President's public schedule has been devoid of opportunities for the press to see him since last Thursday. The absence came on a week when his decision to fire Comey consumed Washington; the President acted as an invisible central player to the drama, tweeting in spurts about alleged links between his campaign and Russia while largely remaining entrenched behind closed doors at the White House.

The quiet stretch was long-planned, officials said, with little expectation that Trump would deliver a bombshell. Instead, many in Trump's circle now view the past four days as the worst stretch of Trump's presidency so far. All are eager to move on.

""I think a lot of people are trying to figure out the new dynamic in town,"" one senior White House official said Friday, conceding the learning curve was often just as steep for those working steps from the Oval Office as across town.

Some of the more seasoned aides inside the West Wing refer to Trump as ""the hurry-up president,"" full of risk and reward. But this week, aides bluntly conceded, the risks were far more apparent. It was a fresh reminder the administration is not prepared to deal with a crisis of its own making, never mind a catastrophe outside its control.

Still, inside the West Wing the mood appeared to lift somewhat by the end of the week, as one exhausted aide declared, ""It's Friday.""

Trump, in both individual meetings and larger sessions, personally worked to bolster his staff's plummeting morale after rampant criticism of their inability to cast his firing of Comey in a positive light.

But the scars were still apparent, with one White House official asking: ""Do you think we're liars?""

And just as some aides began to feel on firmer footing after Comey's dismissal, Trump revived his longtime obsession with surveillance, suggesting that he was recording conversations inside the Oval Office. Neither Trump nor his spokesman tamped down on the implication, a telling development for a White House not shy about publicly rebutting what it claims is false reporting.

Another distraction

It was another distraction from a governing agenda that, only a week ago, appeared on track. Comey clean-up efforts largely crowded out attempts to move on to other items, leading to fears among White House staff that Trump's governing agenda may be derailed.

Aside from vague references to rebuilding the military during his Mother's Day remarks, Trump has otherwise made no mention of policy in public since Thursday of last week, when his administration hit its high mark after passage of a GOP health care bill in the House of Representatives.

When he did emerge for a pair of interviews, Trump only seemed to deepen questions about the episode. He told NBC News on Thursday that he was thinking about the Russia probe when he made the call to dismiss the man overseeing it. He added he had long ago decided Comey must go.

Both seemed to directly contradict the ways Trump's aides -- including Pence -- had been working to salvage the Comey storyline.

After Trump told NBC that he'd long planned to fire Comey -- and was not, as Pence declared seven times on Capitol Hill Wednesday, acting on the advice of his Justice Department -- the Vice President found himself again in a position of being contradicted by his boss.

""He's not rattled very often and he was a little rattled"" about how the events transpired, a senior administration adviser said.

According to this adviser, Trump made the decision to fire Comey -- and Pence knew the decision was coming before the announcement on Tuesday -- but he wasn't fully briefed on the President's reasoning for firing Comey before he went in front of cameras on Wednesday.

""He went out there without all the information,"" the adviser said. ""It was not an attempt to lie.""

Other advisers found themselves in similar positions. Briefing reporters at the same time Trump spoke in the East Room Friday, press secretary Sean Spicer struggled to explain multiple shifts in the timeline surrounding Comey's firing or the motivations behind it. Perhaps more worrisome, he wasn't able to say whether conversations in Trump's White House were being recorded -- a possibility Trump raised himself on Twitter Friday morning.

""The President has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer said.

Indeed, Trump himself told a Fox interviewer that he wouldn't talk about whether he'd recorded conversations with his canned FBI director.

In the public eye

Trump resumes a more robust public schedule starting Saturday. He'll deliver a commencement address at Liberty University, the evangelical institution in Lynchburg, Virginia. Next week he welcomes the leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Colombia for talks and delivers another graduation speech at the US Coast Guard academy in New London, Connecticut.

And he departs on a five-stop foreign swing on Friday, though the grueling pace of presidential foreign travel isn't likely to provide much relief for a beleaguered president.

For some aides, a departure from Washington can't come quickly around. Those around Trump are eager to get him out of the White House and outside of Washington as soon as possible, according to a source close to the White House. Trump generally basks in crowd settings, though he has traveled far less than his predecessors.

""We need to get the President outside the beltway,"" this source said.

'Meltdown mode'

Republican allies on Capitol Hill also hope the President can soon resume his push for key items of his legislative agenda, including a massive tax reform package that the White House promised in broad terms last month, but has since gotten little attention.

Trump's legislative affairs operation has largely gone quiet since the health care victory last week. On Tuesday, as senators hunkered down on Capitol Hill to hammer out their own version of the health bill, Trump was executing his plan to fire Comey; the news dominated conversations among lawmakers for the rest of the week.

When House Speaker Paul Ryan visited Ohio on Wednesday, he wanted to talk about tax reform. But headlines from his event largely focused on his refusal to comment about Comey's firing.

One Republican congressional source described the White House in ""meltdown mode"" as it scrambled to contain the Comey fallout.

Ryan himself worked to avoid the topic during an appearance in Wisconsin Friday.

""I'm going leave it to the President to talk about and defend his tweets,"" he said when asked about Trump's suggestion he may be recording his Oval Office meetings.

But Ryan seemed to acknowledge that, at least for the next four years, there will be little certainty coming from the White House.

There is ample evidence to suggest that the President either lashed out at Comey because he was angry about the Russia investigation or, even worse, is attempting to cover this up and obstruct the investigation. When Trump threatened Comey in a tweet, it was impossible not to feel like this was 1974 all over again. With stories emerging that he had asked Comey several times whether he would be loyal, the determination of President Trump to contain this investigation becomes clearer by the hour.

The big question is not only what Trump did and when he did it, but whether the many parts of our political system that this president has counted on to save him will finally start to crumble. Most important is the question of whether there will be any profiles of courage -- Republican leaders who step in, just as they did in 1974, to say that this is enough and guarantee a full investigation as well as punitive actions should they be necessary. They should keep in mind that at this rate, when this story comes to an end, many historians might conclude that the comparison of the current situation to Watergate was unfair -- but to President Nixon rather than to Trump.

Americans can't assume that the system will work. It will take immense political pressure on legislators in the coming weeks to make certain that our leaders use every mechanism available to discover and prevent abuse of power and to ensure the health of our democracy for future generations.",cnn
6,"Clapper on collusion between Russia, Trump aides: There could be evidence","Story highlights He says the Russia investigation is a ""dark cloud"" hanging over the White House

He also said the FBI didn't lose faith in Comey

Washington (CNN) Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC'S Andrea Mitchell on Friday that there could be evidence of collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign -- a statement that comes on the heels of an apparent public threat Trump made this morning to fired FBI Director James Comey, tweeting that Comey had better hope their conversations have not been taped.

""There was no evidence that rose to that level, at that time, that found its way in to the intelligence community assessment, which we had pretty high confidence in,"" the former director of national intelligence said of collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russians, referring also to the US intelligence assessment that Russia tried to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump. ""That's not to say there wasn't evidence, but not that met that threshold.""

When asked whether the FBI's Russia investigation is fake news, or a ""witch hunt,"" as Trump called it this morning in another tweet, Clapper told MSNBC on Friday: ""I don't believe it is.""

""But that's kind of irrelevant,"" he continued. ""I think what needs to happen here is to clear this cloud, a cloud that's hanging over the administration, over the President, over the White House. It would be in everyone's best interest to get to the bottom of this, and for the country. Otherwise this is going to continue to linger as a dark cloud, in my opinion, over this administration.""

Clapper's remarks come after Trump tweeted that Clapper had said there is no collusion between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia.

16,Ransomware: World reels from massive cyberattack,"Organizations around the world were digging out this weekend from what experts are calling one of the biggest cyberattacks ever.

Hospitals, major companies and government offices were hit by a virus that seeks to seize control of computers until the victims pay a ransom.

Experts said that even as the spread of the attacks apparently has been stymied, its full ramifications are not yet known because the virus may be lurking still on computers around the world.

Cybersecurity firm Avast said it had identified more than 75,000 ransomware attacks in 99 countries on Friday, making it one of the broadest and most damaging cyberattacks in history.

Avast said the majority of the attacks targeted Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan. But U.K. hospitals, Chinese universities and global firms like Fedex (FDX) also reported they had come under assault.

Security experts said the spread of the ransomware had been inadvertently stopped late Friday. The ransomware was designed to repeatedly contact an unregistered domain in its code. A 22-year-old security researcher in the U.K, who goes by MalwareTech, registered that domain to analyze the attack, but it turned out the ransomware needed it to remain unregistered to keep spreading.

""Thus by registering it we inadvertently stopped any subsequent infections,"" he told CNNTech.

However, a hacker could change the code to remove the domain and try the ransomware attack again.

Related: When should spies tell companies that their systems can be hacked?

It remained unclear how many organizations had already lost control of their data to the malicious software -- and researchers warned that copycat attacks could follow.

Europol said Saturday that the attack was of an ""unprecedented level and requires international investigation."" And the U.K. government called an emergency meeting over the crisis.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, at a meeting of world leaders in Italy, said the attack was a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity. ""It's a big priority of mine that we protect the financial infrastructure,"" he said.

The ransomware, called WannaCry, locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them. The exploit was leaked last month as part of a trove of NSA spy tools.

Related: How to protect yourself from the ransomware attack

The ransomware is spread by taking advantage of a Windows vulnerability that Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) released a security patch for in March. But computers and networks that hadn't updated their systems were still at risk.

In the wake of the attack, Microsoft said it had taken the ""highly unusual step"" of releasing a patch for computers running older operating systems including Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003.

But the patches won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

""Affected machines have six hours to pay up and every few hours the ransom goes up,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, the principal security researcher at security firm Kaspersky Lab. ""Most folks that have paid up appear to have paid the initial $300 in the first few hours.""

On Saturday, experts said it appeared that the ransomware had made just over $20,000, although they expected that number to pop when people went back into the office Monday.

Related: 5 things to know about the attack

WannaCry has already caused massive disruption around the globe.

Sixteen National Health Service organizations in the UK were hit, and some of those hospitals canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible. The NHS said in a statement on Saturday that there was no evidence that patient information had been compromised.

In China, the internet security company Qihoo360 issued a ""red alert"" saying that a large number of colleges and students in the country had been affected by the ransomware, which is also referred to as WannaCrypt. State media reported that digital payment systems at PetroChina gas stations were offline, forcing customers to pay cash.

""Global internet security has reached a moment of emergency,"" Qihoo360 warned.

Major global companies said they also came under attack.

Fedex said Friday it was ""experiencing interference with some of our Windows-based systems caused by malware"" and was trying to fix the problems as quickly as possible. Two big telecom companies, Telefónica (TEF) of Spain and Megafon of Russia, were also hit.

""This is turning into the biggest cybersecurity incident I've ever seen,"" U.K.-based security architect Kevin Beaumont said.

Russia's Interior Ministry released a statement Friday acknowledging a ransomware attack on its computers, adding that less than 1% of computers were affected, and that the virus was now ""localized"" and being destroyed.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in a statement late Friday, encouraged people to update their operating systems. ""We are actively sharing information related to this event and stand ready to lend technical support and assistance as needed to our partners, both in the United States and internationally,"" the department said.

Related: How leaked NSA spy tools created a hacking free-for-all

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, the attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion.

When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.

16,How to protect yourself from the massive ransomware attack,"It's on track to be one of the biggest recorded ransomware attacks ever, with tens of thousands of infected computers in nearly 100 countries.

Friday's attack largely hit businesses and large organizations: UK hospitals, a Spanish telecom, FedEx, the Russian Interior Ministry. But how much do individuals need to worry about their personal computers being targeted?

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that takes over a computer and locks the user out, preventing them from accessing any files until they pay money. This particular program, called WannaCry, asks for about $300, though the price increases over time.

WannaCry takes advantage of a Windows flaw discovered by the NSA and made public by hackers in April. Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) did release a patch for the vulnerability in March. But computers and networks that didn't update their systems were still at risk.

On Friday, a security researcher inadvertently created a ""kill switch"" to help stop the spread of this ransomware. However, a hacker could rewrite the code to omit the kill switch and start trying to infect new machines with a new version of it.

The worm is primarily impacting business, where it can spread quickly through a network to take down an entire company. Business take longer to install critical updates and patches, often to avoid impacting any legacy software they are running.

But individuals with PCs running Windows should still take a few precautions. First, install any software updates immediately and make it a regular habit. Turn on auto-updaters where available (Microsoft offers that option). Microsoft also recommends running its free anti-virus software for Windows.

If you don't already have a backup routine, start now and regularly save copies of all your files. That way if your machine gets infected and your photos and documents are encrypted, you don't need to worry about losing them.

Finally, always stay alert. Don't click on links that you don't recognize, or download files from people you don't know personally.

It's not just your computer that you need to be worried about. This attack has impacted many large services and organizations, including hospitals in England, a telecom and natural gas company in Spain, and FedEx. Basic services that impact your life could be impacted even while your own machines is clean.

16,When should spies tell companies that their systems can be hacked?,"A massive ransomware attack was carried out Friday, hitting hospitals, companies and government offices in nearly 100 countries.

It spread through a vulnerability leaked last month in a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA. The ransomware outbreak has reignited the debate about when spy agencies should disclose these vulnerabilities -- especially when people's lives are at stake.

The NSA and other spy agencies look for software vulnerabilities and then build tools to target and exploit them. Under current laws, they don't have to report the flaws to the company at risk. Instead, they can use them for intelligence gathering or law enforcement.

The leaked hacking tools publicized a Windows vulnerability. Even though Microsoft released a patch in March, computers and networks that hadn't updated their systems were still at risk. The ransomware, called WannaCry, locked down all the files on an infected computer and asked the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them.

Late Friday, Representative Ted Lieu announced he is working on legislation to reform the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, which is how the government decides when to disclose vulnerabilities. Lieu said it is ""deeply disturbing"" the NSA likely wrote the original malware used to ransom computers.

""[Friday's] worldwide ransomware attack shows what can happen when the NSA or CIA write malware instead of disclosing the vulnerability to the software manufacturer,"" Lieu said in a statement.

Microsoft issued a patch one month before it was leaked publicly, but it's unclear when or if the NSA told it about the vulnerability. Lieu says the current disclosure process is not transparent, and often misunderstood.

Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the ACLU, said the ransomware attack raises questions about agencies stockpiling vulnerabilities instead of responsibly disclosing them.

""It's particularly concerning when you're talking about widely-available software, when the impact on the people is going to be the public at large, not the handful of targets an agency might have,"" Singh Guliani told CNNTech.

Some privacy advocates say that if the NSA had disclosed the vulnerability when it was first discovered, the outbreak may have been prevented.

Related: World reels from cyberattack that hit nearly 100 countries

Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who exposed the broad scope of NSA surveillance in 2013, tweeted, ""If @NSAGov had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they *found* it, not when they lost it, this may not have happened.""

However, security researchers say firms that fail to keep their software up-to-date are also responsible for the ransomware outbreak. Organizations had two months to update their Microsoft products, which would have protected their systems.

""You can't force businesses to patch critical Windows vulnerabilities,"" said Adrian Sanabria, founder of security firm Savage Security. ""No matter how this was disclosed or when it was disclosed, some percentage of businesses would not have applied.""

UK hospitals were among the organizations affected by the ransomware outbreak. They were forced to reschedule patients, and people were warned to stay away from emergency rooms if possible.

In 2016, Motherboard reported hospitals across the UK run old, outdated Windows systems -- legacy technology that no longer receives updates. Those facilities are not unique. In the U.S., for instance, the federal government relies on legacy systems, spending $60 billion each year to maintain old technology, while spending just $20 billion on modernization.

Related: How to protect yourself from the massive ransomware attack

Organizations running older Windows software couldn't patch immediately because there was no patch available. However, in an unusual move, Microsoft released updates on Friday for some versions it no longer supports.

Consumers and businesses who have updated to the most recent Microsoft Windows software are protected from WannaCry.

Researchers say we will continue to see this type of ransomware. While this particular ransomware was inadvertently stopped on Friday, hackers could modify the code and try again.

Mark Mager, senior researcher at security firm Endgame, said it's the most prevalent and effective example of ransomware worming through networks around the world.

""Ransomware developers and attackers tend to borrow, copy and steal techniques and software from each other,"" he said. ""Since this WannaCry attack has been so effective thus far, it is quite likely that this is the first of many ransomware attacks that leverage exploits to effectively spread their payloads throughout the Internet.""",cnn

Washington (CNN) In his first commencement speech as president, Donald Trump encouraged graduating seniors at Liberty University to draw lessons from his example as a political outsider, telling them to embrace being criticized at the end of a week during which he very much was.

Speaking before what the Christian university estimated were 50,000 graduates, Trump cast criticisms of his actions as a sign that he was doing honorable work in remarks that touched upon religion but were not particularly imbued with religious overtones.

""You aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you're right,"" the President told the crowd, to intermittent applause. ""We don't need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives.""

Trump appeared in good spirits at the end of a tumultuous week in which he fired FBI Director James Comey, leaving his close aides and surrogates to try to deal with the political fallout. In lengthy remarks, he ribbed the school's president, Jerry Falwell Jr., and at one point offered game-by-game commentary on Liberty's upcoming football season, their first in a more competitive college conference, the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Football Bowl Subdivision of independent schools.

10,Global cyber-attack: Security blogger halts ransomware 'by accident',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero'

A UK security researcher has told the BBC how he ""accidentally"" halted the spread of the malicious ransomware that has affected hundreds of organisations, including the UK's NHS.

The 22-year-old man, known by the pseudonym MalwareTech, had taken a week off work, but decided to investigate the ransomware after hearing about the global cyber-attack.

He managed to bring the spread to a halt when he found what appeared to be a ""kill switch"" in the rogue software's code.

""It was actually partly accidental,"" he told the BBC, after spending the night investigating. ""I have not slept a wink.""

Although his discovery did not repair the damage done by the ransomware, it did stop it spreading to new computers, and he has been hailed an ""accidental hero"".

""I would say that's correct,"" he told the BBC.

Cyber-attack scale 'unprecedented'

NHS 'robust' after cyber-attack

""The attention has been slightly overwhelming. The boss gave me another week off to make up for this train-wreck of a vacation.""

What exactly did he discover?

The researcher first noticed that the malware was trying to contact a specific web address every time it infected a new computer.

But the web address it was trying to contact - a long jumble of letters - had not been registered.

MalwareTech decided to register it, and bought it for $10.69 (£8). Owning it would let him see where computers were accessing it from, and give him an idea of how widespread the ransomware was.

Image copyright MalwareTech Image caption Owning the web address let MalwareTech monitor where infections were happening

By doing so, he unexpectedly triggered part of the ransomware's code that told it to stop spreading.

Analysis: How did it start?

What is the ransomware?

This type of code is known as a ""kill switch"", which some attackers use to halt the spread of their software if things get out of hand.

He tested his discovery and was delighted when he managed to trigger the ransomware on demand.

""Now you probably can't picture a grown man jumping around with the excitement of having just been 'ransomwared', but this was me,"" he said in a blog post.

MalwareTech now thinks the code was originally designed to thwart researchers trying to investigate the ransomware, but it backfired by letting them remotely disable it.

Does this mean the ransomware is defeated?

While the registration of the web address appears to have stopped one strain of the ransomware spreading from device-to-device, it does not repair computers that are already infected.

Security experts have also warned that new variants of the malware that ignore the ""kill switch"" will appear.

""This variant shouldn't be spreading any further, however there'll almost certainly be copycats,"" said security researcher Troy Hunt in a blog post.

MalwareTech warned: ""We have stopped this one, but there will be another one coming and it will not be stoppable by us.

""There's a lot of money in this, there is no reason for them to stop. It's not much effort for them to change the code and start over.""",bbc-news

3,Pope Francis canonises two children at Portugal's Fatima shrine,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pope Francis makes saints of Portuguese shepherd children

Pope Francis was greeted by crowds of hundreds of thousands as he made saints of two shepherd children at the Fatima shrine complex in Portugal.

""We declare the blissful Francisco Marto and Jacinta Marto saints,"" the pontiff said to loud applause.

It is 100 years since the two - and a third child - reported seeing the Virgin Mary while tending sheep. The third is also on the way to sainthood.

Portugal boosted security and re-imposed border controls temporarily.

Some 500,000 worshippers gathered in the town of Fatima, north of Lisbon, for the ceremony on Saturday, the Vatican said in a statement.

Roman Catholic pilgrims converged on the Fatima Sanctuary from countries as far away as China, Venezuela and East Timor.

The town's local bishop first read out the request for the two ""little shepherds"" to be canonised before the Pope declared them both saints of the Catholic Church.

Earlier on Saturday, the official Twitter account of the Pope posted a message with reference to the Virgin Mary.

""Whenever we look to Mary, we come to believe once again in the revolutionary nature of love and tenderness,"" it said.

The pontiff also met Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa for a private meeting ahead of the ceremony.

Plea for harmony

On Friday, Pope Francis flew into Fatima in a helicopter and travelled through the town in his ""Popemobile"".

At a candle-lit vigil he called for harmony between all people at the Chapel of the Apparitions and spoke of wars ""tearing our world apart"".

The chapel is built on the very spot where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Devotees took part in the candle-lit procession

Two of the children - Jacinta and Francisco Marto - have been canonised for the miracles attributed to them. They died in the 1918-1919 European influenza pandemic.

The so-called three secrets of Fatima were written down by their cousin, Lucia dos Santos, who died in 2005 aged 97. The beatification process for her began in 2008.

The Church attaches great value to their visions, as Mary is believed to have revealed truths to help mankind. The Church says the first vision came on 13 May 1917.

In a video message to the people of Portugal, the Pope said he was going to present himself to Mary ""and I need to feel you close, physically and spiritually, so that we are one heart and one mind"".

Image copyright AFP Image caption The three shepherd children who had visions of the Virgin Mary in Fatima (L-R: Lucia, Francisco, Jacinta)

What are the three secrets?

They are prophecies written down by Lucia, years after the apparitions that the three said they had witnessed. She spent her adult life as a nun at a convent in Coimbra.

The first two secrets in Lucia's account were revealed in 1942.

The first described a terrifying vision of hell, with a ""great sea of fire"", demons and human souls

The second is interpreted as Mary's prediction that World War One would end and that World War Two would start during the papacy of Pius XI

Mary also called for the ""consecration"" of Russia, saying: ""If my requests are heeded, Russia will be converted, and there will be peace; if not, she will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church""

Lucia sealed the third secret in an envelope, which was handed to the Vatican in 1957 and only revealed in 2000

It described an angel demanding ""penance!"", then the Pope and other clergy climbing a mountain, only to be killed by soldiers firing bullets and arrows.

What does the Vatican say about them?

According to Pope Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, the visions described in the three secrets are ""meant to mobilise the forces of change in the right direction"".

They are not like the Bible - a text he describes as a ""public revelation"".

The Fatima visions are ""private revelations"", he writes. Their purpose is ""to help live more fully"" in accordance with Christ's teaching.

The late Pope John Paul II was shot by a Turkish gunman on 13 May 1981.

He believed that his survival was due to Mary's divine intervention, and that the third secret had predicted the attack on him.

John Paul donated the bullet to Fatima, and it was inserted into the crown adorning a statue of Mary there.

He follows John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who also made pilgrimages to the Fatima Sanctuary.

Security was high at the site, with Portugal deploying 6,000 police and emergency workers. Concrete blocks were placed on approach roads, to stop any terrorist ""ramming"" attack with a vehicle.

Only nine border crossings remained open, with systematic checks, as Portugal temporarily suspended the Schengen open borders pact.

10,Microsoft unveils the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update,"Microsoft has announced that its next big update to Windows 10 will be the Fall Creators Update and it’s coming later this year.

You might be thinking, ‘wait a minute, didn’t the Creators Update just roll out?’ And you’d be right, but Microsoft says their not done making its operating system even better for creative types.

Windows Story Remix

At the center of this upcoming Windows 10 build is a new creative app called Windows Story Remix. Its most interesting aspect is that it allows users to create mixed reality content. Microsoft demoed the app by adding 3D objects to photos and video to help tell stories users can explore.

Otherwise, the new app is essentially about helping users create shareable memories out of their photos and videos by automatically stitching them together. From there, users can add little creative touches like a soundtrack, theme, cinematic transitions (read: star wipes), or even draw and write on them with Windows Ink.

The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will hit many of the best 2-in-1 laptops

Windows Story Remix is also a collaborative app, that allows users to share media. For example multiple parents could all shoot different angles of a soccer game and the app will automatically pull together the footage to create a highlight reel.

With face recognition, users could also tell Windows Story remix to make a certain person the start of the video.

While this app is currently untitled, it seems like it will be an interesting new wrinkle to the Windows 10 experience and feels like a perfect fit for Windows 10 Mobile and its lineup of smartphones – which we have no doubt it will land on eventually.

Image 1 of 3 Windows 10 is getting a big makeover Image 2 of 3 Hello white taskbar Image 3 of 3 Apps get a new look too

Fluent Design System

At the heart of the Fall Creators Update is a new user interface called the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which both changes the look and how you interact with apps. Originally code named Project Neon , Fluent Design will drive more expressive and engaging apps for a wide range of devices.

Secondly, the new design language hopes to tackle input diversity head on. With a modern Windows 10 device, users can interact with touch, ink, voice, gaze and gesture. Simply put, Fluent Design hopes to create a more harmonious and responsive cross-device experience.

Pick up and go

Speaking of cross-device experiences, the Fall Creators Update comes with new features specifically designed for those who flip from one device to the next.

Microsoft introduced Timeline to help users jump back into what they were working on. It works by showing users a visual timeline of their desktop so they can get right back into the files, apps and sites they were accessing at the time. At a basic level, it’s a lot like MacOS’ Time Machine, but for revisiting your desktop state from an earlier time and place.

Beyond your PC, Cortana enables the same Pick Up Where You Left Off across a wider variety of Windows, iOS and Android devices. Microsoft gave the example of being able to work on a doc on the PC and Cortana asking a user whether they would like to finish it up on a phone.

Last but not least, Clipboard brings universal copy and paste to Windows devices and beyond. Aside from just clipping text and web links, Clipboard also allows users to transfer photos and animated GIFs from a Windows PC to their preferred mobile device.",techradar

There are places in which you can find a cheap Apple Watch Nike Plus, and places like Amazon that have third-party retailers jacking up the price on this sought-after Nike Apple Watch. Be careful out there.

The best Apple Watch for most people

Faster performance than Apple Watch 1

Lacks Series 2's bright screen

No GPS and not waterproof





The Apple Watch Series 1 is actually the best Apple Watch for most people who aren’t all-star runners and avid swimmers. It has most of the specs you need on a smartwatch. This is a refreshed Apple Watch compared to the original Apple Watch, so it has a faster dual-core processor and better battery life as a result. It runs all the same watchOS 3 software. Best of all, the much cheaper Apple Watch Series 1 price doesn’t leave out a whole lot. If you don’t need to track GPS runs and swim with it on, you’ll save money. The discounted Apple Watch Series 1 still comes in two sizes, 38mm and 42mm, but only has the more economical an aluminum case and Sport band. It’s the best Apple Watch value.

Original Apple Watch deals

The iPhone-tailored smartwatch merely a convenient gadget

Cheapest Apple Watch now

Include heart-rate monitor

Noticeably slower performance

Battery life is one (waking) day

The cheapest Apple Watch on sale today is the original iWatch, the company’s first smartwatch that came out in April 2015. No, the Apple Store doesn’t sell this price-reduced Apple Watch 1 anymore, but there are plenty of retailers still hawking the original Apple Watch at a discount. The best part – besides the cheap Apple Watch 1 price – is the fact that it runs watchOS 3 with all the same apps as an Apple Watch 2. It’s a vast improvement over the launch software.

Apple Watch band/strap deals

Bands are not one-size-fits-all-budgets

Wide variety of sizes, colors and prices

Incredibly easy to slide onto your Watch

Can't use normal watch straps

Official Apple Watch bands are pricey

Your Apple Watch literally isn’t complete without the best deals on Apple Watch bands. They make the geeky smartwatch stylish enough to show off to late adopters.

In fact, you’re going to want multiple cheap Apple Watch straps simply because more elegant bands are far from ideal for the gym. Vice versa, Sport Bands don’t cut it at the fancy dinner table.

Everyday in the news, we see new cheap Apple Watch bands trying to become the de facto alternative to the more expensive, official Apple Watch bands, and they’re usually just as good. Trust us, buying a trio of third-party, lookalike Apple Watch bands for the price of one official strap is a relief after paying so much for the smartwatch itself. Plus, you'll want to save up for the eventually Apple Watch 3.",techradar
10,Google's Project Treble will actually let you experience the latest Android updates,"Google’s new Project Treble is set to speed up the time it takes for your phone to get access to Android O, the upcoming release that’s now confirmed for Summer.



Traditionally, if you buy a phone that’s not made by Google, you run the risk of waiting weeks, months, or even years for it to be updated to the latest and greatest operating system available.



This changes that, or so Google says, with Treble being its “biggest change yet to low-level system architecture.” In a nutshell, Google’s work here is to make it easier for manufacturers to push the new software that you so desire to your phone, cutting down on the time and money requirements that were previously necessary.



Posted in the Android developers blog , the big difference that will help speed things along for your preferred device maker is that Google is pushing for phones released moving forward to feature vendor implementation, part of the greater Android architecture, that won’t need to be updated with each new OS release.



According to the post, it’s the interface that gives developers access to “hardware-specific features of Android.” With these changes in place, manufacturers will have far fewer things to rework with the next major update.

A big step forward?",techradar
10,"Google IO 2017: dates, schedule and rumors for Google's big developer conference","Update: Just days before IO, Google announced Project Treble to speed up the time it takes for phones to receive Android O. The new version of Android, by the way, is also confirmed to release this summer.

Project Treble aims to cut down on the fragmentation that can plague Android releases, when users wait months or even years to get the latest flavor of Android on their devices. It will be easier for manufacturers to push out new software, starting with Android O.

Original article below...

Google IO, the search giant's annual developer conference, is almost here. Actually, let's try that again: Google is calling this year's IO an ""outdoor developer festival"", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and so much more.

The Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif.

The official Google IO 2017 schedule is also out now, letting attendees and those watching from home get a taste of what Google has cooking.

We're still digesting everything Google announced at IO 2016, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat , the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.

This year's event looks to be just as jam-packed, so if you're a developer interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop on over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited in order to register). Attending IO is no cheap trip: General admission Google IO 2017 tickets cost $1,150 (about £930, AU$1,535).

While this ""festival"" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.

Google IO 2017 schedule

Google has announced a ton of talks as part of the Google IO 2017 schedule , and here's some great news if you're unable to attend in person: Every technical session, all 150+ of them, will be livestreamed.

Google is also doing something different this year and hosting an hour-long Developer Keynote at 1pm PT on May 17, shortly after the main keynote wraps up. This will give developers a chance to gain deeper insight into how they can utilize everything Google just announced.

A few sessions to highlight from the current schedule are:

What's New in Android : 2pm - 3pm PT May 17. In what will likely be the most well-attended and widely watched session of IO, What's New in Android will dive into topics such as the Android O Developer Preview SDK, Support Libraries and what Google says will be ""other new and exciting developments."" Expect plenty of details on what Android O will offer both developers and users.

Android Wear: What's New & Best Practices : 9:30am - 10:30am PT on May 18. This session will ""introduce new features of the next release of Android Wear,"" which could be a sign Google will talk about Android Wear 3.0 at the conference.

What's new for Android TV : 10:30am - 11:30am PT on May 18. Here, developers will learn all the latest on the Android TV front, including new APIs, features and future platform improvements.

Introduction to Android Instant Apps : 1:30pm - 2:30pm PT on May 18. In what will likely be a key theme of the show, this session will go over Instant Apps for developers, including how to build them. While this may be a bit too technical for regular users, it's a sign Google will devote plenty of time - and probably officially roll out - Instant Apps at the show. Here's more on why this is a good thing for users .

Google promises more talks are on the way, so we'll keep this page updated with anything that sounds interesting between now and May 17. To get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!

Say hello to Android O

The star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O next week.

While we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another public submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.

What will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case with Android O.

But what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.

One of the most exciting features in the early build is 'Background limits'. This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.

Android O also currently houses picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.

Google also announced Project Treble in the days before IO, which will help users get the latest flavor of Android more quickly. In a nutshell, Google's work here is to make it easier for manufacturers to push new software that you want desire to your phone, cutting down on the time and money requirements that were previously necessary.

One final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth to your devices.

As Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, also look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.

What's the word on Android Wear 2?

Android Wear 2 launched in February, so while it's unlikely Google will announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.

For starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.

We wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2 apps are announced, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.

With Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.

ZTE Quartz review: The latest Android Wear 2 smartwatch

Google Home invasion

Google introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write ""Google"" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features made available to the original.

One of the more robust rumors is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.

Considering Google already has the Project Fi and Google Voice services, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which puts the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.

Another report, this time from early April , says Google is considering an updated Home smart speaker that doubles as a mesh Wi-Fi router.

The device would act as a personal assistant and internet router in one, and presumably like Google Wifi would need multiple units to create a mesh network.

A few points against updated hardware or major new features are that Google Home added one of its most requested features, multiple user support , in mid-April and the device just went on sale in the UK. Still, if Google is working to improve Google Home, chances are we'll see whatever is in store at IO.

Google Chrome improvement

Another area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and this could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.

The most likely developments we'll hear about are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.

There are also whispers spreading Google is preparing an ad-blocker built into Chrome. It's almost impossible ad revenue-dependent Google would block every ad on Chrome, so it's more likely Google will introduce a tool that filters out the most offending ads. Perhaps we'll meet this quasi-ad blocker at IO.

New Google Pixel phones? Perhaps

Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL are in the works.

It's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.

Not only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, and if a recent Google investment in LG Display is anything to go by, the new Pixel phones will have curved OLED screens.

Virtual reality, Chromecast and everything else

There's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we might see:

Like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2 headset, but we'll undoubtedly have news on the VR front from the Big G. These could include a headset price reduction, or updates related to how developers create and publish content for virtual reality.

With Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , as Google recently told us, we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.

On the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 . This would certainly make sense, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the IO cards.

Another possible topic are updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.

We could also be in for a new Chromecast as it's been some months since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale. At one time the best selling streaming video device, Google may look to recapture some of that old Chromecast magic with a new and improved device.

Google is also interested in getting Assistant into more devices. The search giant released a developer preview Google Assistant SDK in late April, letting anyone build the digital helper into any device they create. While many of these gadgets will be of the prototype variety, expect some commercial products to hit the market with Assistant in tow. We'll likely hear plenty more about this initiative during IO.

The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.

Google recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.

This is not to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January. And with video app Google Duo adding voice-only calling on April 10, the chat app waters have gotten even muddier.

What is clear is that there are one too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps the Big G will finally drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.

This was in an effort to ""focus and prioritize"" on the features and apps Google deems most important, and could be just the start of a chat service spring cleaning we'll see the culmination of at IO.

Another likely announcement is the Allo desktop and/or web app, both of which have been teased by Google execs. Users are especially keen to get Allo on the desktop, and it's a good bet Google won't want to disappoint.",techradar
10,Tesla's new moonshot is solar energy — here's why it might just work,"Tesla is a powerhouse in the modern tech world, and for good reason. The company's push for electric cars has captivated consumers, investors and industry observers, and the result is that Tesla is now the most valuable American car company . CEO Elon Musk has even set his sights on overtaking Apple one day in terms of company worth.

More recently, Tesla's focus has broadened, and it's made a different kind of push, one that aims to capture energy from the sun and use it to power people's homes.

The move makes sense. Tesla isn't just a car manufacturer; it's a multi-pronged company aiming for unseen heights in renewable energy. Tesla wants to radically transform how we access and use energy in our everyday lives, and to that end it's spearheading two different products: solar panels and solar roof tiles, also known as the Tesla Solar Roof.

Tesla's solar products are remarkably different than what we're used to seeing. Not only are the designs sleeker than traditional solar panels, but Tesla claims they are also cheaper, and that's before the savings you can expect on your power bill.

There are, of course, plenty of questions. How does Tesla plan to implement this new wave of solar power products? Is its technology really cheaper and more effective than traditional solar panels? Can Tesla pull off completely transforming home energy consumption, forever?

Tesla and solar energy: a brief history

Tesla's mission in solar and beyond is clear: the company wants to re-imagine how we consume energy. You might not know, however, that this plan actually isn't new.

In the 'Secret Tesla Motors Plan (just between you and me),' a blog post written in 2006, Musk described his grand vision to transform Tesla into more than a car company.

""...the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution,"" wrote Musk.

Tesla started laying the groundwork for that transformation long before it announced any solar panel. Critical to using green energy is the ability to store it, and Tesla came up with a way to do just that in the Powerwall. First announced in 2015, the Tesla Powerwall serves as a battery to store energy captured by solar panels and tiles.

Tesla Powerwall battery

The Powerwall stores energy collected from a solar roof or tiles, and even from the electric grid. The stored energy can be used to power a home when there's no sunlight, or when the cost of electricity is higher, such as during the early evening hours.

While the original Powerwall came at a cost of $3,000 or more, the new and improved Powerwall 2 starts at $5,500, largely because it includes a built-in power inverter.

This means the unit will convert captured energy from the sun into energy that can actually be used in your home. Previously, you would had to buy an inverter separately.

With its Powerwall in place, Tesla took an even bigger step in becoming a solar power powerhouse in August 2016 when it purchased SolarCity for $2.6 billion. Founded by Elon Musk's cousin, Lyndon Rive, SolarCity specializes in the installation and development of solar panels. The SolarCity acquisition was a huge deal for Tesla; with SolarCity under its wing, Tesla can deploy full solar systems, complete with solar roofs, batteries, and so on.

Catching rays

Part of the appeal of Tesla's solar solutions are how aesthetically appealing they are: they are sleek, modern-looking, and blend in seamlessly. Tesla proved energy efficiency doesn't have to come at the cost of curb appeal with the Model S and Model X, and it's doing so again with its solar tech.

It's important to reiterate that Tesla has two solar products right now: its more traditional solar panels and the Solar Roof, which looks like standard (yet beautiful) roof shingles, but serve as both roofing and solar panels.

But looks will only take you so far, and Tesla has made its solar solutions functional, too.

The technology used in its tiles is a new form of solar technology, and thus a bit of a change for Tesla.

When Tesla first launched the Model S, it did so using a slew of existing technologies and battery cells built by Panasonic. With its solar tiles, Tesla has tapped a new technology built by Silevo, a company that was acquired by SolarCity for $200 million in 2014. That technology, however, is still somewhat new, and it's unproven in large-scale manufacturing, according to a report from The Buffalo News . So, while the technology works in the lab, it's still unclear if it can be as efficient on a larger scale.

Look just like shingles, right?

The tiles essentially incorporate different layers — a layer of glass on the top, then layers of various films, then solar cells, which convert light into electricity. Silevo technology uses what's called a ""heterojunction cell,"" and while the details of the technology get technical, the point is this: Silevo tech could offer an efficiency of up to 22%, which is greater than averages of between 10% and 15% more traditional panels achieve.

There are still a few things that are a unclear about Tesla's tiles at this point, however. Tesla is expected to use both Silevo and Panasonic technology in its solar products, but these will need to prove they can work considering Silevo is still considered somewhat experimental.

It also appears as though Tesla has taken a step back from Silevo because of its partnership with Panasonic as well, but that doesn't mean it's ditching the tech altogether. Instead, it's likely the technology just needs some more development to be effective on a mass scale.

Tesla's solar panels

Meanwhile, Tesla's solar panels, announced in April 2017, are different than the solar tiles. They look more like traditional panels, albeit sleeker. This is thanks to a much lower profile than other solar panel offerings, making them not as immediately noticeable.

According to Tesla, the panels ""exceed industry standards for durability and lifespan."" The panels aren't actually built by Tesla, but rather by Panasonic, which are then re-sold by Tesla. These don't use the Silevo technology found in the tiles.

'Plug it in and use it'

In addition to a pleasing design, experts argue the intelligence of Tesla's software combined with its Powerwall home batteries will be the real draw to home owners.

Tesla has revealed little about the software behind Powerwall, but on the consumer level it can monitor energy usage in real-time and features intelligence that allows it to automatically adjust its settings according to your usage needs and daily routine. While you don't necessarily need a Powerwall, it helps Tesla solar users get the most out of their panels or tiles.

""Tesla is using existing off-the-shelf battery technology [lithium ion] but bundles its very tech-smart information systems design to make storage just as easy as solar,"" Daniel Kammen, Professor of Energy at the University of California, Berkeley, tells TechRadar. In other words, solar energy is already easy, and Tesla makes storing it just as simple.

""Plug it in and use it,"" Kammen said.

This end-to-end package isn't something other solar companies seem to have mastered: they don't use solar to its full potential, and all the energy captured during the day can't be used at night without a decent battery. With Powerwall, Tesla is delivering a holistic solution to consumers.

Real solar savings?

While solar energy in general saves money on electric bills, it's still expensive to install, so you may not feel like you've saved money for quite some time if you go Tesla's route. Still, the company argues that eventually you will see worthwhile savings on energy use.

According to Tesla, the real savings are to be found in its Solar Roof. And we’re not just talking the cost of the tiles compared to other solar products: Musk said during an earnings call in November that installing its roof is cheaper than installing standard roof tiles. And that's before the money you save from the energy it generates.

""Electricity,"" Musk said, ""is just a bonus.""

Electricity is just a bonus Tesla CEO Elon Musk

But is this claim of cheaper costs true? Well, it's complicated. According to Musk, the solar tiles are cheaper than the cost of concrete or ceramic roof tiles. Those, however, are among the more expensive roof tiles out there, running between $400 and $2,000 per 100 square feet, according to The Motley Fool .

So while Tesla's roofing may end up being cheaper than some traditional materials, it will only be cheaper than the more expensive traditional materials.

Tesla unveiled pricing for its Solar Roof earlier this week, so we can helpfully run the numbers. On average, a Solar Roof will cost $21.85 per square foot for a 3,000-square-foot roof, although that pricing depends on factors like location and the ratio of solar to non-solar tiles you purchase.

Here's what you'll see when Tesla spits out your Solar Roof estimate

Because pricing varies home-to-home, Tesla launched an online calculator to figure out price estimates.

For this story, we plugged in a 3,000-foot-square roof in Sunnyvale, California, and received a roof installation estimate of $79,500, plus $7,000 for the Tesla Powerwall. Undoubtedly that's a lot of money, but for the materials used and the type of roof you're getting, it's actually around the same price as a non-solar roof.

According to Consumer Reports , a traditional Slate Tile roof would cost around $98,500 to install on a 3,000-foot-square roof, making it more expensive than the $79,500 Textured or Smooth Glass roof we calculated for our fictional Sunnyvale home.

What's more, you start saving after the initial install. In California, you would get a $21,000 tax credit for installing such a roof, and Tesla says the roof would generate $113,900 of energy over the next 30 years. At the end of the 30 years, you will have paid off your roof, and generated an extra $48,400 worth of energy. In the long run, your solar roof would cost zero dollars, and you could even make money from it by selling the extra energy.

An important part of Tesla's equation is the ratio of solar tiles to non-solar tiles. Tesla's roofing is actually built from a combination of solar and non-solar tiles, and you can adjust the ratio you want installed. Using fewer solar tiles and more non-solar tiles will result in a cheaper installation cost, but less energy generated.

Tesla's solar tiles are, at least on paper, worth it the investment, even if you weren't thinking of getting a more expensive slate glass roof. Traditional roofing simply can't generate money, and will only cost you in repairs and replacements. Even cheaper asphalt tile roofing, which costs around $20,000 to install on a 3,000-foot-square roof, will cost you more money over time.

And what about the more traditional Panasonic-made solar panels Tesla recently unveiled? Are they more affordable and cost effective than other panels? Unfortunately, we can’t know yet as Tesla hasn't announced pricing for its panels.

We can do a bit of sleuthing, however. Solar Power Authority , which offers quotes for panels, says the average cost of solar panels is around $5-$6 per watt including installation. That puts a 5kW system between $25,000 and $30,000.

Tesla’s Panasonic modules each offer 325 watts, so each module should sit between $1,625 and $1,950. They likely won’t be sold by individual modules, but any less than that would be considered a good price to pay.

Tesla solar takes flight

Tesla is still working on its solar products, and in fact only two of its four solar tile options are available this year, with the others arriving in 2018. The two up for pre-order now are Textured Glass and Smooth Glass, and next year will see Slate Glass and Tuscan Glass.

Tesla's venture into solar may still be in the early stages, but already it's poised to be an influential player in the renewable energy world, helped by unique products, a respected business model and name recognition.

""Tesla has both a fantastic technology solution that is available right now, and a great brand and market research,"" said UC Berkeley's Kammen. ""This is a powerful combination.""

The big question now is whether home owners actually buy a Tesla Solar Roof or panels. Residential solar is on the rise in the US, but while 2016 was the market's biggest year to date, the number of residential solar installations in the country still only totals somewhere above one million, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The climb to widespread residential solar adoption is steep, but with Tesla joining the fray, more homeowners may now consider switching to solar, whether for the installation price, long-term savings, to be an early adopter, or all of the above.

What is clear is Tesla is serious about solar, and we expect to learn about improvements in the technology, cheaper pricing and even more energy products in the months and years to come.",techradar
16,NBC reverses itself and renews Save Our Shows favorite 'Timeless',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The creators shared the shocking news on Twitter. Time

Celebration time: Abigail Spencer, Malcolm Barrett and the rest of the 'Timeless' gang are coming back to NBC after all. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA T)

Apparently, fan voices do count.

In an unusual move, NBC reversed itself Saturday, renewing freshman drama Timeless for a second season. The network had canceled the time-travel adventure series earlier in the week.

The pickup is for 10 episodes, fewer than a traditional renewal order. In a celebratory tweet, co-creator Eric Kripke said Timeless would be back in the summer of 2018, but no return date has been set.

MORE: Check the renewal status of every show

Fans made Timeless the top choice for renewal in USA TODAY's annual Save Our Shows poll, with 49% of participants in a record 146,000-vote turnout wanting to bring it back. It topped 23 other series considered ""on the bubble"" between renewal and cancellation in the poll.

Devotees made their voices heard elsewhere, too, starting an online #RenewTimeless campaign. As of Saturday, a new hashtag was born: #TimelessResuscitated.

In Timeless, Abigail Spencer, Matt Lanter and Malcolm Barrett play characters traveling to different eras in time. In the first season, their assignment was to stop a villain (Goran Visjnic) from changing history.

""The mission was successful,"" Lanter breathlessly told fans in a Facebook Live video Saturday. ""We went back and I'm pretty sure we changed NBC's minds.""

Timeless, which average 8 million viewers per episode, had 16 episodes in its first season, fewer than the 22 that is the general broadcast standard. The last original episode ran in February.

Timeless producers, who also fiercely advocated for the show, celebrated the surprise reversal on Twitter.

Co-creator Shawn Ryan, not the only one to make a time-travel joke, said, ""NBC went back in time and changed history.""

It's true! NBC heard from the fans, went back in time and changed history! #Timeless is getting a Season 2! #TimelessResuscitated! — Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyanTV) May 13, 2017

Kripke made a similar joke, then thanked NBC and fans in a follow-up tweet.

The #TimeTeam went back 3 days, and changed history. @nbc picked us up for 10 episodes. Seriously. Airs next summer. #TimelessRenewedpic.twitter.com/SDkeShlByL — Eric Kripke (@therealKripke) May 13, 2017

So huge thanks to @nbc for supporting us. And THANKS for the fan support. It's a MAJOR reason we're back. It worked, guys! #TimelessRenewed — Eric Kripke (@therealKripke) May 13, 2017

6,Ex-Justice Department officials call for independent counsel in Russia probe,"Former FBI Director James Comey (Photo: Cliff Owen, AP)

A bipartisan group of 179 former federal prosecutors is calling on the Justice Department to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, following President Trump's abrupt firing this week of James Comey as FBI director.

In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the former prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York called Comey a ""highly professional and ethical person."" They said his firing has ""the appearance — if not the reality — of interfering"" with the FBI's ongoing probe into whether Trump's campaign associates colluded with Russians to sway election results.

""Even if this investigation continues unabated, there is a substantial risk that the American people will not have confidence in its results, no matter who is appointed to succeed him, given that the director of the FBI serves at the pleasure of the president,"" the group wrote.

The former prosecutors who signed the letter include Benito Romano, the district's interim U.S. Attorney during President George H.W. Bush's administration; Robert Cleary, who served as U.S. Attorney in New Jersey after working in the New York office; and Richard Ben-Veniste, who was a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal and later served as a member of the bipartisan commission that investigated the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Comey himself spent nearly two years as the U.S. Attorney in the New York-based district before his promotion to deputy attorney general during President George W. Bush's administration. President Obama appointed Comey to a 10-year term as FBI director in 2013.

Earlier this week, Democratic Attorneys General from 19 states and the District of Columbia also called on Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel.

The power to appoint an independent counsel falls to Rosenstein because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the Russian investigation. USA TODAY reported Friday that Rosenstein has indicated he's not yet inclined to appoint a special prosecutor. He is slated to brief senators on the Comey firing next week, according to a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

Trump has denied any collusion between his camp and Russian interests ahead of last November's election and has denounced the investigation as a ""witch hunt.""

MINYA, Egypt — An Egyptian archaeological mission has found a necropolis holding at least 17 mummies near the Nile Valley city of Minya, in the first such find in the area, the antiquities ministry said Saturday.

The discovery was made in the village of Tuna al-Gabal, a vast archaeological site on the edge of the western desert. The area hosts a large necropolis for thousands of mummified ibis and baboon birds as well as other animals. It also includes tombs and a funerary building.

“It’s the first human necropolis to be found here in Tuna al-Gabal,” Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani told reporters at the site, 135 miles south of Cairo. The mummies were elaborately preserved therefore likely belong to officials and priests, he said.

The new discovery also includes six sarcophagi, two clay coffins, two papyri written in demotic script as well as a number of vessels, he said.

The necropolis, which is eight yards below ground level, dates back to the Late Period of Ancient Egypt and the Greco-Roman period, the minister noted.

Pointing to the edges of the necropolis where legs and feet of other mummies could be seen, the minister said that the find “will be much bigger,” as work is currently in only a preliminary stage.

The discovery comes as Egypt struggles to revive its tourism sector, partially driven by antiquities sightseeing, which was hit hard by political turmoil since the 2011 uprising.

The president urged the school's graduating seniors to never give up, regardless of the adversity. (May 13) AP

Capping a week of turmoil over his firing of FBI Director James Comey, President Trump told a crowd of college graduates Saturday they should not be afraid to challenge the establishment or government elites who would second-guess whatever they do.

""Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the same courage,"" Trump said at a commencement speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va.

In an implied blast at his critics, Trump told the Liberty graduates that ""Washington is run by a small group with failed values who think they know everything — we don’t need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives.""

Trump did not specifically mention Comey or other political disputes that have marked his first four months in office, but made repeated general references to his maverick campaign and presidency.

Read more:

At one point, Trump said, ""in my short time in Washington, I've seen first-hand how the system is broken."" At another, he told students and parents at the conservative religious school that ""nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic.""

Trump also praised the military for its battle against the Islamic State and referred at one point to his recent executive order on religious freedom.

Speaking at school that bills itself as the world's largest Christian university, Trump made repeated references to God and the role of faith in society. ""We don’t worship Washington,"" he said. ""We worship God.”

The president also engaged in more traditional commencement rhetoric, congratulating the graduates on their accomplishments and lauding the school's academic credentials and football program. Trump praised the Liberty evangelical community for its political activism, and cited the large support of religious conservatives for his campaign.

""What will you give back to this country and indeed to the world?"" Trump asked the graduates.

Earlier, during the Air Force One ride to southwestern Virginia, Trump told reporters that ""we can make a fast decision"" on a new FBI director, possibly before his departure Friday on a trip to the Middle East and Europe. Trump said he and his staff are looking at ""very well known, highly respected, really talented people, and that's what we want for the FBI.""

Among the names under consideration to be interviewed Saturday, according to a source familiar with the process who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations: Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, former Justice Department Criminal Division Chief Alice Fisher and New York state judge and former U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia.

The search takes place amid an ongoing firestorm over Trump's dismissal of Comey and new questions over whether he taped conversations with the now-former FBI director.

In a Friday tweet, Trump said Comey ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Since that comment, neither Trump nor his aides would confirm or deny questions about whether he in fact tapes conversations.

""I won't talk about that,"" Trump told Fox News in an interview. ""All I want is for Comey to be honest and I hope he will be and I'm sure he will be, I hope.""

Trump, angry over media coverage on the Comey issue, has also threatened to end White House news briefings.

Democrats, and some FBI officials, charge Trump got rid of Comey in order to impede an investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia, which tried to influence the 2016 election by hacking prominent Democrats.

In a commencement address of her own, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, told University of Massachusetts-Amherst graduates they should fight for “the principle that no one, no one in this country is above the law and we need a Justice Department, not an obstruction of justice department.”

Trump has denounced the Russian investigation as a ""hoax"" and ""witch hunt.""

During the commencement address at Liberty's football stadium, Trump lauded students and parents for being ""Champions for Christ."" Saying that ""there may very well be a president or two in our midst,"" Trump encouraged young people to get involved in public life and persevere in the face of criticism.

""A small group of failed voices, who think they know everything, and understand everyone, want to tell everybody else how to live and what to do and how to think,"" Trump said. ""But you aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you are right.""

A fired-up Michelle Obama is defending the nutrition programs she advanced as first lady, saying something is ""wrong"" when the government doesn't want kids to eat healthy meals.

In a speech Friday to the Partnerships for a Healthier America conference, Obama did not mention Trump by name but took issue with changes his administration announced last week to ease some of the school nutrition standards she advanced.

""We gotta make sure we don't let anybody take us back,"" the former first lady said. ""You have to stop and think, why don't you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you? And why is that a partisan issue?""

""Take me out of the equation — like me or don't like me,"" she added. ""But think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap. Why would you celebrate that? Why would you sit idly and be okay with that? Because here's the secret: If somebody is doing that, they don't care about your kid.""

The comments marked the first time Obama has weighed in on the Trump administration's changes to the nutrition policies she helped champion.

On May 1, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the changes, which ease rules on whole grains required in school lunch meals and delay a requirement for further reductions in sodium.

Perdue said the changes were needed to give local programs more flexibility to provide meals that children want to eat.

""If kids aren't eating the food, and it's ending up in the trash, they aren't getting any nutrition,"" he said in a statement announcing the rollbacks.

9,"Bryce Harper, Nationals reach unusual contract deal","Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper is scheduled to become a free agent after the 2018 season. (Photo: Mitch Stringer, USA TODAY Sports)

In an unusual midseason agreement, the Washington Nationals and Bryce Harper came to terms on a one-year contract extension that gives both club and player cost certainty ahead of Harper’s expected free agency after the 2018 season.

The Nationals announced Saturday that they’d reached agreement on a 2018 contract for Harper, with FanRag Sports reporting that it was worth $21.65 million, a record for an arbitration-eligible player. It also includes a reported $1 million bonus should Harper win the 2018 MVP award.

MORE MLB COVERAGE:

While multiyear deals that take arbitration-eligible players to the doorstep of free agency are common – such as Lorenzo Cain’s two-year, $17.5 million deal with Kansas City that expires after this season – an in-season agreement for a player’s forthcoming sixth season are rare. But the Nationals offered Harper a salary number that likely would have exceeded what he would have received via arbitration after 2017.

While it may be just as it appears – a bit of early winter housekeeping – the agreement does indicate a degree of good faith on both sides’ parts. The Nationals could have let Harper play out the season and slot his 2018 salary accordingly.

With Harper off to a fine start – he’s batting .372 with an NL-best .496 on-base percentage, 10 home runs and a 1.213 OPS – the Nationals likely foresaw a significant raise coming, anyway.

And by settling this matter now, it at least shows both sides are talking as Harper approaches a 2018 winter in which he should shatter Alex Rodriguez’s record 10-year, $275 million pact for a free agent.

The Nationals will have significant competition to retain Harper’s services after 2018 – and may have already determined he’ll be too pricey, anyway. But at the least, they have ensured the air will be clear until then – and the club can make a run at a World Series this year and next with the 24-year-old superstar in the fold.",usa-today
3,Pope says he won't try to convince Trump to soften immigration policies,"Pope Francis addresses journalists during the traditional press conference on his flight back to Rome, following a two-day visit at Fatima, Portugal, on May 13, 2017. (Photo: Tiziana Fabi/Pool Photo via AP)

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE — Pope Francis says he won’t try to convince President Trump to soften his policies on immigration and the environment when they meet this month, but wants instead to find common ground and work for peace.

Francis said proselytizing isn’t his style — in politics or religion.

Speaking to reporters while traveling home Saturday from Portugal, Francis said he would say what he thinks sincerely to Trump and listen respectfully to what Trump has to say.

“I never make a judgment about a person without hearing him out,” the pope said.

Speculation has swirled about what Trump and Francis will discuss during their May 24 audience, given that Francis has already said anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is “not Christian.”

Trump, who made building a wall along the border with Mexico a signature campaign promise, responded by saying it was “disgraceful” that the pope would question his faith.

Read more:

Francis said that in talks, he always tries to find “doors that are at least a little bit open” where common ground can be found, particularly in peace-building.

“Peace is artisanal. You do it every day,” he said.

Asked specifically if he would try to soften Trump’s policies, Francis said: “That is a political calculation that I don’t allow myself to make. Also in the religious sphere: I don’t proselytize.”

Trump will call on Francis mid-way through his first foreign trip, after visiting Saudi Arabia and Israel and before attending a NATO summit in Brussels and a G-7 summit in Italy.

Things at Buckingham Palace were a bit more boisterous than usual Saturday.

That's because Prince William, Duchess Kate and Prince Harry welcomed the families of Britain's fallen servicemen and women to the grounds for a Party at the Palace. The invitees included 850 children.

On the agenda: Water-ballon catapult contests, cake decorating, performances from singer Jess Glynne, ventriloquist Nina Conti and magician Lance Corporal Richard Jones, who won Britain's Got Talent last year.

Boos and shouts of ""Liar!"" nearly drowned out her address to students graduating from Bethune-Cookman University. (May 10) AP

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Silencing people with differing opinions has become a pattern on college campuses.

The most recent instance was at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, where Betsy DeVos faced a barrage of non-stop boos during her commencement speech Wednesday. During the Education Secretary's entire 20-minute speech and any time her name was mentioned, the audience heckled her, some screaming ""get the [expletive] out"" and ""shut the [expletive] up."" Angered by her past remarks that historically black schools are the ""real pioneers when it comes to school choice,"" graduates turned their backs to the stage and raised their fists to the ceiling.

""Let’s choose to hear one another out,” DeVos said in a failed attempt to persuade the crowd. “I am here to demonstrate in the most direct way possible that I and the administration are fully committed to your success and to the success of every student across this great country.”

University President Edison Jackson interrupted DeVos at one point and threatened to mail the graduates their degrees if they didn't stop. DeVos sympathizers scolded the students for showing disrespect.

But experts say that was the whole point.

""The whole purpose of protest is to be rude,"" said Pamela Oliver, professor of sociology at University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""It's not like they hadn’t warned the college that they (the students) were upset about it.""

Campus mobs muzzle free speech: Our view

While Oliver considered the protest pretty tame — ""its noisy, but it's not the black bloc, they're not out breaking windows or throwing blocks"" — that isn't always the case.

Protesters at Middlebury College in Vermont vandalized a car and injured a professor when Charles Murray, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist, came to speak in March. Protests against Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos' visit to University of California-Davis ended with one man shot.

At schools across the nation, students have jeered commencement speakers and college visitors they don't agree with — in some cases, blocking them from campus completely.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos gave a speech at Bethune-Cookman University's commencement ceremony. As she spoke, many in the crowd voiced their disapproval. USA TODAY

Students argue that they are just exercising their freedom of speech. But experts say, sometimes the protests go too far, tiptoeing the line between free speech and civil disobedience, which can be punishable by law.

""People get confused. Of course it's not free speech to stop speech,"" said James Weinstein, a professor of constitutional law at Arizona State University. ""Now, that might be civil disobedience. If some neo-Nazi was coming to campus to advocate for the re-enslavement of blacks and extermination of Jews, and you wanted to stop that — is that a matter of civil disobedience? We could have that discussion, but it's certainly not free speech.""

Quashing events with controversial speakers, as was the case at the University of California-Berkeley where conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of a speaking engagement in April, also hampers productive conversations, he added. If we don't listen to each other, Weinstein warned, things are only going to get worse in an already divided time in history.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The choice of DeVos sparked immediate backlash last week among many students and alumni of the Florida university, who signed a petition asking the school to rescind her invitation Time

""I think there's a line between legitimate protest and shutting down an event,"" said Weinstein. ""It isn’t proper for them to try and stop the presentation of ideas that they find offensive or evil, and it certainly isn't promoting free speech.

""It's no more free speech to stop an event than to throw a smoke bomb in the place.""

Harold Pollack, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, agreed there's a fine line between protesting and preventing speakers from being heard.

“If they invited a Holocaust denier to the University of Chicago, I would turn my back on that person, boo them, but I wouldn’t prevent them from speaking,” Pollack said. “From a strategic point of view, the stupidest thing you can do is elevate these figures. The focus is on the misbehavior of those protesting, rather than the low quality of the ideas [the speaker] has to offer in public debate.""

Read more:

Do controversial figures have a right to speak at public universities?

Milo Yiannopoulous' speech at UC-Berkeley canceled as protest turns violent

Even speakers who spew what some consider hate speech have the right to speak, argued Weinstein.

Truman State University in Missouri came under fire in April for inviting Robert Spencer, who runs the conservative website ""Jihad Watch"" and has been classified as a an extremist and anti-Muslim propagandist. It was the same story at Texas A&M when Richard Spencer, who's considered one of the founders of the alt-right movement and a white supremacist, spoke on campus.

""In this country, that kind of speech is legal. We have no hate speech exception in the first amendment,"" said Weinstein. ""Even stopping the most virulent Nazi on campus isn’t free speech; it is civil disobedience.""

But simply booing speakers, as was the case at Bethune-Cookman — although students and alumni did petition school administration to dis-invite her — is usually well within the rights of protesting.

Bethune-Cookman alumnus and current vice president of the American Federation of Teachers Fedrick Ingram, who protested DeVos' visit, was proud of his fellow B-CU Wildcats.

""In the spirit of Mary McLeod Bethune (the school's founder and civil rights activist), I wouldn't expect anything less,"" said Ingram after the ceremony. ""We should never squelch a collective voice of people trying to do the right thing.""

The NAACP has since called for the firing of President Jackson and Chairman of the Board Joe Petrock, who said they hoped the event could be a teachable moment, for inviting DeVos in the first place.

College students have a long history of protesting commencement speakers they don't agree with. Dating back to the 80s, students have challenged the likes of Sen. Rick Santorum, First Lady Barbara Bush, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie, Sen. John McCain, Vice President Dick Cheney and President Barack Obama.

New legislation could change that. In Illinois, Tennessee, Colorado and Arizona, a bill that would prevent colleges and universities from dis-inviting speakers and force them penalize students who obstruct such events is picking up steam.

""Loudly booing, being rude to people, signs with obnoxious pictures or caricatures of Trump or people you disagree with is a long tradition of American protest,” said Pollack.

9,Dana White explains why Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather has to be a boxing match | FOX Sports,"There’s a lot of chatter these days about some of the biggest stars from the UFC testing themselves against their counterparts in the sport of boxing.

Of course the biggest matchup that spurred on this conversation is the rumored bout between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather as the UFC lightweight champion looks to go after boxing’s retired pound-for-pound king.

From the start of the rumors about the proposed super fight, it was always meant to be a boxing match, which favors Mayweather, who is arguably one of the all time greats in that particular sport.

While McGregor may be a massive underdog to Maywaether in the ring, UFC president Dana White says the odds would be insurmountable in a mixed martial arts contest and that’s why he hasn’t heard any boxers calling out his fighters to meet inside the Octagon.

“You notice none of them are clamoring for that one. I like that one a lot better. Any of the big boxers that want to come over here and want to fight our guys, I’m in,” White teased when asked by no boxers have been offering to try out MMA. “Mayweather-McGregor would be over in 15 seconds.”

White has already played out that hypothetical scenario previously when he welcomed multi-time boxing champion James Toney to the Octagon where he faced Hall of Famer Randy Couture in 2010.

The fight lasted less than four minutes.

Obviously, White doesn’t expect any boxers to really want to test the waters in mixed martial arts, but he’s also putting down his foot on any of the fighters in the UFC stepping into the squared circle as well.

White will do everything in his power to put together the fight between McGregor and Mayweather, but that’s where his interest in becoming a boxing promoter comes to an end.

“The biggest one out there is Conor vs. Mayweather. That obviously makes a lot of sense,” White said. “Both guys are huge stars and they both want this fight.

“So most of these other ones make no sense.”",fox-sports

Harper, 25, was the 2012 NL Rookie of the Year and the unanimous 2015 NL MVP, and his pending free agency following the 2018 season already has created speculation about a bidding war – and a potential $400 million mega-contract.

The deal announced Saturday covers only the final season that Harper is under the Nationals’ control, but it does provide a glimpse into the multiyear contract he could ultimately land – in Washington or elsewhere. Harper is making $13.625 million this season.

After a down year in 2016, Harper is slashing .372/.496/.717 with nine doubles, 10 homers, 37 runs and 29 RBI this season.

The deal is a coup for the league, which made signing the 19-year-old starlet a priority as soon as she announced she was foregoing college soccer to turn pro.

Pugh already has 22 caps for the United States and became the youngest American to ever score at an Olympics when she found the back of the net at the 2016 Games. She’s been a fixture with the U.S. ever since and there was talk she would skip college more than a year ago. However, she originally decided to enroll at UCLA, attending classes in the winter, but changed her mind last month and dropped out to play professionally.

No young American has more hype than Pugh, who drew interest not just from NWSL, but also teams abroad. Olympique Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain were reportedly interested in signing her, making the competition for her signature stiff. And while Pugh appeared most interested in staying in the U.S., multiple reports indicated that she didn’t want to play for the Washington Spirit, who had the top pick in the league’s distribution order.

The Spirit have had a rocky existence, with constant roster turnover and controversial ownership. It’s not exactly surprising that Pugh reportedly preferred to play elsewhere, especially when MLS-backed clubs like the Portland Thorns and Houston Dash could provide top-notch facilities and support.

However, U.S. Soccer, which pays the salaries of national teamers in NWSL, and the league were intent on keeping the brightest young American in the American league. U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati even got involved in the negotiations despite being in Bahrain for the FIFA Congress, according to the Washington Post.

With seemingly everyone involved in American women’s soccer working to ensure Pugh would play in NWSL, and with the Spirit, a deal got done. Pugh has a contract and will suit up for the Spirit.

Pugh’s contract with U.S. Soccer, which covers both her national team and Spirit commitments, is almost certainly relatively lucrative, but she will also cash in with endorsement money. She is already speaking with Nike and adidas over a footwear and apparel deal and will add other endorsements.

There are huge expectations for Pugh, which would be daunting for most 19-year-olds. But to this point, Pugh has handled everything thrown her way and shined on the field. Now she’ll try to do the same for the Washington Spirit.",fox-sports

9,Kasper Schmeichel rips referees after Man City's vital win vs. Leicester | FOX Sports,"Kasper Schmeichel was not a happy man following Leicester City’s controversial loss to Manchester City on Saturday. The Foxes’ goalkeeper questioned referee Bobby Madley and his officiating crew’s decision-making and consistency following the 2-1 loss at the Etihad.

City’s first goal in the 29th minute came after Leroy Sane’s cutback pass into the box found David Silva, who slotted it to Schmeichel’s far post. Teammate Raheem Sterling, who was offside, swung a leg at it but didn’t touch it and the goal was allowed to stand. That’s where Schmeichel first took issue with the officiating after the match, via SkySports.

“The first goal is offside. Anybody who has played football, especially in goal, will know it’s offside. If he’s in the six-yard box and the ball is going by him, past my line of sight, that means he’s interfering. It doesn’t even matter if he goes for it, he’s interfering because I can’t see the ball. “Fuchs can’t get to the ball because he’s stood in the way of him and prevents him from swinging his foot at the ball. Then he swings his foot at the ball, so he’s made an attempt. So three times he’s offside. It’s one of these very frustrating decisions because we’d done well up until then and we kind of lost our composure for five or 10 minutes and they got the second one.”

The Foxes also had a late penalty disallowed, as Riyad Mahrez slipped during the attempt and sent a shot that deflected off his plant foot into the Manchester City net. Madley saw the double-touch and rightly disallowed the goal, but Schmeichel bemoaned the lack of consistency among referees. The Danish keeper cited Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann’s penalty against Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals, where a double touch also took place but wasn’t noticed.

“Griezmann did it in the semi-final and it stood, so you talk about consistency,” he told SkySports. That penalty would have equalized the match in the 77th minute, but Madley waved it off.

The result doesn’t mean much for Leicester on the whole, but it’s a massive result for Man City and the other Premier League teams in the hunt for a top-four spot. A full three points put the Citizens in third place with 72 points, two above Liverpool in the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot. It increased the distance between City and Arsenal, too, who entered the day on 66 points prior to their match against Stoke.

Schmeichel’s comments will likely fall on deaf ears, as referees and officials rarely comment after matches, but he can rest assured that plenty of people are on his side — Man City’s rivals chief among them.",fox-sports
9,Gareth Bale still hasn't returned to training as injury could keep him out from trophy chases | FOX Sports,"Gareth Bale still isn’t training with the team, Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane revealed on Saturday. The update comes as the Merengues get ready for what Zidane has called “four finals” in pursuit of La Liga and Champions League crowns.

“We have to see day to day with Gareth Bale,” he told reporters at a news conference. “He is continuing in the gym, working, trying to get rid of his discomfort.

“It’s getting better, but you have to go day by day. But he’s not even training with us. I cannot tell you when he will return, but hopefully it is soon.”

Bale hurt his calf in Real Madrid’s Champions League quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich. The injury wasn’t called season-ending at the time, but it’s looking like it could be now.

Real Madrid have three La Liga matches in the next two weeks, and if they win all three then they will win the league crown. Then on June 3, the Merengues have the Champions League final, where they will attempt to be the first team to win the tournament in consecutive seasons.

That timeline leaves Bale three weeks to get healthy enough to play. That’s not very long for a player who still can’t train with the rest of the team, and now it’s starting to look possible that he doesn’t see the field again this season. That would mean Real Madrid playing their “four finals” without him as they chase two trophies.

4,When Only Memories Can Fill The Cracks,"When I was a teenager, I drew the floor plan of my house a lot. It helped me tell stories about my family, where it was important to understand the view I had from my bedroom, or that there was a dividing half-wall between the kitchen and the living room in an otherwise open concept house. I’d draw lines to illustrate the trajectory of our tiny dog, who’d ricochet against the fridge, scramble down the hallway, bank off the doorframe into my parents’ bedroom, and steal a pair of socks. If I adjusted the scale of my drawing, I could show how close the house was to a nearby conservation area, and to the river beside where I’d sneak cigarettes and spray myself with CK One perfume before returning home, as though my mother wasn’t wise to the fact that the wooded areas of Guelph don’t smell like department store fragrance. My parents sold that house last fall, and moved into my mother’s childhood home — Nonna’s house, to me. Nonna is still alive, but her dementia means she’s been relocated to a retirement community, leaving her house empty. It wasn’t an easy process: My parents, looking to downsize, hadn’t found anything suitable after two years of looking. And Nonna, fiercely independent and living alone since the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier, wasn’t ready to let the house leave the family. She might not have ever moved were it not for the dementia, which, as a byproduct of its gradual erasure of Nonna’s memory, had made it dangerous for her to live alone. Once my parents bought the house, they began the physically necessary but emotionally taxing work of making it their own: a full reno, new appliances, new furniture. In addition to Nonna herself, most of the stuff that reminded me of her — the baby-blue shag carpet, the just-for-show purple towels in the upstairs bathroom, the Jesus portrait hanging above the staircase — is gone too. Nonna, for most of my life, would spend hours in conversation with me — in person at her house in Guelph, then over the phone once I moved to Toronto. Last time I saw her, she remembered me as her “granddaughter,” and that took 30 minutes. Nonna is physically recognizable to me, but the version of her who exists in my mind — the woman who anchored my family down — now lives only in the objects I connected to my formative memories of her: The kitchenwares, framed photographs, and textiles that were split among her living family members after my parents bought the house. They were once just home furnishings, but are now a direct line to a person in the midst of being erased. When I think of my parents’ new house, I draw the floor plan to Nonna’s house in my head. Then I fill it with all her physical belongings, the ones that still remind me of her, the ones I couldn’t save and that I’ll never see again. Even though Nonna is still alive, I include her.

When architects go on digs, the artifacts they uncover serve as irrefutable scientific evidence of the past. But they’re also objects that connect us to this past on a more visceral, sentimental level than carbon-dating. Physical artifacts can, to the trained eye, go well beyond confirming the existence of history — these objects tell us about habits, customs, fears, superstitions, victories celebrated and losses mourned; they tell us that people existed, and they tell us who those people were.

When my mother’s family moved to Canada from Northern Italy in 1959, they were stuff-less by necessity because there was no home ready for such things. The four of them — my mother, her older sister, and my Nonna and Nonno — first rented part of a house in a predominantly Italian neighbourhood in Guelph, later renting a whole house, all the while saving money for the plot of land they would eventually buy not far away by slowly buying only the stuff they needed: A matching pink couch, loveseat and chair, and a tufted, brocade couch for the basement; a television with knobs you’d twist to change the channels; a solid-wood kitchen table, so massive and imposing I always imagined they lowered it in with a crane before the house had a roof. After her husband died in 1984 — and, I think, even before — Nonna didn't replace things often, if ever, giving the impression that everything I ever knew Nonna to own was all she had ever owned.; Iin my mind she and her furniture, her pots and pans, her plates and cooking tools, are all inextricable from her. iThey were always in the same place (and, consequently, talways in the same place as her),and always in the same condition. Nonna and her things were constants, and while the stuff wasn't expensive or elaborate, but it was hers. She favoured olds sets of dishes for weeknight dinners of meaty pasta or perfect fried chicken cutlets with garlicky, parsley-studded mushrooms, and ancient tupperware for food storage. When things broke a little, she kept using them; when they broke a lot, she would fix them. There was a system to the way things were cared for: No plate or glass ever hit the kitchen table without a coaster or placemat beneath. Nonna cared about her home and possessions not because they were expensive, but because she bought them with her own money, and kept them in good shape. Her independence reflected in the purchase, the care, and the maintenance of a set of powder-pink living room furniture that may well have been brand new if not for their sort of awful late-60s hue. The way Nonna viewed her home and her things reflected how she viewed herself (and vice versa): With meticulous grooming, diligent upkeep, and the ability to either work around breaks as they happened, or fix them on her own. She cared for herself like a person who had the potential for permanence. There came a point when things began to degrade beyond her capacity for repair and upkeep. At first, this had to do mainly with Nonna’s physical limitations. It was difficult for her to descend the stairs to vacuum the basement, for example, so the rec room became permanently sealed off. Soon, my family was beginning to pitch in with laundry and small household chores. Without Nonna’s diligence, the house began to show its age. The plates, pans and utensils in her cupboards collected dust as they fell into disuse — she’d still cook sometimes, sure, but she didn’t have the energy for family dinners anymore. And sometimes, the recipes tasted just a bit off, like she’d forgotten a step, or confused the measurements for a couple of ingredients. She became anxious, distracted, and confused. But despite the physical evidence collecting around her — the house and everything in it, spotless and new for decades, was suddenly old and worn — Nonna denied there was anything wrong. Four years ago, she left a pot of water on the stove so long it was blackened beyond the point of cleaning or repair. She had completely forgotten it was there. In any other context, the incident might have been innocuous, but for Nonna — who had already been slowly losing grip on her stuff, her home, her independence — it was a tipping point. lLiving alone was no longer safe. My family began discussions about moving her to a retirement home, which involved discussions about what would come of her house, and of course, all her things. Near the end of Nonna’s time at the house, that kitchen table — around which we’d gather every Christmas, and at least on Sunday a month — began to crack right down the middle. The springs on the basement couch had become so worn, you’d almost hit the floor if you sat on it. And and who wanted a television that forced you to walk up to it just to change the channel? As anyone who’s divided an estate will tell you, the conversation around a loved one's possessions revolves largely around one question: What do you want? Some things were readily spoken for — the only two pots that remained of the set shipped over from Italy went to my mother and aunt. An espresso set, long coveted by one of my cousins, was set aside for him. The basement furniture, all of it worn by time or by the misuse of my sister and I, was donated or trashed. Last Easter, my sister and I sat down in my aunt’s basement to divide the possessions that had been set aside for us — mostly things from the kitchen. What was initially a conversation of utility, of looking at objects and determining, as I always do when deciding what I should own, whether they’re of actual use to me, became an exercise in remembering Nonna through her possessions. Things became impossible to discard. When presented with the physical manifestation of every Sunday dinner I’d ever eaten, invisibly imprinted with the memory of the woman who cooked them as I watched over her shoulder. I couldn’t imagine living without any of it. I took broken Tupperware that might have once carried leftover lasagna from Nonna’s house to ours, and a full set of cutlery despite already owning more than enough forks. I took a giant gilded soup tureen that I had never even seen before, because I knew it was part of a set that had been carefully carried over on a boat, in 1959, and an awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot whose only use, as far as I can tell, is boiling water. I wrapped it all up in a set of rags—threadbare after years of use dusting the framed photos of Nonno, which, along with some wedding gifts and pieces of jewellery, were the only sentimental things I knew Nonna to own—that are now vacuum sealed and packed away, to preserve Nonna’s crisp hemmed edges, never again to be used for their intended purpose. In Nonna’s things, I can still see her the way I remember her best: Proudly self-sufficient and independent. And if I keep her things clean, in good working order and in good repair, I feel like I can keep that Nonna — the one she herself fought to maintain, the one she tried for so long to deny we were all losing, the one who, in reality, disappeared many years ago — alive forever.

The last time I talked to Nonna on the phone, it was on her 87th birthday. She told me that she was very old now, that she hadn’t really felt up to doing anything that day. She asked if I was happy with my job and my apartment. Then she thanked me for calling and said goodbye. No “I love you.” Until four or five years ago, Nonna would repeat her “I love yous” at the end of a phone call until I had no choice but to hang up on her. I don’t doubt that she still loves me; it’s more likely that these days, after a few minutes, she doesn’t remember who called.

When I was younger, I took for granted what an indomitable force Nonna was. She lived alone and kept a home by herself for three decades, while acting as an emergency contact for my entire family, no matter what we needed: A ride, a loan, a night off. She could be difficult and demanding, but we were close. I was patient with her when she struggled with English, and, later, eager to learn from her when she cooked. When she still lived at home but had begun to experience waking nightmares, I spent a night there, and she felt safe enough to sleep through the night. In my adult life, I have used Nonna’s immovable spirit of independence as a guiding principle. Now, her loss of independence is devastating because it means I have lost the part of her of which I was most in awe, but also, because I am terrified of someday losing my own. The same things that happened to Nonna will probably happen to me, with or without dementia. I might not be able to wash the plates I took from her kitchen to mine, because they’re too heavy. My eyesight might prevent me from patching up small holes in t-shirts and dish cloths, and my back — which is already in bad shape, frankly — could make it hard for me to vacuum my carpets. I might forget how to cook the things I most love to eat. I will get old, and I will fight back against age as it claws back against my ability to do things for myself. And I, like Nonna, might refuse to negotiate and to accept that I simply can’t do things the way I used to. Frankly, I probably will: I’ve adopted a lot of Nonna’s obstinate self-sufficiency. I wonder if I’ll forget her awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot on the stove someday, and I wonder who will decide what happens to all of the things I’ve inherited from Nonna after I’ve forgotten that most of them ever existed in the first place. When I first saw how my parents had changed Nonna’s house, was like one of those dreams where you know you’re at your old high school but everything looks like your best friend’s kitchen. The cognitive disconnect was overwhelming. On an early visit, I ran my hand along one of the hallway walls, wondering if I’d be able to physically register that it now ends sooner than it used to. I’d close my eyes while sitting on the new, grey couch and pretend I was still sitting on the old, pink one; a feat of imagination assisted by a living room window that’s still the same width and height that it used to be. Though, with horizontal blinds replacing the old vertical ones — and slightly less light coming in — it feels like everything has gotten a bit colder, and a bit smaller. The truth is actually kind of the opposite: Nonna’s furniture took up so much more space than the stuff my parents own. Especially the table. And somehow, they lifted the massive wood one that hosted all the Christmas dinners, coffees, and conversations we never had anywhere else, and moved it out of the house. Nobody saved it. The crack down its middle had deepened into a chasm; the solid foundation that had once supported our family gatherings was being gradually replaced by a widening, empty gulf, unyielding as it was irreparable.",buzzfeed

6,The high stakes of the Comey controversy,"Those shocks will continue to reverberate next week and beyond because the issues involved are fundamental to American democracy, challenging the credibility of the White House and the vital legal institutions that sustain government.

As always in politics, timing is everything, and the timing here raises questions about the use and possible abuse of presidential power: Why did Trump do it? And more importantly, why now?

Orchestrating the chaos, as always, was Trump himself, who largely stayed out of public view last week but managed to incite pandemonium nonetheless.

In a dizzying sequence of events, sacked acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned in Senate testimony Monday that ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn was a ripe blackmail target for Russia while in office. The President suddenly fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, and then blindsided his own vice president with his shifting reasoning before sabotaging the White House press operation that was trying to defend him. Amid reports he demanded a loyalty pledge from Comey, critics warned Trump was guilty of a grotesque abuse of power, or even worse. But the President was not done. He suggested that Comey's investigation into links between his presidential campaign and Russia were indeed the reason he was fired.

In a Friday morning tweetstorm, he seemed to suggest he had a Nixon-style White House taping operation, and told Comey to stay mum. Next, he proposed ending press briefings because it's impossible for his communications team to keep up with the whiplash of his stream-of-consciousness presidency.

Trump's behavior provoked confusion and criticism in Washington. But the President is defiant and may have had his detractors in mind as he delivered a commencement address Saturday at Liberty University, in Virginia.

""No one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sideline saying why it can't be done,"" Trump said. ""Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic.""

View from afar

Meanwhile, out in the country, the political contagion is spreading.

In North Dakota, tempers boiled over at a town hall event hosted by Rep. Kevin Cramer. A man demanded to know whether the rich would benefit from the repeal of Obamacare and was escorted out by police after trying to shove a wad of cash into Cramer's collar.

Republican Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan was shouted down by constituents shouting ""health care for all.""

GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur, who helped pass the Obamacare repeal bill, walked into a metaphorical bear pit in his New Jersey district. ""Open your eyes!"" screamed one anti-Trump voter.

In West Virginia, a reporter was arrested after firing a string of questions at Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.

At times, in Washington and elsewhere, it seemed as thought the country's political equilibrium was at grave risk. It's now normal to observe that Trump is not like a conventional politician, that the point of his political project is to flout norms and shake up the cozy establishment and that the press takes him too literally.

And when Trump behaves in a way that has the media and Washington establishment types running around with their hair on fire, his loyal base of voters who sent him to the White House see a mission accomplished.

Loyalty

There's also no sign that congressional leaders are ready to desert him. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for instance, said Friday: ""I've decided I'm not going to comment on the tweets of the day or the hour.""

Trump went back to his seemingly impervious well of political support Friday, in a fundraising drive emailed to supporters in which he said : ""Let's show the hypocrites, liars, and 'elites' of Washington that the American people are dead serious about our mission to DRAIN THE SWAMP.""

But despite the loyalty of his base and for all the cacophony of the last three months, and the riotous campaign in 2016, the last week has seemed different. It felt at times that the White House was spinning off its political axis, that the President was isolated even from his own staff and that there was little rhyme or reason behind his increasingly erratic statements.

Trump's often frazzled but loyal press secretary Sean Spicer was even asked in his daily briefing on Friday whether Trump was ""out of control.""

""That's, frankly, offensive,"" Spicer said.

Yet, so extreme have been the events of the last few days that such a question -- which many would view as outrageous in more normal times -- didn't seem out of bounds.

Wild ride

While Trump has taken America on a wild ride since taking office, things did appear to get substantially more surreal and serious this week, with the possibility even looming that the President had edged closer to legal jeopardy with his stunning decision to can Comey while he was overseeing the Russia probe.

Spicer's stand-in, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, meanwhile, made a series of statements about Comey's popularity within the bureau and the scope of the FBI investigation that were comprehensively refuted by acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe in congressional testimony on Thursday.

Some Republicans are worried about the trajectory of Trump's presidency amid concern that a distracted White House could squander its opportunity to use a GOP majority to reshape the country's politics.

""This is ridiculous, it is not tenable and Republicans ... just politically, this cannot last, so go ahead and start holding the President accountable, the bogeyman is not going to come out from under your bed,"" Amanda Carpenter, a former communications aide to Sen. Ted Cruz said on ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Friday. ""Donald Trump's special police are not going to come get you in the middle of the night.""

""If you say, 'Mr. President, please respect the three branches of government. Please respect the American institution as it's supposed to work' ... you will be much better off,"" said Carpenter, a CNN commentator.

But beyond the politics, there's another element to the Trump presidency that makes it so discombobulating for many people.

Thanks to the President's mastery of social media, it's hard to escape him. He sometimes seems to be lurking on every device, from your iPhone to your laptop to your television, and thus barges into countless conversations or social occasion. If nothing else, by the end of his presidency, America may face the political equivalent post traumatic stress disorder. And the societal damage from Trump's perpetual war on institutions like the intelligence agencies, the courts and the media might take may years to assess.

In that sense, Friday's tweet storm blasting Comey and the ""fake media"" was just the capstone of a madcap week.

Timothy Naftali, a CNN historian and former director of the Nixon Library, suggested that the President would do well to reconsider his approach.

""I believe the President of the United States needs to think about his credibility,"" Naftali told CNN's Kate Bolduan, referring to Trump's response to the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling. Though there was no evidence he was guilty of anything, Trump is acting like he is, Naftali said.

""This is bigger than him, he is our head of state, he is our bald eagle, he represents our country. Perhaps there might be a time for a little bit of a moment and little reflection ... perhaps he might want to think about his conduct more seriously than he has up to now,"" he said.

Credibility

But it is not just Trump whose credibility seemed tarnished after his week. The reputation of his press shop has also taken a hit.

The suddenness of Comey's firing took the White House communications team by surprise, but they quickly built a rationale that the reason Comey was gone was a damning report on his handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe complied by the new deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.

It didn't seem remotely credible, but at least it was something. Within hours the tale was unraveling, but not before Vice President Mike Pence had put his own reputation on the line by peddling it to reporters on Capitol Hill.

Even though White House aides insisted repeatedly the firing had nothing to do with Russia, they were finally and disastrously undermined by their own boss.

""In fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,'"" Trump told NBC in an interview.

His comments made an already dicey job for Spicer's team all but impossible.

""I think the credibility is gone, and I'm really sorry to say that,"" said John Kirby, a former State Department and Pentagon spokesman who is now a CNN analyst.

""I don't think there is a crisis of credibility, I think it is shot, and I don't know how they ever get it back,"" Kirby said.

Some Republicans are meanwhile worried that the trust that has eroded in a fraught political time for the White House will leave the administration flailing when an inevitable international or national crisis flares.

""Having the President undermine the credibility of his staff makes their jobs harder not just today but moving forward,"" said Republican strategist Doug Heye on CNN.

""This White House has had a lot of crises but not a real true crisis yet. When that crisis hits, Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, they need credibility in front of those reporters who are going to be gunning after them and the President hurt them today. That is a real challenge for this White House.""",cnn
6,"Isolated and agitated, Trump rattles White House from within","Washington (CNN) A buoyant President Donald Trump reemerged into public for the first time in more than a week on Friday, offering few signs of the malaise that has gripped his administration since the hasty dismissal of FBI Director James Comey.

""It's such an honor to be here,"" Trump declared to a group of military mothers gathered in the East Room for a Mother's Day event. ""So bright and festive.""

Downstairs, the mood was anything but.

In conversations with multiple advisers, conducted on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, officials described to CNN a sense of dejection within the West Wing ranks, where most aides were caught off guard by Trump's decision and had little ability to develop a cogent response. Even Vice President Mike Pence, who found his public statements again undercut by Trump himself, was ""a little rattled"" at the events of the week, according to an administration adviser.

Through it all, Trump has remained largely out of sight, not leaving the White House once since he returned late Sunday night. He grew increasingly isolated and agitated, associates tell CNN, going a full week without hearing the applause and adulation that often brightens his mood.

Eager to move on

The President's public schedule has been devoid of opportunities for the press to see him since last Thursday. The absence came on a week when his decision to fire Comey consumed Washington; the President acted as an invisible central player to the drama, tweeting in spurts about alleged links between his campaign and Russia while largely remaining entrenched behind closed doors at the White House.

The quiet stretch was long-planned, officials said, with little expectation that Trump would deliver a bombshell. Instead, many in Trump's circle now view the past four days as the worst stretch of Trump's presidency so far. All are eager to move on.

""I think a lot of people are trying to figure out the new dynamic in town,"" one senior White House official said Friday, conceding the learning curve was often just as steep for those working steps from the Oval Office as across town.

Some of the more seasoned aides inside the West Wing refer to Trump as ""the hurry-up president,"" full of risk and reward. But this week, aides bluntly conceded, the risks were far more apparent. It was a fresh reminder the administration is not prepared to deal with a crisis of its own making, never mind a catastrophe outside its control.

Still, inside the West Wing the mood appeared to lift somewhat by the end of the week, as one exhausted aide declared, ""It's Friday.""

Trump, in both individual meetings and larger sessions, personally worked to bolster his staff's plummeting morale after rampant criticism of their inability to cast his firing of Comey in a positive light.

But the scars were still apparent, with one White House official asking: ""Do you think we're liars?""

And just as some aides began to feel on firmer footing after Comey's dismissal, Trump revived his longtime obsession with surveillance, suggesting that he was recording conversations inside the Oval Office. Neither Trump nor his spokesman tamped down on the implication, a telling development for a White House not shy about publicly rebutting what it claims is false reporting.

Another distraction

It was another distraction from a governing agenda that, only a week ago, appeared on track. Comey clean-up efforts largely crowded out attempts to move on to other items, leading to fears among White House staff that Trump's governing agenda may be derailed.

Aside from vague references to rebuilding the military during his Mother's Day remarks, Trump has otherwise made no mention of policy in public since Thursday of last week, when his administration hit its high mark after passage of a GOP health care bill in the House of Representatives.

When he did emerge for a pair of interviews, Trump only seemed to deepen questions about the episode. He told NBC News on Thursday that he was thinking about the Russia probe when he made the call to dismiss the man overseeing it. He added he had long ago decided Comey must go.

Both seemed to directly contradict the ways Trump's aides -- including Pence -- had been working to salvage the Comey storyline.

After Trump told NBC that he'd long planned to fire Comey -- and was not, as Pence declared seven times on Capitol Hill Wednesday, acting on the advice of his Justice Department -- the Vice President found himself again in a position of being contradicted by his boss.

""He's not rattled very often and he was a little rattled"" about how the events transpired, a senior administration adviser said.

According to this adviser, Trump made the decision to fire Comey -- and Pence knew the decision was coming before the announcement on Tuesday -- but he wasn't fully briefed on the President's reasoning for firing Comey before he went in front of cameras on Wednesday.

""He went out there without all the information,"" the adviser said. ""It was not an attempt to lie.""

Other advisers found themselves in similar positions. Briefing reporters at the same time Trump spoke in the East Room Friday, press secretary Sean Spicer struggled to explain multiple shifts in the timeline surrounding Comey's firing or the motivations behind it. Perhaps more worrisome, he wasn't able to say whether conversations in Trump's White House were being recorded -- a possibility Trump raised himself on Twitter Friday morning.

""The President has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer said.

Indeed, Trump himself told a Fox interviewer that he wouldn't talk about whether he'd recorded conversations with his canned FBI director.

In the public eye

Trump resumes a more robust public schedule starting Saturday. He'll deliver a commencement address at Liberty University, the evangelical institution in Lynchburg, Virginia. Next week he welcomes the leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Colombia for talks and delivers another graduation speech at the US Coast Guard academy in New London, Connecticut.

And he departs on a five-stop foreign swing on Friday, though the grueling pace of presidential foreign travel isn't likely to provide much relief for a beleaguered president.

For some aides, a departure from Washington can't come quickly around. Those around Trump are eager to get him out of the White House and outside of Washington as soon as possible, according to a source close to the White House. Trump generally basks in crowd settings, though he has traveled far less than his predecessors.

""We need to get the President outside the beltway,"" this source said.

'Meltdown mode'

Republican allies on Capitol Hill also hope the President can soon resume his push for key items of his legislative agenda, including a massive tax reform package that the White House promised in broad terms last month, but has since gotten little attention.

Trump's legislative affairs operation has largely gone quiet since the health care victory last week. On Tuesday, as senators hunkered down on Capitol Hill to hammer out their own version of the health bill, Trump was executing his plan to fire Comey; the news dominated conversations among lawmakers for the rest of the week.

When House Speaker Paul Ryan visited Ohio on Wednesday, he wanted to talk about tax reform. But headlines from his event largely focused on his refusal to comment about Comey's firing.

One Republican congressional source described the White House in ""meltdown mode"" as it scrambled to contain the Comey fallout.

Ryan himself worked to avoid the topic during an appearance in Wisconsin Friday.

""I'm going leave it to the President to talk about and defend his tweets,"" he said when asked about Trump's suggestion he may be recording his Oval Office meetings.

But Ryan seemed to acknowledge that, at least for the next four years, there will be little certainty coming from the White House.

6,Trump thinks he can get away with anything,"Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University and a CNN political analyst, is the author of "" The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society. "" He's co-host of the ""Politics & Polls"" podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

This week's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey has greatly intensified the fears that our commander in chief sees absolutely no boundaries to his power.

By axing the director of an agency investigating whether there was collusion between members of his campaign and Russians, Trump risked being seen as obstructing a criminal investigation. He then piled on by tweeting out a threat to Comey should he leak information to the media. If Trump obstructed justice, it would be fair to say this scandal could be worse than Watergate.

In retrospect, the most revealing moment in the 2016 campaign occurred when Trump said at a campaign rally in January, ""I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters."" The statement perfectly captures the mentality of the leader who holds the keys to power in the United States.

Besides his own sense of self, Trump's arrogance about what is possible comes from his counting on many aspects of our political system to protect him from political or legal punishment. There are some important differences between American politics in 2017 and 1974 that could insulate him from the fallout that President Richard Nixon faced.

Partisanship much stronger

Trump has always depended on the fact that partisanship is the most powerful force in the electorate. When he ran against Hillary Clinton, he anticipated that, in the end, Republicans would back him over any Democrat regardless of what he did or said. His dependence on partisanship remains a pillar of his political strategy. And there is reason for him to feel this way. It was notable that hours after the news of Comey's departure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he would not support the appointment of a special prosecutor.

The level of partisanship is much stronger than it was in final days of Nixon's presidency, when a group of Republicans, including Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and House Minority Leader John Rhodes, finally approached the President to say that the time had come to step down. They told him he had lost his support in Congress.

Today there are real questions about whether Republican leaders would ever do the same thing. If most party leaders in the House and Senate hold firm in defense of the President, Trump understands that -- at least until the 2018 midterm elections -- party discipline would curtail the scale and scope of any congressional investigation.

Friends in the media

The news media is also very different than it was in the early 1970s. President Trump counts on the existence of powerful conservative news outlets that have the capacity and the will to counteract damaging news stories about what he has done.

In recent days, Fox News has been working hard to blame the media , saying it is blowing this story out of proportion. Their web site is also running a headline that the new FBI Chief could reopen the case about Hillary Clinton's emails, throwing their readers some red meat as the President struggles.

While conservative news shows feed the electorate with alternative narratives about what is going wrong in Washington, social media now floods voters with fake news that confuses many people about what they should believe. With so much disinformation circulating in the political ecosystem, President Trump will count on his opponents having trouble building sustained support for an investigation, and possibly impeachment.

Trump knows he can find support in the conservative media to counteract the 2017 version of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the reporters whose work helped lead to Nixon's resignation.

Changing the subject

Trump no doubt depends on the idea that the short attention span of the country helps him survive this crisis. We move at a much faster pace today than in the early 1970s.

In this respect, the issue is not whether the public supports or opposes what he has done, but that Americans will quickly move on to the next story. President Trump will do everything in his power to make that happen with more outrageous statements and actions.

He can also accelerate discussions about high-profile policies such as tax cuts to redirect the energy of legislators who might otherwise focus on the Russia scandal. That tactic worked well in the campaign, during which voters could barely keep up with every new Trumpism. Effective investigations take time in our political system. The legislators who conduct them need to feel support from constituents over months, not days. It is not clear if the public can sustain this. If they don't, legislators will lose their sense of urgency about staying focused on this investigation.

During the campaign, Trump counted on the fact that many people hated politics enough that they would tolerate his outlandish ways. The President continues to rely on people concluding that today's news doesn't seem any worse than what they normally perceive to be going on in the ""swamp"" of Washington. Disillusionment with politics is so strong that public attitudes could insulate him.

But maybe, just maybe, this time President Trump went too far. The decision to fire James Comey and the string of lies that followed that decision feel different to many observers. President Trump seems to have really slipped into the realm of President Richard Nixon.

There is ample evidence to suggest that the President either lashed out at Comey because he was angry about the Russia investigation or, even worse, is attempting to cover this up and obstruct the investigation. When Trump threatened Comey in a tweet, it was impossible not to feel like this was 1974 all over again. With stories emerging that he had asked Comey several times whether he would be loyal, the determination of President Trump to contain this investigation becomes clearer by the hour.

The big question is not only what Trump did and when he did it, but whether the many parts of our political system that this president has counted on to save him will finally start to crumble. Most important is the question of whether there will be any profiles of courage -- Republican leaders who step in, just as they did in 1974, to say that this is enough and guarantee a full investigation as well as punitive actions should they be necessary. They should keep in mind that at this rate, when this story comes to an end, many historians might conclude that the comparison of the current situation to Watergate was unfair -- but to President Nixon rather than to Trump.

Americans can't assume that the system will work. It will take immense political pressure on legislators in the coming weeks to make certain that our leaders use every mechanism available to discover and prevent abuse of power and to ensure the health of our democracy for future generations.",cnn
6,"Clapper on collusion between Russia, Trump aides: There could be evidence","Story highlights He says the Russia investigation is a ""dark cloud"" hanging over the White House

He also said the FBI didn't lose faith in Comey

Washington (CNN) Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC'S Andrea Mitchell on Friday that there could be evidence of collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign -- a statement that comes on the heels of an apparent public threat Trump made this morning to fired FBI Director James Comey, tweeting that Comey had better hope their conversations have not been taped.

""There was no evidence that rose to that level, at that time, that found its way in to the intelligence community assessment, which we had pretty high confidence in,"" the former director of national intelligence said of collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russians, referring also to the US intelligence assessment that Russia tried to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump. ""That's not to say there wasn't evidence, but not that met that threshold.""

When asked whether the FBI's Russia investigation is fake news, or a ""witch hunt,"" as Trump called it this morning in another tweet, Clapper told MSNBC on Friday: ""I don't believe it is.""

""But that's kind of irrelevant,"" he continued. ""I think what needs to happen here is to clear this cloud, a cloud that's hanging over the administration, over the President, over the White House. It would be in everyone's best interest to get to the bottom of this, and for the country. Otherwise this is going to continue to linger as a dark cloud, in my opinion, over this administration.""

Clapper's remarks come after Trump tweeted that Clapper had said there is no collusion between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia.

16,Ransomware: World reels from massive cyberattack,"Organizations around the world were digging out this weekend from what experts are calling one of the biggest cyberattacks ever.

Hospitals, major companies and government offices were hit by a virus that seeks to seize control of computers until the victims pay a ransom.

Experts said that even as the spread of the attacks apparently has been stymied, its full ramifications are not yet known because the virus may be lurking still on computers around the world.

Cybersecurity firm Avast said it had identified more than 75,000 ransomware attacks in 99 countries on Friday, making it one of the broadest and most damaging cyberattacks in history.

Avast said the majority of the attacks targeted Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan. But U.K. hospitals, Chinese universities and global firms like Fedex (FDX) also reported they had come under assault.

Security experts said the spread of the ransomware had been inadvertently stopped late Friday. The ransomware was designed to repeatedly contact an unregistered domain in its code. A 22-year-old security researcher in the U.K, who goes by MalwareTech, registered that domain to analyze the attack, but it turned out the ransomware needed it to remain unregistered to keep spreading.

""Thus by registering it we inadvertently stopped any subsequent infections,"" he told CNNTech.

However, a hacker could change the code to remove the domain and try the ransomware attack again.

Related: When should spies tell companies that their systems can be hacked?

It remained unclear how many organizations had already lost control of their data to the malicious software -- and researchers warned that copycat attacks could follow.

Europol said Saturday that the attack was of an ""unprecedented level and requires international investigation."" And the U.K. government called an emergency meeting over the crisis.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, at a meeting of world leaders in Italy, said the attack was a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity. ""It's a big priority of mine that we protect the financial infrastructure,"" he said.

The ransomware, called WannaCry, locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them. The exploit was leaked last month as part of a trove of NSA spy tools.

Related: How to protect yourself from the ransomware attack

The ransomware is spread by taking advantage of a Windows vulnerability that Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) released a security patch for in March. But computers and networks that hadn't updated their systems were still at risk.

In the wake of the attack, Microsoft said it had taken the ""highly unusual step"" of releasing a patch for computers running older operating systems including Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003.

But the patches won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

""Affected machines have six hours to pay up and every few hours the ransom goes up,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, the principal security researcher at security firm Kaspersky Lab. ""Most folks that have paid up appear to have paid the initial $300 in the first few hours.""

On Saturday, experts said it appeared that the ransomware had made just over $20,000, although they expected that number to pop when people went back into the office Monday.

Related: 5 things to know about the attack

WannaCry has already caused massive disruption around the globe.

Sixteen National Health Service organizations in the UK were hit, and some of those hospitals canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible. The NHS said in a statement on Saturday that there was no evidence that patient information had been compromised.

In China, the internet security company Qihoo360 issued a ""red alert"" saying that a large number of colleges and students in the country had been affected by the ransomware, which is also referred to as WannaCrypt. State media reported that digital payment systems at PetroChina gas stations were offline, forcing customers to pay cash.

""Global internet security has reached a moment of emergency,"" Qihoo360 warned.

Major global companies said they also came under attack.

Fedex said Friday it was ""experiencing interference with some of our Windows-based systems caused by malware"" and was trying to fix the problems as quickly as possible. Two big telecom companies, Telefónica (TEF) of Spain and Megafon of Russia, were also hit.

""This is turning into the biggest cybersecurity incident I've ever seen,"" U.K.-based security architect Kevin Beaumont said.

Russia's Interior Ministry released a statement Friday acknowledging a ransomware attack on its computers, adding that less than 1% of computers were affected, and that the virus was now ""localized"" and being destroyed.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in a statement late Friday, encouraged people to update their operating systems. ""We are actively sharing information related to this event and stand ready to lend technical support and assistance as needed to our partners, both in the United States and internationally,"" the department said.

Related: How leaked NSA spy tools created a hacking free-for-all

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, the attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion.

When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.

16,How to protect yourself from the massive ransomware attack,"It's on track to be one of the biggest recorded ransomware attacks ever, with tens of thousands of infected computers in nearly 100 countries.

Friday's attack largely hit businesses and large organizations: UK hospitals, a Spanish telecom, FedEx, the Russian Interior Ministry. But how much do individuals need to worry about their personal computers being targeted?

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that takes over a computer and locks the user out, preventing them from accessing any files until they pay money. This particular program, called WannaCry, asks for about $300, though the price increases over time.

WannaCry takes advantage of a Windows flaw discovered by the NSA and made public by hackers in April. Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) did release a patch for the vulnerability in March. But computers and networks that didn't update their systems were still at risk.

On Friday, a security researcher inadvertently created a ""kill switch"" to help stop the spread of this ransomware. However, a hacker could rewrite the code to omit the kill switch and start trying to infect new machines with a new version of it.

The worm is primarily impacting business, where it can spread quickly through a network to take down an entire company. Business take longer to install critical updates and patches, often to avoid impacting any legacy software they are running.

But individuals with PCs running Windows should still take a few precautions. First, install any software updates immediately and make it a regular habit. Turn on auto-updaters where available (Microsoft offers that option). Microsoft also recommends running its free anti-virus software for Windows.

If you don't already have a backup routine, start now and regularly save copies of all your files. That way if your machine gets infected and your photos and documents are encrypted, you don't need to worry about losing them.

Finally, always stay alert. Don't click on links that you don't recognize, or download files from people you don't know personally.

It's not just your computer that you need to be worried about. This attack has impacted many large services and organizations, including hospitals in England, a telecom and natural gas company in Spain, and FedEx. Basic services that impact your life could be impacted even while your own machines is clean.

16,When should spies tell companies that their systems can be hacked?,"A massive ransomware attack was carried out Friday, hitting hospitals, companies and government offices in nearly 100 countries.

It spread through a vulnerability leaked last month in a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA. The ransomware outbreak has reignited the debate about when spy agencies should disclose these vulnerabilities -- especially when people's lives are at stake.

The NSA and other spy agencies look for software vulnerabilities and then build tools to target and exploit them. Under current laws, they don't have to report the flaws to the company at risk. Instead, they can use them for intelligence gathering or law enforcement.

The leaked hacking tools publicized a Windows vulnerability. Even though Microsoft released a patch in March, computers and networks that hadn't updated their systems were still at risk. The ransomware, called WannaCry, locked down all the files on an infected computer and asked the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them.

Late Friday, Representative Ted Lieu announced he is working on legislation to reform the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, which is how the government decides when to disclose vulnerabilities. Lieu said it is ""deeply disturbing"" the NSA likely wrote the original malware used to ransom computers.

""[Friday's] worldwide ransomware attack shows what can happen when the NSA or CIA write malware instead of disclosing the vulnerability to the software manufacturer,"" Lieu said in a statement.

Microsoft issued a patch one month before it was leaked publicly, but it's unclear when or if the NSA told it about the vulnerability. Lieu says the current disclosure process is not transparent, and often misunderstood.

Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the ACLU, said the ransomware attack raises questions about agencies stockpiling vulnerabilities instead of responsibly disclosing them.

""It's particularly concerning when you're talking about widely-available software, when the impact on the people is going to be the public at large, not the handful of targets an agency might have,"" Singh Guliani told CNNTech.

Some privacy advocates say that if the NSA had disclosed the vulnerability when it was first discovered, the outbreak may have been prevented.

Related: World reels from cyberattack that hit nearly 100 countries

Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who exposed the broad scope of NSA surveillance in 2013, tweeted, ""If @NSAGov had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they *found* it, not when they lost it, this may not have happened.""

However, security researchers say firms that fail to keep their software up-to-date are also responsible for the ransomware outbreak. Organizations had two months to update their Microsoft products, which would have protected their systems.

""You can't force businesses to patch critical Windows vulnerabilities,"" said Adrian Sanabria, founder of security firm Savage Security. ""No matter how this was disclosed or when it was disclosed, some percentage of businesses would not have applied.""

UK hospitals were among the organizations affected by the ransomware outbreak. They were forced to reschedule patients, and people were warned to stay away from emergency rooms if possible.

In 2016, Motherboard reported hospitals across the UK run old, outdated Windows systems -- legacy technology that no longer receives updates. Those facilities are not unique. In the U.S., for instance, the federal government relies on legacy systems, spending $60 billion each year to maintain old technology, while spending just $20 billion on modernization.

Related: How to protect yourself from the massive ransomware attack

Organizations running older Windows software couldn't patch immediately because there was no patch available. However, in an unusual move, Microsoft released updates on Friday for some versions it no longer supports.

Consumers and businesses who have updated to the most recent Microsoft Windows software are protected from WannaCry.

Researchers say we will continue to see this type of ransomware. While this particular ransomware was inadvertently stopped on Friday, hackers could modify the code and try again.

Mark Mager, senior researcher at security firm Endgame, said it's the most prevalent and effective example of ransomware worming through networks around the world.

""Ransomware developers and attackers tend to borrow, copy and steal techniques and software from each other,"" he said. ""Since this WannaCry attack has been so effective thus far, it is quite likely that this is the first of many ransomware attacks that leverage exploits to effectively spread their payloads throughout the Internet.""",cnn
10,Global cyber-attack: Security blogger halts ransomware 'by accident',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero'

A UK security researcher has told the BBC how he ""accidentally"" halted the spread of the malicious ransomware that has affected hundreds of organisations, including the UK's NHS.

The 22-year-old man, known by the pseudonym MalwareTech, had taken a week off work, but decided to investigate the ransomware after hearing about the global cyber-attack.

He managed to bring the spread to a halt when he found what appeared to be a ""kill switch"" in the rogue software's code.

""It was actually partly accidental,"" he told the BBC, after spending the night investigating. ""I have not slept a wink.""

Although his discovery did not repair the damage done by the ransomware, it did stop it spreading to new computers, and he has been hailed an ""accidental hero"".

""I would say that's correct,"" he told the BBC.

Cyber-attack scale 'unprecedented'

NHS 'robust' after cyber-attack

""The attention has been slightly overwhelming. The boss gave me another week off to make up for this train-wreck of a vacation.""

What exactly did he discover?

The researcher first noticed that the malware was trying to contact a specific web address every time it infected a new computer.

But the web address it was trying to contact - a long jumble of letters - had not been registered.

MalwareTech decided to register it, and bought it for $10.69 (£8). Owning it would let him see where computers were accessing it from, and give him an idea of how widespread the ransomware was.

Image copyright MalwareTech Image caption Owning the web address let MalwareTech monitor where infections were happening

By doing so, he unexpectedly triggered part of the ransomware's code that told it to stop spreading.

Analysis: How did it start?

What is the ransomware?

This type of code is known as a ""kill switch"", which some attackers use to halt the spread of their software if things get out of hand.

He tested his discovery and was delighted when he managed to trigger the ransomware on demand.

""Now you probably can't picture a grown man jumping around with the excitement of having just been 'ransomwared', but this was me,"" he said in a blog post.

MalwareTech now thinks the code was originally designed to thwart researchers trying to investigate the ransomware, but it backfired by letting them remotely disable it.

Does this mean the ransomware is defeated?

While the registration of the web address appears to have stopped one strain of the ransomware spreading from device-to-device, it does not repair computers that are already infected.

Security experts have also warned that new variants of the malware that ignore the ""kill switch"" will appear.

""This variant shouldn't be spreading any further, however there'll almost certainly be copycats,"" said security researcher Troy Hunt in a blog post.

MalwareTech warned: ""We have stopped this one, but there will be another one coming and it will not be stoppable by us.

""There's a lot of money in this, there is no reason for them to stop. It's not much effort for them to change the code and start over.""",bbc-news

Pope Francis was greeted by crowds of hundreds of thousands as he made saints of two shepherd children at the Fatima shrine complex in Portugal.

""We declare the blissful Francisco Marto and Jacinta Marto saints,"" the pontiff said to loud applause.

It is 100 years since the two - and a third child - reported seeing the Virgin Mary while tending sheep. The third is also on the way to sainthood.

Portugal boosted security and re-imposed border controls temporarily.

Some 500,000 worshippers gathered in the town of Fatima, north of Lisbon, for the ceremony on Saturday, the Vatican said in a statement.

Roman Catholic pilgrims converged on the Fatima Sanctuary from countries as far away as China, Venezuela and East Timor.

The town's local bishop first read out the request for the two ""little shepherds"" to be canonised before the Pope declared them both saints of the Catholic Church.

Earlier on Saturday, the official Twitter account of the Pope posted a message with reference to the Virgin Mary.

""Whenever we look to Mary, we come to believe once again in the revolutionary nature of love and tenderness,"" it said.

The pontiff also met Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa for a private meeting ahead of the ceremony.

Plea for harmony

On Friday, Pope Francis flew into Fatima in a helicopter and travelled through the town in his ""Popemobile"".

At a candle-lit vigil he called for harmony between all people at the Chapel of the Apparitions and spoke of wars ""tearing our world apart"".

The chapel is built on the very spot where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Devotees took part in the candle-lit procession

Two of the children - Jacinta and Francisco Marto - have been canonised for the miracles attributed to them. They died in the 1918-1919 European influenza pandemic.

The so-called three secrets of Fatima were written down by their cousin, Lucia dos Santos, who died in 2005 aged 97. The beatification process for her began in 2008.

The Church attaches great value to their visions, as Mary is believed to have revealed truths to help mankind. The Church says the first vision came on 13 May 1917.

In a video message to the people of Portugal, the Pope said he was going to present himself to Mary ""and I need to feel you close, physically and spiritually, so that we are one heart and one mind"".

What are the three secrets?

They are prophecies written down by Lucia, years after the apparitions that the three said they had witnessed. She spent her adult life as a nun at a convent in Coimbra.

The first two secrets in Lucia's account were revealed in 1942.

The first described a terrifying vision of hell, with a ""great sea of fire"", demons and human souls

The second is interpreted as Mary's prediction that World War One would end and that World War Two would start during the papacy of Pius XI

Mary also called for the ""consecration"" of Russia, saying: ""If my requests are heeded, Russia will be converted, and there will be peace; if not, she will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church""

Lucia sealed the third secret in an envelope, which was handed to the Vatican in 1957 and only revealed in 2000

It described an angel demanding ""penance!"", then the Pope and other clergy climbing a mountain, only to be killed by soldiers firing bullets and arrows.

What does the Vatican say about them?

According to Pope Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, the visions described in the three secrets are ""meant to mobilise the forces of change in the right direction"".

They are not like the Bible - a text he describes as a ""public revelation"".

The Fatima visions are ""private revelations"", he writes. Their purpose is ""to help live more fully"" in accordance with Christ's teaching.

The late Pope John Paul II was shot by a Turkish gunman on 13 May 1981.

He believed that his survival was due to Mary's divine intervention, and that the third secret had predicted the attack on him.

John Paul donated the bullet to Fatima, and it was inserted into the crown adorning a statue of Mary there.

What about Pope Francis's visit?

He follows John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who also made pilgrimages to the Fatima Sanctuary.

Security was high at the site, with Portugal deploying 6,000 police and emergency workers. Concrete blocks were placed on approach roads, to stop any terrorist ""ramming"" attack with a vehicle.

Only nine border crossings remained open, with systematic checks, as Portugal temporarily suspended the Schengen open borders pact.

Local accommodation over the weekend was far more expensive than usual, as hotels and residents cashed in on the papal visit.",bbc-news
10,Microsoft unveils the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update,"Microsoft has announced that its next big update to Windows 10 will be the Fall Creators Update and it’s coming later this year.

You might be thinking, ‘wait a minute, didn’t the Creators Update just roll out?’ And you’d be right, but Microsoft says their not done making its operating system even better for creative types.

Windows Story Remix

At the center of this upcoming Windows 10 build is a new creative app called Windows Story Remix. Its most interesting aspect is that it allows users to create mixed reality content. Microsoft demoed the app by adding 3D objects to photos and video to help tell stories users can explore.

Otherwise, the new app is essentially about helping users create shareable memories out of their photos and videos by automatically stitching them together. From there, users can add little creative touches like a soundtrack, theme, cinematic transitions (read: star wipes), or even draw and write on them with Windows Ink.

The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will hit many of the best 2-in-1 laptops

Windows Story Remix is also a collaborative app, that allows users to share media. For example multiple parents could all shoot different angles of a soccer game and the app will automatically pull together the footage to create a highlight reel.

With face recognition, users could also tell Windows Story remix to make a certain person the start of the video.

While this app is currently untitled, it seems like it will be an interesting new wrinkle to the Windows 10 experience and feels like a perfect fit for Windows 10 Mobile and its lineup of smartphones – which we have no doubt it will land on eventually.

Image 1 of 3 Windows 10 is getting a big makeover Image 2 of 3 Hello white taskbar Image 3 of 3 Apps get a new look too

Fluent Design System

At the heart of the Fall Creators Update is a new user interface called the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which both changes the look and how you interact with apps. Originally code named Project Neon , Fluent Design will drive more expressive and engaging apps for a wide range of devices.

Secondly, the new design language hopes to tackle input diversity head on. With a modern Windows 10 device, users can interact with touch, ink, voice, gaze and gesture. Simply put, Fluent Design hopes to create a more harmonious and responsive cross-device experience.

Pick up and go

Speaking of cross-device experiences, the Fall Creators Update comes with new features specifically designed for those who flip from one device to the next.

Microsoft introduced Timeline to help users jump back into what they were working on. It works by showing users a visual timeline of their desktop so they can get right back into the files, apps and sites they were accessing at the time. At a basic level, it’s a lot like MacOS’ Time Machine, but for revisiting your desktop state from an earlier time and place.

Beyond your PC, Cortana enables the same Pick Up Where You Left Off across a wider variety of Windows, iOS and Android devices. Microsoft gave the example of being able to work on a doc on the PC and Cortana asking a user whether they would like to finish it up on a phone.

Last but not least, Clipboard brings universal copy and paste to Windows devices and beyond. Aside from just clipping text and web links, Clipboard also allows users to transfer photos and animated GIFs from a Windows PC to their preferred mobile device.",techradar

10,The best cheap Apple Watch deals in May 2017,"Finding cheap Apple Watch deals is a difficult task in 2017 because this is the Apple’s newest product category. Apple Watch price drops remain rare.

Good news: we’re here to help you avoid paying full price for an Apple Watch, and it all depends on where you shop. You also don’t necessarily have to own the brand new Apple Watch 2.

Yes, the Apple Watch 2 is the best Apple Watch you can own. However, the refreshed Apple Watch Series 1 and older original Apple Watch are just as good for certain people.

Here’s a list of the best Apple Watch deals for all four variations of the smartwatch as well as a few places to buy the cheap Apple Watch bands at a discount. Don’t let this accessory add up, either.

Apple Watch 2 deals

Fitness takes over the Apple Watch

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

Water-resistant

GPS onboard

Expensive

Lack of useful apps

Apple Watch 2 is the most expensive iPhone-compatible smartwatch you can own, and for good reason. It includes specs and features not available for the cheaper Apple Watch Series 1. This includes GPS tracking, a brighter screen and waterproof specs that let it operate in a pool. All of that sounds great, until you see the expensive price tag, especially for the Ceramic Apple Watch 2. Aluminum cases make for the cheapest Apple Watch 2, followed by stainless steel and ceramic. There’s no gold model anymore, but more intricate Apple Watch bands do lead to higher prices. In other words, you have to ‘watch out’ and shop smartly when picking out your Apple Watch 2 below.

Not always accurate

The Apple Watch Nike Plus Edition is actually the newest Apple Watch 2, one that’s dressed in sporty colors like neon green along its perforated Sport Band. It’s brilliant looking. Yes, you can now buy the Apple Watch Nike Plus Edition bands separately, but you can't get the exclusive Nike running watch faces. The problem is this smartwatch is just as expensive as the Apple Watch 2 and less likely to see a price drop right away. Apple and Nike, after all, launched it a month after the Watch 2. There are places in which you can find a cheap Apple Watch Nike Plus, and places like Amazon that have third-party retailers jacking up the price on this sought-after Nike Apple Watch. Be careful out there.

Apple Series 1 deals

The best Apple Watch for most non-runners

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S1P dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: splash-proof | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

The best Apple Watch for most people

Faster performance than Apple Watch 1

Lacks Series 2's bright screen

No GPS and not waterproof





The Apple Watch Series 1 is actually the best Apple Watch for most people who aren’t all-star runners and avid swimmers. It has most of the specs you need on a smartwatch. This is a refreshed Apple Watch compared to the original Apple Watch, so it has a faster dual-core processor and better battery life as a result. It runs all the same watchOS 3 software. Best of all, the much cheaper Apple Watch Series 1 price doesn’t leave out a whole lot. If you don’t need to track GPS runs and swim with it on, you’ll save money. The discounted Apple Watch Series 1 still comes in two sizes, 38mm and 42mm, but only has the more economical an aluminum case and Sport band. It’s the best Apple Watch value.

Original Apple Watch deals

The iPhone-tailored smartwatch merely a convenient gadget

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S1 System-in-Package (SiP) | Band sizes: Varies drastically per style | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

Cheapest Apple Watch now

Include heart-rate monitor

Noticeably slower performance

Battery life is one (waking) day

The cheapest Apple Watch on sale today is the original iWatch, the company’s first smartwatch that came out in April 2015. No, the Apple Store doesn’t sell this price-reduced Apple Watch 1 anymore, but there are plenty of retailers still hawking the original Apple Watch at a discount. The best part – besides the cheap Apple Watch 1 price – is the fact that it runs watchOS 3 with all the same apps as an Apple Watch 2. It’s a vast improvement over the launch software.

Apple Watch band/strap deals

Bands are not one-size-fits-all-budgets

Wide variety of sizes, colors and prices

Incredibly easy to slide onto your Watch

Can't use normal watch straps

Official Apple Watch bands are pricey

Your Apple Watch literally isn’t complete without the best deals on Apple Watch bands. They make the geeky smartwatch stylish enough to show off to late adopters.

In fact, you’re going to want multiple cheap Apple Watch straps simply because more elegant bands are far from ideal for the gym. Vice versa, Sport Bands don’t cut it at the fancy dinner table.

Everyday in the news, we see new cheap Apple Watch bands trying to become the de facto alternative to the more expensive, official Apple Watch bands, and they’re usually just as good. Trust us, buying a trio of third-party, lookalike Apple Watch bands for the price of one official strap is a relief after paying so much for the smartwatch itself. Plus, you'll want to save up for the eventually Apple Watch 3.",techradar
10,Google's Project Treble will actually let you experience the latest Android updates,"Google’s new Project Treble is set to speed up the time it takes for your phone to get access to Android O, the upcoming release that’s now confirmed for Summer.



Traditionally, if you buy a phone that’s not made by Google, you run the risk of waiting weeks, months, or even years for it to be updated to the latest and greatest operating system available.



This changes that, or so Google says, with Treble being its “biggest change yet to low-level system architecture.” In a nutshell, Google’s work here is to make it easier for manufacturers to push the new software that you so desire to your phone, cutting down on the time and money requirements that were previously necessary.



Posted in the Android developers blog , the big difference that will help speed things along for your preferred device maker is that Google is pushing for phones released moving forward to feature vendor implementation, part of the greater Android architecture, that won’t need to be updated with each new OS release.



According to the post, it’s the interface that gives developers access to “hardware-specific features of Android.” With these changes in place, manufacturers will have far fewer things to rework with the next major update.

A big step forward?",techradar
10,"Google IO 2017: dates, schedule and rumors for Google's big developer conference","Update: Just days before IO, Google announced Project Treble to speed up the time it takes for phones to receive Android O. The new version of Android, by the way, is also confirmed to release this summer.

Project Treble aims to cut down on the fragmentation that can plague Android releases, when users wait months or even years to get the latest flavor of Android on their devices. It will be easier for manufacturers to push out new software, starting with Android O.

Original article below...

Google IO, the search giant's annual developer conference, is almost here. Actually, let's try that again: Google is calling this year's IO an ""outdoor developer festival"", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and so much more.

The Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif.

The official Google IO 2017 schedule is also out now, letting attendees and those watching from home get a taste of what Google has cooking.

We're still digesting everything Google announced at IO 2016, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat , the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.

This year's event looks to be just as jam-packed, so if you're a developer interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop on over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited in order to register). Attending IO is no cheap trip: General admission Google IO 2017 tickets cost $1,150 (about £930, AU$1,535).

While this ""festival"" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.

Google IO 2017 schedule

Google has announced a ton of talks as part of the Google IO 2017 schedule , and here's some great news if you're unable to attend in person: Every technical session, all 150+ of them, will be livestreamed.

Google is also doing something different this year and hosting an hour-long Developer Keynote at 1pm PT on May 17, shortly after the main keynote wraps up. This will give developers a chance to gain deeper insight into how they can utilize everything Google just announced.

A few sessions to highlight from the current schedule are:

What's New in Android : 2pm - 3pm PT May 17. In what will likely be the most well-attended and widely watched session of IO, What's New in Android will dive into topics such as the Android O Developer Preview SDK, Support Libraries and what Google says will be ""other new and exciting developments."" Expect plenty of details on what Android O will offer both developers and users.

Android Wear: What's New & Best Practices : 9:30am - 10:30am PT on May 18. This session will ""introduce new features of the next release of Android Wear,"" which could be a sign Google will talk about Android Wear 3.0 at the conference.

What's new for Android TV : 10:30am - 11:30am PT on May 18. Here, developers will learn all the latest on the Android TV front, including new APIs, features and future platform improvements.

Introduction to Android Instant Apps : 1:30pm - 2:30pm PT on May 18. In what will likely be a key theme of the show, this session will go over Instant Apps for developers, including how to build them. While this may be a bit too technical for regular users, it's a sign Google will devote plenty of time - and probably officially roll out - Instant Apps at the show. Here's more on why this is a good thing for users .

Google promises more talks are on the way, so we'll keep this page updated with anything that sounds interesting between now and May 17. To get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!

Say hello to Android O

The star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O next week.

While we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another public submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.

What will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case with Android O.

But what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.

One of the most exciting features in the early build is 'Background limits'. This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.

Android O also currently houses picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.

Google also announced Project Treble in the days before IO, which will help users get the latest flavor of Android more quickly. In a nutshell, Google's work here is to make it easier for manufacturers to push new software that you want desire to your phone, cutting down on the time and money requirements that were previously necessary.

One final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth to your devices.

As Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, also look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.

What's the word on Android Wear 2?

Android Wear 2 launched in February, so while it's unlikely Google will announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.

For starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.

We wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2 apps are announced, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.

With Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.

ZTE Quartz review: The latest Android Wear 2 smartwatch

Google Home invasion

Google introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write ""Google"" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features made available to the original.

One of the more robust rumors is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.

Considering Google already has the Project Fi and Google Voice services, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which puts the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.

Another report, this time from early April , says Google is considering an updated Home smart speaker that doubles as a mesh Wi-Fi router.

The device would act as a personal assistant and internet router in one, and presumably like Google Wifi would need multiple units to create a mesh network.

A few points against updated hardware or major new features are that Google Home added one of its most requested features, multiple user support , in mid-April and the device just went on sale in the UK. Still, if Google is working to improve Google Home, chances are we'll see whatever is in store at IO.

Google Chrome improvement

Another area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and this could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.

The most likely developments we'll hear about are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.

There are also whispers spreading Google is preparing an ad-blocker built into Chrome. It's almost impossible ad revenue-dependent Google would block every ad on Chrome, so it's more likely Google will introduce a tool that filters out the most offending ads. Perhaps we'll meet this quasi-ad blocker at IO.

New Google Pixel phones? Perhaps

Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL are in the works.

It's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.

Not only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, and if a recent Google investment in LG Display is anything to go by, the new Pixel phones will have curved OLED screens.

Virtual reality, Chromecast and everything else

There's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we might see:

Like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2 headset, but we'll undoubtedly have news on the VR front from the Big G. These could include a headset price reduction, or updates related to how developers create and publish content for virtual reality.

With Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , as Google recently told us, we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.

On the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 . This would certainly make sense, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the IO cards.

Another possible topic are updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.

We could also be in for a new Chromecast as it's been some months since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale. At one time the best selling streaming video device, Google may look to recapture some of that old Chromecast magic with a new and improved device.

Google is also interested in getting Assistant into more devices. The search giant released a developer preview Google Assistant SDK in late April, letting anyone build the digital helper into any device they create. While many of these gadgets will be of the prototype variety, expect some commercial products to hit the market with Assistant in tow. We'll likely hear plenty more about this initiative during IO.

The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.

Google recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.

This is not to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January. And with video app Google Duo adding voice-only calling on April 10, the chat app waters have gotten even muddier.

(Image: © Google)

What is clear is that there are one too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps the Big G will finally drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.

This was in an effort to ""focus and prioritize"" on the features and apps Google deems most important, and could be just the start of a chat service spring cleaning we'll see the culmination of at IO.

Another likely announcement is the Allo desktop and/or web app, both of which have been teased by Google execs. Users are especially keen to get Allo on the desktop, and it's a good bet Google won't want to disappoint.",techradar
10,Tesla's new moonshot is solar energy — here's why it might just work,"Tesla is a powerhouse in the modern tech world, and for good reason. The company's push for electric cars has captivated consumers, investors and industry observers, and the result is that Tesla is now the most valuable American car company . CEO Elon Musk has even set his sights on overtaking Apple one day in terms of company worth.

More recently, Tesla's focus has broadened, and it's made a different kind of push, one that aims to capture energy from the sun and use it to power people's homes.

The move makes sense. Tesla isn't just a car manufacturer; it's a multi-pronged company aiming for unseen heights in renewable energy. Tesla wants to radically transform how we access and use energy in our everyday lives, and to that end it's spearheading two different products: solar panels and solar roof tiles, also known as the Tesla Solar Roof.

Tesla's solar products are remarkably different than what we're used to seeing. Not only are the designs sleeker than traditional solar panels, but Tesla claims they are also cheaper, and that's before the savings you can expect on your power bill.

There are, of course, plenty of questions. How does Tesla plan to implement this new wave of solar power products? Is its technology really cheaper and more effective than traditional solar panels? Can Tesla pull off completely transforming home energy consumption, forever?

Tesla and solar energy: a brief history

Tesla's mission in solar and beyond is clear: the company wants to re-imagine how we consume energy. You might not know, however, that this plan actually isn't new.

In the 'Secret Tesla Motors Plan (just between you and me),' a blog post written in 2006, Musk described his grand vision to transform Tesla into more than a car company.

""...the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution,"" wrote Musk.

Tesla started laying the groundwork for that transformation long before it announced any solar panel. Critical to using green energy is the ability to store it, and Tesla came up with a way to do just that in the Powerwall. First announced in 2015, the Tesla Powerwall serves as a battery to store energy captured by solar panels and tiles.

Tesla Powerwall battery

The Powerwall stores energy collected from a solar roof or tiles, and even from the electric grid. The stored energy can be used to power a home when there's no sunlight, or when the cost of electricity is higher, such as during the early evening hours.

While the original Powerwall came at a cost of $3,000 or more, the new and improved Powerwall 2 starts at $5,500, largely because it includes a built-in power inverter.

This means the unit will convert captured energy from the sun into energy that can actually be used in your home. Previously, you would had to buy an inverter separately.

With its Powerwall in place, Tesla took an even bigger step in becoming a solar power powerhouse in August 2016 when it purchased SolarCity for $2.6 billion. Founded by Elon Musk's cousin, Lyndon Rive, SolarCity specializes in the installation and development of solar panels. The SolarCity acquisition was a huge deal for Tesla; with SolarCity under its wing, Tesla can deploy full solar systems, complete with solar roofs, batteries, and so on.

Catching rays

Part of the appeal of Tesla's solar solutions are how aesthetically appealing they are: they are sleek, modern-looking, and blend in seamlessly. Tesla proved energy efficiency doesn't have to come at the cost of curb appeal with the Model S and Model X, and it's doing so again with its solar tech.

It's important to reiterate that Tesla has two solar products right now: its more traditional solar panels and the Solar Roof, which looks like standard (yet beautiful) roof shingles, but serve as both roofing and solar panels.

But looks will only take you so far, and Tesla has made its solar solutions functional, too.

The technology used in its tiles is a new form of solar technology, and thus a bit of a change for Tesla.

When Tesla first launched the Model S, it did so using a slew of existing technologies and battery cells built by Panasonic. With its solar tiles, Tesla has tapped a new technology built by Silevo, a company that was acquired by SolarCity for $200 million in 2014. That technology, however, is still somewhat new, and it's unproven in large-scale manufacturing, according to a report from The Buffalo News . So, while the technology works in the lab, it's still unclear if it can be as efficient on a larger scale.

Look just like shingles, right?

The tiles essentially incorporate different layers — a layer of glass on the top, then layers of various films, then solar cells, which convert light into electricity. Silevo technology uses what's called a ""heterojunction cell,"" and while the details of the technology get technical, the point is this: Silevo tech could offer an efficiency of up to 22%, which is greater than averages of between 10% and 15% more traditional panels achieve.

There are still a few things that are a unclear about Tesla's tiles at this point, however. Tesla is expected to use both Silevo and Panasonic technology in its solar products, but these will need to prove they can work considering Silevo is still considered somewhat experimental.

It also appears as though Tesla has taken a step back from Silevo because of its partnership with Panasonic as well, but that doesn't mean it's ditching the tech altogether. Instead, it's likely the technology just needs some more development to be effective on a mass scale.

Tesla's solar panels

Meanwhile, Tesla's solar panels, announced in April 2017, are different than the solar tiles. They look more like traditional panels, albeit sleeker. This is thanks to a much lower profile than other solar panel offerings, making them not as immediately noticeable.

According to Tesla, the panels ""exceed industry standards for durability and lifespan."" The panels aren't actually built by Tesla, but rather by Panasonic, which are then re-sold by Tesla. These don't use the Silevo technology found in the tiles.

'Plug it in and use it'

In addition to a pleasing design, experts argue the intelligence of Tesla's software combined with its Powerwall home batteries will be the real draw to home owners.

Tesla has revealed little about the software behind Powerwall, but on the consumer level it can monitor energy usage in real-time and features intelligence that allows it to automatically adjust its settings according to your usage needs and daily routine. While you don't necessarily need a Powerwall, it helps Tesla solar users get the most out of their panels or tiles.

""Tesla is using existing off-the-shelf battery technology [lithium ion] but bundles its very tech-smart information systems design to make storage just as easy as solar,"" Daniel Kammen, Professor of Energy at the University of California, Berkeley, tells TechRadar. In other words, solar energy is already easy, and Tesla makes storing it just as simple.

""Plug it in and use it,"" Kammen said.

This end-to-end package isn't something other solar companies seem to have mastered: they don't use solar to its full potential, and all the energy captured during the day can't be used at night without a decent battery. With Powerwall, Tesla is delivering a holistic solution to consumers.

Real solar savings?

While solar energy in general saves money on electric bills, it's still expensive to install, so you may not feel like you've saved money for quite some time if you go Tesla's route. Still, the company argues that eventually you will see worthwhile savings on energy use.

According to Tesla, the real savings are to be found in its Solar Roof. And we’re not just talking the cost of the tiles compared to other solar products: Musk said during an earnings call in November that installing its roof is cheaper than installing standard roof tiles. And that's before the money you save from the energy it generates.

""Electricity,"" Musk said, ""is just a bonus.""

Electricity is just a bonus Tesla CEO Elon Musk

But is this claim of cheaper costs true? Well, it's complicated. According to Musk, the solar tiles are cheaper than the cost of concrete or ceramic roof tiles. Those, however, are among the more expensive roof tiles out there, running between $400 and $2,000 per 100 square feet, according to The Motley Fool .

So while Tesla's roofing may end up being cheaper than some traditional materials, it will only be cheaper than the more expensive traditional materials.

Tesla unveiled pricing for its Solar Roof earlier this week, so we can helpfully run the numbers. On average, a Solar Roof will cost $21.85 per square foot for a 3,000-square-foot roof, although that pricing depends on factors like location and the ratio of solar to non-solar tiles you purchase.

Here's what you'll see when Tesla spits out your Solar Roof estimate

Because pricing varies home-to-home, Tesla launched an online calculator to figure out price estimates.

For this story, we plugged in a 3,000-foot-square roof in Sunnyvale, California, and received a roof installation estimate of $79,500, plus $7,000 for the Tesla Powerwall. Undoubtedly that's a lot of money, but for the materials used and the type of roof you're getting, it's actually around the same price as a non-solar roof.

According to Consumer Reports , a traditional Slate Tile roof would cost around $98,500 to install on a 3,000-foot-square roof, making it more expensive than the $79,500 Textured or Smooth Glass roof we calculated for our fictional Sunnyvale home.

What's more, you start saving after the initial install. In California, you would get a $21,000 tax credit for installing such a roof, and Tesla says the roof would generate $113,900 of energy over the next 30 years. At the end of the 30 years, you will have paid off your roof, and generated an extra $48,400 worth of energy. In the long run, your solar roof would cost zero dollars, and you could even make money from it by selling the extra energy.

An important part of Tesla's equation is the ratio of solar tiles to non-solar tiles. Tesla's roofing is actually built from a combination of solar and non-solar tiles, and you can adjust the ratio you want installed. Using fewer solar tiles and more non-solar tiles will result in a cheaper installation cost, but less energy generated.

Tesla's solar tiles are, at least on paper, worth it the investment, even if you weren't thinking of getting a more expensive slate glass roof. Traditional roofing simply can't generate money, and will only cost you in repairs and replacements. Even cheaper asphalt tile roofing, which costs around $20,000 to install on a 3,000-foot-square roof, will cost you more money over time.

And what about the more traditional Panasonic-made solar panels Tesla recently unveiled? Are they more affordable and cost effective than other panels? Unfortunately, we can’t know yet as Tesla hasn't announced pricing for its panels.

We can do a bit of sleuthing, however. Solar Power Authority , which offers quotes for panels, says the average cost of solar panels is around $5-$6 per watt including installation. That puts a 5kW system between $25,000 and $30,000.

Tesla’s Panasonic modules each offer 325 watts, so each module should sit between $1,625 and $1,950. They likely won’t be sold by individual modules, but any less than that would be considered a good price to pay.

Tesla solar takes flight

Tesla is still working on its solar products, and in fact only two of its four solar tile options are available this year, with the others arriving in 2018. The two up for pre-order now are Textured Glass and Smooth Glass, and next year will see Slate Glass and Tuscan Glass.

Tesla's venture into solar may still be in the early stages, but already it's poised to be an influential player in the renewable energy world, helped by unique products, a respected business model and name recognition.

""Tesla has both a fantastic technology solution that is available right now, and a great brand and market research,"" said UC Berkeley's Kammen. ""This is a powerful combination.""

The big question now is whether home owners actually buy a Tesla Solar Roof or panels. Residential solar is on the rise in the US, but while 2016 was the market's biggest year to date, the number of residential solar installations in the country still only totals somewhere above one million, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The climb to widespread residential solar adoption is steep, but with Tesla joining the fray, more homeowners may now consider switching to solar, whether for the installation price, long-term savings, to be an early adopter, or all of the above.

What is clear is Tesla is serious about solar, and we expect to learn about improvements in the technology, cheaper pricing and even more energy products in the months and years to come.",techradar
16,NBC reverses itself and renews Save Our Shows favorite 'Timeless',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The creators shared the shocking news on Twitter. Time

Celebration time: Abigail Spencer, Malcolm Barrett and the rest of the 'Timeless' gang are coming back to NBC after all. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA T)

Apparently, fan voices do count.

In an unusual move, NBC reversed itself Saturday, renewing freshman drama Timeless for a second season. The network had canceled the time-travel adventure series earlier in the week.

The pickup is for 10 episodes, fewer than a traditional renewal order. In a celebratory tweet, co-creator Eric Kripke said Timeless would be back in the summer of 2018, but no return date has been set.

MORE: Check the renewal status of every show

Fans made Timeless the top choice for renewal in USA TODAY's annual Save Our Shows poll, with 49% of participants in a record 146,000-vote turnout wanting to bring it back. It topped 23 other series considered ""on the bubble"" between renewal and cancellation in the poll.

Devotees made their voices heard elsewhere, too, starting an online #RenewTimeless campaign. As of Saturday, a new hashtag was born: #TimelessResuscitated.

In Timeless, Abigail Spencer, Matt Lanter and Malcolm Barrett play characters traveling to different eras in time. In the first season, their assignment was to stop a villain (Goran Visjnic) from changing history.

""The mission was successful,"" Lanter breathlessly told fans in a Facebook Live video Saturday. ""We went back and I'm pretty sure we changed NBC's minds.""

Timeless, which average 8 million viewers per episode, had 16 episodes in its first season, fewer than the 22 that is the general broadcast standard. The last original episode ran in February.

Timeless producers, who also fiercely advocated for the show, celebrated the surprise reversal on Twitter.

Co-creator Shawn Ryan, not the only one to make a time-travel joke, said, ""NBC went back in time and changed history.""

It's true! NBC heard from the fans, went back in time and changed history! #Timeless is getting a Season 2! #TimelessResuscitated! — Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyanTV) May 13, 2017

Kripke made a similar joke, then thanked NBC and fans in a follow-up tweet.

The #TimeTeam went back 3 days, and changed history. @nbc picked us up for 10 episodes. Seriously. Airs next summer. #TimelessRenewedpic.twitter.com/SDkeShlByL — Eric Kripke (@therealKripke) May 13, 2017

6,Ex-Justice Department officials call for independent counsel in Russia probe,"Former FBI Director James Comey (Photo: Cliff Owen, AP)

A bipartisan group of 179 former federal prosecutors is calling on the Justice Department to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, following President Trump's abrupt firing this week of James Comey as FBI director.

In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the former prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York called Comey a ""highly professional and ethical person."" They said his firing has ""the appearance — if not the reality — of interfering"" with the FBI's ongoing probe into whether Trump's campaign associates colluded with Russians to sway election results.

""Even if this investigation continues unabated, there is a substantial risk that the American people will not have confidence in its results, no matter who is appointed to succeed him, given that the director of the FBI serves at the pleasure of the president,"" the group wrote.

The former prosecutors who signed the letter include Benito Romano, the district's interim U.S. Attorney during President George H.W. Bush's administration; Robert Cleary, who served as U.S. Attorney in New Jersey after working in the New York office; and Richard Ben-Veniste, who was a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal and later served as a member of the bipartisan commission that investigated the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Comey himself spent nearly two years as the U.S. Attorney in the New York-based district before his promotion to deputy attorney general during President George W. Bush's administration. President Obama appointed Comey to a 10-year term as FBI director in 2013.

Earlier this week, Democratic Attorneys General from 19 states and the District of Columbia also called on Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel.

The power to appoint an independent counsel falls to Rosenstein because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the Russian investigation. USA TODAY reported Friday that Rosenstein has indicated he's not yet inclined to appoint a special prosecutor. He is slated to brief senators on the Comey firing next week, according to a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

Trump has denied any collusion between his camp and Russian interests ahead of last November's election and has denounced the investigation as a ""witch hunt.""

3,Egyptian archaeologists uncover necropolis with 17 mummies,"Egyptian Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany, center, speaks to the media on May 13, 2017, in front of mummies following their discovery in catacombs in the Touna el-Gabal district of the Minya province, in central Egypt. (Photo: Khaled Desouki, AFP/Getty Images)

MINYA, Egypt — An Egyptian archaeological mission has found a necropolis holding at least 17 mummies near the Nile Valley city of Minya, in the first such find in the area, the antiquities ministry said Saturday.

The discovery was made in the village of Tuna al-Gabal, a vast archaeological site on the edge of the western desert. The area hosts a large necropolis for thousands of mummified ibis and baboon birds as well as other animals. It also includes tombs and a funerary building.

“It’s the first human necropolis to be found here in Tuna al-Gabal,” Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani told reporters at the site, 135 miles south of Cairo. The mummies were elaborately preserved therefore likely belong to officials and priests, he said.

The new discovery also includes six sarcophagi, two clay coffins, two papyri written in demotic script as well as a number of vessels, he said.

The necropolis, which is eight yards below ground level, dates back to the Late Period of Ancient Egypt and the Greco-Roman period, the minister noted.

Pointing to the edges of the necropolis where legs and feet of other mummies could be seen, the minister said that the find “will be much bigger,” as work is currently in only a preliminary stage.

The discovery comes as Egypt struggles to revive its tourism sector, partially driven by antiquities sightseeing, which was hit hard by political turmoil since the 2011 uprising.

The president urged the school's graduating seniors to never give up, regardless of the adversity. (May 13) AP

Capping a week of turmoil over his firing of FBI Director James Comey, President Trump told a crowd of college graduates Saturday they should not be afraid to challenge the establishment or government elites who would second-guess whatever they do.

""Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the same courage,"" Trump said at a commencement speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va.

In an implied blast at his critics, Trump told the Liberty graduates that ""Washington is run by a small group with failed values who think they know everything — we don’t need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives.""

Trump did not specifically mention Comey or other political disputes that have marked his first four months in office, but made repeated general references to his maverick campaign and presidency.

Read more:

At one point, Trump said, ""in my short time in Washington, I've seen first-hand how the system is broken."" At another, he told students and parents at the conservative religious school that ""nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic.""

Trump also praised the military for its battle against the Islamic State and referred at one point to his recent executive order on religious freedom.

Speaking at school that bills itself as the world's largest Christian university, Trump made repeated references to God and the role of faith in society. ""We don’t worship Washington,"" he said. ""We worship God.”

The president also engaged in more traditional commencement rhetoric, congratulating the graduates on their accomplishments and lauding the school's academic credentials and football program. Trump praised the Liberty evangelical community for its political activism, and cited the large support of religious conservatives for his campaign.

""What will you give back to this country and indeed to the world?"" Trump asked the graduates.

Earlier, during the Air Force One ride to southwestern Virginia, Trump told reporters that ""we can make a fast decision"" on a new FBI director, possibly before his departure Friday on a trip to the Middle East and Europe. Trump said he and his staff are looking at ""very well known, highly respected, really talented people, and that's what we want for the FBI.""

Among the names under consideration to be interviewed Saturday, according to a source familiar with the process who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations: Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, former Justice Department Criminal Division Chief Alice Fisher and New York state judge and former U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia.

The search takes place amid an ongoing firestorm over Trump's dismissal of Comey and new questions over whether he taped conversations with the now-former FBI director.

In a Friday tweet, Trump said Comey ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Since that comment, neither Trump nor his aides would confirm or deny questions about whether he in fact tapes conversations.

""I won't talk about that,"" Trump told Fox News in an interview. ""All I want is for Comey to be honest and I hope he will be and I'm sure he will be, I hope.""

Trump, angry over media coverage on the Comey issue, has also threatened to end White House news briefings.

Democrats, and some FBI officials, charge Trump got rid of Comey in order to impede an investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia, which tried to influence the 2016 election by hacking prominent Democrats.

In a commencement address of her own, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, told University of Massachusetts-Amherst graduates they should fight for “the principle that no one, no one in this country is above the law and we need a Justice Department, not an obstruction of justice department.”

Trump has denounced the Russian investigation as a ""hoax"" and ""witch hunt.""

During the commencement address at Liberty's football stadium, Trump lauded students and parents for being ""Champions for Christ."" Saying that ""there may very well be a president or two in our midst,"" Trump encouraged young people to get involved in public life and persevere in the face of criticism.

""A small group of failed voices, who think they know everything, and understand everyone, want to tell everybody else how to live and what to do and how to think,"" Trump said. ""But you aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you are right.""

A fired-up Michelle Obama is defending the nutrition programs she advanced as first lady, saying something is ""wrong"" when the government doesn't want kids to eat healthy meals.

In a speech Friday to the Partnerships for a Healthier America conference, Obama did not mention Trump by name but took issue with changes his administration announced last week to ease some of the school nutrition standards she advanced.

""We gotta make sure we don't let anybody take us back,"" the former first lady said. ""You have to stop and think, why don't you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you? And why is that a partisan issue?""

""Take me out of the equation — like me or don't like me,"" she added. ""But think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap. Why would you celebrate that? Why would you sit idly and be okay with that? Because here's the secret: If somebody is doing that, they don't care about your kid.""

The comments marked the first time Obama has weighed in on the Trump administration's changes to the nutrition policies she helped champion.

On May 1, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the changes, which ease rules on whole grains required in school lunch meals and delay a requirement for further reductions in sodium.

Perdue said the changes were needed to give local programs more flexibility to provide meals that children want to eat.

""If kids aren't eating the food, and it's ending up in the trash, they aren't getting any nutrition,"" he said in a statement announcing the rollbacks.

9,"Bryce Harper, Nationals reach unusual contract deal","Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper is scheduled to become a free agent after the 2018 season. (Photo: Mitch Stringer, USA TODAY Sports)

In an unusual midseason agreement, the Washington Nationals and Bryce Harper came to terms on a one-year contract extension that gives both club and player cost certainty ahead of Harper’s expected free agency after the 2018 season.

The Nationals announced Saturday that they’d reached agreement on a 2018 contract for Harper, with FanRag Sports reporting that it was worth $21.65 million, a record for an arbitration-eligible player. It also includes a reported $1 million bonus should Harper win the 2018 MVP award.

MORE MLB COVERAGE:

While multiyear deals that take arbitration-eligible players to the doorstep of free agency are common – such as Lorenzo Cain’s two-year, $17.5 million deal with Kansas City that expires after this season – an in-season agreement for a player’s forthcoming sixth season are rare. But the Nationals offered Harper a salary number that likely would have exceeded what he would have received via arbitration after 2017.

While it may be just as it appears – a bit of early winter housekeeping – the agreement does indicate a degree of good faith on both sides’ parts. The Nationals could have let Harper play out the season and slot his 2018 salary accordingly.

With Harper off to a fine start – he’s batting .372 with an NL-best .496 on-base percentage, 10 home runs and a 1.213 OPS – the Nationals likely foresaw a significant raise coming, anyway.

And by settling this matter now, it at least shows both sides are talking as Harper approaches a 2018 winter in which he should shatter Alex Rodriguez’s record 10-year, $275 million pact for a free agent.

The Nationals will have significant competition to retain Harper’s services after 2018 – and may have already determined he’ll be too pricey, anyway. But at the least, they have ensured the air will be clear until then – and the club can make a run at a World Series this year and next with the 24-year-old superstar in the fold.",usa-today

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE — Pope Francis says he won’t try to convince President Trump to soften his policies on immigration and the environment when they meet this month, but wants instead to find common ground and work for peace.

Francis said proselytizing isn’t his style — in politics or religion.

Speaking to reporters while traveling home Saturday from Portugal, Francis said he would say what he thinks sincerely to Trump and listen respectfully to what Trump has to say.

“I never make a judgment about a person without hearing him out,” the pope said.

Speculation has swirled about what Trump and Francis will discuss during their May 24 audience, given that Francis has already said anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is “not Christian.”

Trump, who made building a wall along the border with Mexico a signature campaign promise, responded by saying it was “disgraceful” that the pope would question his faith.

Read more:

Francis said that in talks, he always tries to find “doors that are at least a little bit open” where common ground can be found, particularly in peace-building.

“Peace is artisanal. You do it every day,” he said.

Asked specifically if he would try to soften Trump’s policies, Francis said: “That is a political calculation that I don’t allow myself to make. Also in the religious sphere: I don’t proselytize.”

Trump will call on Francis mid-way through his first foreign trip, after visiting Saudi Arabia and Israel and before attending a NATO summit in Brussels and a G-7 summit in Italy.

Boos and shouts of ""Liar!"" nearly drowned out her address to students graduating from Bethune-Cookman University. (May 10) AP

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Silencing people with differing opinions has become a pattern on college campuses.

The most recent instance was at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, where Betsy DeVos faced a barrage of non-stop boos during her commencement speech Wednesday. During the Education Secretary's entire 20-minute speech and any time her name was mentioned, the audience heckled her, some screaming ""get the [expletive] out"" and ""shut the [expletive] up."" Angered by her past remarks that historically black schools are the ""real pioneers when it comes to school choice,"" graduates turned their backs to the stage and raised their fists to the ceiling.

""Let’s choose to hear one another out,” DeVos said in a failed attempt to persuade the crowd. “I am here to demonstrate in the most direct way possible that I and the administration are fully committed to your success and to the success of every student across this great country.”

University President Edison Jackson interrupted DeVos at one point and threatened to mail the graduates their degrees if they didn't stop. DeVos sympathizers scolded the students for showing disrespect.

But experts say that was the whole point.

""The whole purpose of protest is to be rude,"" said Pamela Oliver, professor of sociology at University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""It's not like they hadn’t warned the college that they (the students) were upset about it.""

Campus mobs muzzle free speech: Our view

While Oliver considered the protest pretty tame — ""its noisy, but it's not the black bloc, they're not out breaking windows or throwing blocks"" — that isn't always the case.

Protesters at Middlebury College in Vermont vandalized a car and injured a professor when Charles Murray, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist, came to speak in March. Protests against Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos' visit to University of California-Davis ended with one man shot.

At schools across the nation, students have jeered commencement speakers and college visitors they don't agree with — in some cases, blocking them from campus completely.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos gave a speech at Bethune-Cookman University's commencement ceremony. As she spoke, many in the crowd voiced their disapproval. USA TODAY

Students argue that they are just exercising their freedom of speech. But experts say, sometimes the protests go too far, tiptoeing the line between free speech and civil disobedience, which can be punishable by law.

""People get confused. Of course it's not free speech to stop speech,"" said James Weinstein, a professor of constitutional law at Arizona State University. ""Now, that might be civil disobedience. If some neo-Nazi was coming to campus to advocate for the re-enslavement of blacks and extermination of Jews, and you wanted to stop that — is that a matter of civil disobedience? We could have that discussion, but it's certainly not free speech.""

Quashing events with controversial speakers, as was the case at the University of California-Berkeley where conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of a speaking engagement in April, also hampers productive conversations, he added. If we don't listen to each other, Weinstein warned, things are only going to get worse in an already divided time in history.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The choice of DeVos sparked immediate backlash last week among many students and alumni of the Florida university, who signed a petition asking the school to rescind her invitation Time

""I think there's a line between legitimate protest and shutting down an event,"" said Weinstein. ""It isn’t proper for them to try and stop the presentation of ideas that they find offensive or evil, and it certainly isn't promoting free speech.

""It's no more free speech to stop an event than to throw a smoke bomb in the place.""

Harold Pollack, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, agreed there's a fine line between protesting and preventing speakers from being heard.

“If they invited a Holocaust denier to the University of Chicago, I would turn my back on that person, boo them, but I wouldn’t prevent them from speaking,” Pollack said. “From a strategic point of view, the stupidest thing you can do is elevate these figures. The focus is on the misbehavior of those protesting, rather than the low quality of the ideas [the speaker] has to offer in public debate.""

Read more:

Do controversial figures have a right to speak at public universities?

Milo Yiannopoulous' speech at UC-Berkeley canceled as protest turns violent

Even speakers who spew what some consider hate speech have the right to speak, argued Weinstein.

Truman State University in Missouri came under fire in April for inviting Robert Spencer, who runs the conservative website ""Jihad Watch"" and has been classified as a an extremist and anti-Muslim propagandist. It was the same story at Texas A&M when Richard Spencer, who's considered one of the founders of the alt-right movement and a white supremacist, spoke on campus.

""In this country, that kind of speech is legal. We have no hate speech exception in the first amendment,"" said Weinstein. ""Even stopping the most virulent Nazi on campus isn’t free speech; it is civil disobedience.""

But simply booing speakers, as was the case at Bethune-Cookman — although students and alumni did petition school administration to dis-invite her — is usually well within the rights of protesting.

Bethune-Cookman alumnus and current vice president of the American Federation of Teachers Fedrick Ingram, who protested DeVos' visit, was proud of his fellow B-CU Wildcats.

""In the spirit of Mary McLeod Bethune (the school's founder and civil rights activist), I wouldn't expect anything less,"" said Ingram after the ceremony. ""We should never squelch a collective voice of people trying to do the right thing.""

The NAACP has since called for the firing of President Jackson and Chairman of the Board Joe Petrock, who said they hoped the event could be a teachable moment, for inviting DeVos in the first place.

College students have a long history of protesting commencement speakers they don't agree with. Dating back to the 80s, students have challenged the likes of Sen. Rick Santorum, First Lady Barbara Bush, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie, Sen. John McCain, Vice President Dick Cheney and President Barack Obama.

New legislation could change that. In Illinois, Tennessee, Colorado and Arizona, a bill that would prevent colleges and universities from dis-inviting speakers and force them penalize students who obstruct such events is picking up steam.

""Loudly booing, being rude to people, signs with obnoxious pictures or caricatures of Trump or people you disagree with is a long tradition of American protest,” said Pollack.

It helped me tell stories about my family, where it was important to understand the view I had from my bedroom, or that there was a dividing half-wall between the kitchen and the living room in an otherwise open concept house. I’d draw lines to illustrate the trajectory of our tiny dog, who’d ricochet against the fridge, scramble down the hallway, bank off the doorframe into my parents’ bedroom, and steal a pair of socks. If I adjusted the scale of my drawing, I could show how close the house was to a nearby conservation area, and to the river beside where I’d sneak cigarettes and spray myself with CK One perfume before returning home, as though my mother wasn’t wise to the fact that the wooded areas of Guelph don’t smell like department store fragrance. My parents sold that house last fall, and moved into my mother’s childhood home — Nonna’s house, to me. Nonna is still alive, but her dementia means she’s been relocated to a retirement community, leaving her house empty. It wasn’t an easy process: My parents, looking to downsize, hadn’t found anything suitable after two years of looking. And Nonna, fiercely independent and living alone since the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier, wasn’t ready to let the house leave the family. She might not have ever moved were it not for the dementia, which, as a byproduct of its gradual erasure of Nonna’s memory, had made it dangerous for her to live alone. Once my parents bought the house, they began the physically necessary but emotionally taxing work of making it their own: a full reno, new appliances, new furniture. In addition to Nonna herself, most of the stuff that reminded me of her — the baby-blue shag carpet, the just-for-show purple towels in the upstairs bathroom, the Jesus portrait hanging above the staircase — is gone too. Nonna, for most of my life, would spend hours in conversation with me — in person at her house in Guelph, then over the phone once I moved to Toronto. Last time I saw her, she remembered me as her “granddaughter,” and that took 30 minutes. Nonna is physically recognizable to me, but the version of her who exists in my mind — the woman who anchored my family down — now lives only in the objects I connected to my formative memories of her: The kitchenwares, framed photographs, and textiles that were split among her living family members after my parents bought the house. They were once just home furnishings, but are now a direct line to a person in the midst of being erased. When I think of my parents’ new house, I draw the floor plan to Nonna’s house in my head. Then I fill it with all her physical belongings, the ones that still remind me of her, the ones I couldn’t save and that I’ll never see again. Even though Nonna is still alive, I include her.

When architects go on digs, the artifacts they uncover serve as irrefutable scientific evidence of the past. But they’re also objects that connect us to this past on a more visceral, sentimental level than carbon-dating. Physical artifacts can, to the trained eye, go well beyond confirming the existence of history — these objects tell us about habits, customs, fears, superstitions, victories celebrated and losses mourned; they tell us that people existed, and they tell us who those people were.

When my mother’s family moved to Canada from Northern Italy in 1959, they were stuff-less by necessity because there was no home ready for such things. The four of them — my mother, her older sister, and my Nonna and Nonno — first rented part of a house in a predominantly Italian neighbourhood in Guelph, later renting a whole house, all the while saving money for the plot of land they would eventually buy not far away by slowly buying only the stuff they needed: A matching pink couch, loveseat and chair, and a tufted, brocade couch for the basement; a television with knobs you’d twist to change the channels; a solid-wood kitchen table, so massive and imposing I always imagined they lowered it in with a crane before the house had a roof. After her husband died in 1984 — and, I think, even before — Nonna didn't replace things often, if ever, giving the impression that everything I ever knew Nonna to own was all she had ever owned.; Iin my mind she and her furniture, her pots and pans, her plates and cooking tools, are all inextricable from her. iThey were always in the same place (and, consequently, talways in the same place as her),and always in the same condition. Nonna and her things were constants, and while the stuff wasn't expensive or elaborate, but it was hers. She favoured olds sets of dishes for weeknight dinners of meaty pasta or perfect fried chicken cutlets with garlicky, parsley-studded mushrooms, and ancient tupperware for food storage. When things broke a little, she kept using them; when they broke a lot, she would fix them. There was a system to the way things were cared for: No plate or glass ever hit the kitchen table without a coaster or placemat beneath. Nonna cared about her home and possessions not because they were expensive, but because she bought them with her own money, and kept them in good shape. Her independence reflected in the purchase, the care, and the maintenance of a set of powder-pink living room furniture that may well have been brand new if not for their sort of awful late-60s hue. The way Nonna viewed her home and her things reflected how she viewed herself (and vice versa): With meticulous grooming, diligent upkeep, and the ability to either work around breaks as they happened, or fix them on her own. She cared for herself like a person who had the potential for permanence. There came a point when things began to degrade beyond her capacity for repair and upkeep. At first, this had to do mainly with Nonna’s physical limitations. It was difficult for her to descend the stairs to vacuum the basement, for example, so the rec room became permanently sealed off. Soon, my family was beginning to pitch in with laundry and small household chores. Without Nonna’s diligence, the house began to show its age. The plates, pans and utensils in her cupboards collected dust as they fell into disuse — she’d still cook sometimes, sure, but she didn’t have the energy for family dinners anymore. And sometimes, the recipes tasted just a bit off, like she’d forgotten a step, or confused the measurements for a couple of ingredients. She became anxious, distracted, and confused. But despite the physical evidence collecting around her — the house and everything in it, spotless and new for decades, was suddenly old and worn — Nonna denied there was anything wrong. Four years ago, she left a pot of water on the stove so long it was blackened beyond the point of cleaning or repair. She had completely forgotten it was there. In any other context, the incident might have been innocuous, but for Nonna — who had already been slowly losing grip on her stuff, her home, her independence — it was a tipping point. lLiving alone was no longer safe. My family began discussions about moving her to a retirement home, which involved discussions about what would come of her house, and of course, all her things. Near the end of Nonna’s time at the house, that kitchen table — around which we’d gather every Christmas, and at least on Sunday a month — began to crack right down the middle. The springs on the basement couch had become so worn, you’d almost hit the floor if you sat on it. And and who wanted a television that forced you to walk up to it just to change the channel? As anyone who’s divided an estate will tell you, the conversation around a loved one's possessions revolves largely around one question: What do you want? Some things were readily spoken for — the only two pots that remained of the set shipped over from Italy went to my mother and aunt. An espresso set, long coveted by one of my cousins, was set aside for him. The basement furniture, all of it worn by time or by the misuse of my sister and I, was donated or trashed. Last Easter, my sister and I sat down in my aunt’s basement to divide the possessions that had been set aside for us — mostly things from the kitchen. What was initially a conversation of utility, of looking at objects and determining, as I always do when deciding what I should own, whether they’re of actual use to me, became an exercise in remembering Nonna through her possessions. Things became impossible to discard. When presented with the physical manifestation of every Sunday dinner I’d ever eaten, invisibly imprinted with the memory of the woman who cooked them as I watched over her shoulder. I couldn’t imagine living without any of it. I took broken Tupperware that might have once carried leftover lasagna from Nonna’s house to ours, and a full set of cutlery despite already owning more than enough forks. I took a giant gilded soup tureen that I had never even seen before, because I knew it was part of a set that had been carefully carried over on a boat, in 1959, and an awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot whose only use, as far as I can tell, is boiling water. I wrapped it all up in a set of rags—threadbare after years of use dusting the framed photos of Nonno, which, along with some wedding gifts and pieces of jewellery, were the only sentimental things I knew Nonna to own—that are now vacuum sealed and packed away, to preserve Nonna’s crisp hemmed edges, never again to be used for their intended purpose. In Nonna’s things, I can still see her the way I remember her best: Proudly self-sufficient and independent. And if I keep her things clean, in good working order and in good repair, I feel like I can keep that Nonna — the one she herself fought to maintain, the one she tried for so long to deny we were all losing, the one who, in reality, disappeared many years ago — alive forever.

The last time I talked to Nonna on the phone, it was on her 87th birthday. She told me that she was very old now, that she hadn’t really felt up to doing anything that day. She asked if I was happy with my job and my apartment. Then she thanked me for calling and said goodbye. No “I love you.” Until four or five years ago, Nonna would repeat her “I love yous” at the end of a phone call until I had no choice but to hang up on her. I don’t doubt that she still loves me; it’s more likely that these days, after a few minutes, she doesn’t remember who called.

When I was younger, I took for granted what an indomitable force Nonna was. She lived alone and kept a home by herself for three decades, while acting as an emergency contact for my entire family, no matter what we needed: A ride, a loan, a night off. She could be difficult and demanding, but we were close. I was patient with her when she struggled with English, and, later, eager to learn from her when she cooked. When she still lived at home but had begun to experience waking nightmares, I spent a night there, and she felt safe enough to sleep through the night. In my adult life, I have used Nonna’s immovable spirit of independence as a guiding principle. Now, her loss of independence is devastating because it means I have lost the part of her of which I was most in awe, but also, because I am terrified of someday losing my own. The same things that happened to Nonna will probably happen to me, with or without dementia. I might not be able to wash the plates I took from her kitchen to mine, because they’re too heavy. My eyesight might prevent me from patching up small holes in t-shirts and dish cloths, and my back — which is already in bad shape, frankly — could make it hard for me to vacuum my carpets. I might forget how to cook the things I most love to eat. I will get old, and I will fight back against age as it claws back against my ability to do things for myself. And I, like Nonna, might refuse to negotiate and to accept that I simply can’t do things the way I used to. Frankly, I probably will: I’ve adopted a lot of Nonna’s obstinate self-sufficiency. I wonder if I’ll forget her awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot on the stove someday, and I wonder who will decide what happens to all of the things I’ve inherited from Nonna after I’ve forgotten that most of them ever existed in the first place. When I first saw how my parents had changed Nonna’s house, was like one of those dreams where you know you’re at your old high school but everything looks like your best friend’s kitchen. The cognitive disconnect was overwhelming. On an early visit, I ran my hand along one of the hallway walls, wondering if I’d be able to physically register that it now ends sooner than it used to. I’d close my eyes while sitting on the new, grey couch and pretend I was still sitting on the old, pink one; a feat of imagination assisted by a living room window that’s still the same width and height that it used to be. Though, with horizontal blinds replacing the old vertical ones — and slightly less light coming in — it feels like everything has gotten a bit colder, and a bit smaller. The truth is actually kind of the opposite: Nonna’s furniture took up so much more space than the stuff my parents own. Especially the table. And somehow, they lifted the massive wood one that hosted all the Christmas dinners, coffees, and conversations we never had anywhere else, and moved it out of the house. Nobody saved it. The crack down its middle had deepened into a chasm; the solid foundation that had once supported our family gatherings was being gradually replaced by a widening, empty gulf, unyielding as it was irreparable.",buzzfeed

9,Dana White explains why Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather has to be a boxing match | FOX Sports,"There’s a lot of chatter these days about some of the biggest stars from the UFC testing themselves against their counterparts in the sport of boxing.

Of course the biggest matchup that spurred on this conversation is the rumored bout between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather as the UFC lightweight champion looks to go after boxing’s retired pound-for-pound king.

From the start of the rumors about the proposed super fight, it was always meant to be a boxing match, which favors Mayweather, who is arguably one of the all time greats in that particular sport.

While McGregor may be a massive underdog to Maywaether in the ring, UFC president Dana White says the odds would be insurmountable in a mixed martial arts contest and that’s why he hasn’t heard any boxers calling out his fighters to meet inside the Octagon.

“You notice none of them are clamoring for that one. I like that one a lot better. Any of the big boxers that want to come over here and want to fight our guys, I’m in,” White teased when asked by no boxers have been offering to try out MMA. “Mayweather-McGregor would be over in 15 seconds.”

White has already played out that hypothetical scenario previously when he welcomed multi-time boxing champion James Toney to the Octagon where he faced Hall of Famer Randy Couture in 2010.

The fight lasted less than four minutes.

Obviously, White doesn’t expect any boxers to really want to test the waters in mixed martial arts, but he’s also putting down his foot on any of the fighters in the UFC stepping into the squared circle as well.

White will do everything in his power to put together the fight between McGregor and Mayweather, but that’s where his interest in becoming a boxing promoter comes to an end.

“The biggest one out there is Conor vs. Mayweather. That obviously makes a lot of sense,” White said. “Both guys are huge stars and they both want this fight.

“So most of these other ones make no sense.”",fox-sports

Harper, 25, was the 2012 NL Rookie of the Year and the unanimous 2015 NL MVP, and his pending free agency following the 2018 season already has created speculation about a bidding war – and a potential $400 million mega-contract.

The deal announced Saturday covers only the final season that Harper is under the Nationals’ control, but it does provide a glimpse into the multiyear contract he could ultimately land – in Washington or elsewhere. Harper is making $13.625 million this season.

After a down year in 2016, Harper is slashing .372/.496/.717 with nine doubles, 10 homers, 37 runs and 29 RBI this season.

Lloyd’s goal came after teammate Lucy Bronze scored the opener, followed by Izzy Christiansen knocking in the second. Charlie Wellings scored for Birmingham after the break to offer a faint heartbeat, but City’s Jill Scott pulled the plug in the 80th minute.

Scoring at Wembley has become a habit for Lloyd, who scored both of the USWNT’s goals in a 2-1 win in the 2012 Olympic final victory against Japan at the historic venue. With the FA Cup title, Manchester City secured the treble in England after winning the Women’s Super League and the Continental Tyres Cup.

9,USWNT starlet Mallory Pugh turns down offers from abroad to play in NWSL for the Washington Spirit | FOX Sports,"Mallory Pugh has signed with U.S. Soccer to play in the NWSL and she will suit up for the Washington Spirit. The deal is a coup for the league, which made signing the 19-year-old starlet a priority as soon as she announced she was foregoing college soccer to turn pro.

Pugh already has 22 caps for the United States and became the youngest American to ever score at an Olympics when she found the back of the net at the 2016 Games. She’s been a fixture with the U.S. ever since and there was talk she would skip college more than a year ago. However, she originally decided to enroll at UCLA, attending classes in the winter, but changed her mind last month and dropped out to play professionally.

No young American has more hype than Pugh, who drew interest not just from NWSL, but also teams abroad. Olympique Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain were reportedly interested in signing her, making the competition for her signature stiff. And while Pugh appeared most interested in staying in the U.S., multiple reports indicated that she didn’t want to play for the Washington Spirit, who had the top pick in the league’s distribution order.

The Spirit have had a rocky existence, with constant roster turnover and controversial ownership. It’s not exactly surprising that Pugh reportedly preferred to play elsewhere, especially when MLS-backed clubs like the Portland Thorns and Houston Dash could provide top-notch facilities and support.

However, U.S. Soccer, which pays the salaries of national teamers in NWSL, and the league were intent on keeping the brightest young American in the American league. U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati even got involved in the negotiations despite being in Bahrain for the FIFA Congress, according to the Washington Post.

With seemingly everyone involved in American women’s soccer working to ensure Pugh would play in NWSL, and with the Spirit, a deal got done. Pugh has a contract and will suit up for the Spirit.

Pugh’s contract with U.S. Soccer, which covers both her national team and Spirit commitments, is almost certainly relatively lucrative, but she will also cash in with endorsement money. She is already speaking with Nike and adidas over a footwear and apparel deal and will add other endorsements.

There are huge expectations for Pugh, which would be daunting for most 19-year-olds. But to this point, Pugh has handled everything thrown her way and shined on the field. Now she’ll try to do the same for the Washington Spirit.",fox-sports

9,Kasper Schmeichel rips referees after Man City's vital win vs. Leicester | FOX Sports,"Kasper Schmeichel was not a happy man following Leicester City’s controversial loss to Manchester City on Saturday. The Foxes’ goalkeeper questioned referee Bobby Madley and his officiating crew’s decision-making and consistency following the 2-1 loss at the Etihad.

City’s first goal in the 29th minute came after Leroy Sane’s cutback pass into the box found David Silva, who slotted it to Schmeichel’s far post. Teammate Raheem Sterling, who was offside, swung a leg at it but didn’t touch it and the goal was allowed to stand. That’s where Schmeichel first took issue with the officiating after the match, via SkySports.

“The first goal is offside. Anybody who has played football, especially in goal, will know it’s offside. If he’s in the six-yard box and the ball is going by him, past my line of sight, that means he’s interfering. It doesn’t even matter if he goes for it, he’s interfering because I can’t see the ball. “Fuchs can’t get to the ball because he’s stood in the way of him and prevents him from swinging his foot at the ball. Then he swings his foot at the ball, so he’s made an attempt. So three times he’s offside. It’s one of these very frustrating decisions because we’d done well up until then and we kind of lost our composure for five or 10 minutes and they got the second one.”

The Foxes also had a late penalty disallowed, as Riyad Mahrez slipped during the attempt and sent a shot that deflected off his plant foot into the Manchester City net. Madley saw the double-touch and rightly disallowed the goal, but Schmeichel bemoaned the lack of consistency among referees. The Danish keeper cited Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann’s penalty against Real Madrid in the Champions League semifinals, where a double touch also took place but wasn’t noticed.

“Griezmann did it in the semi-final and it stood, so you talk about consistency,” he told SkySports. That penalty would have equalized the match in the 77th minute, but Madley waved it off.

The result doesn’t mean much for Leicester on the whole, but it’s a massive result for Man City and the other Premier League teams in the hunt for a top-four spot. A full three points put the Citizens in third place with 72 points, two above Liverpool in the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot. It increased the distance between City and Arsenal, too, who entered the day on 66 points prior to their match against Stoke.

Schmeichel’s comments will likely fall on deaf ears, as referees and officials rarely comment after matches, but he can rest assured that plenty of people are on his side — Man City’s rivals chief among them.",fox-sports
9,Gareth Bale still hasn't returned to training as injury could keep him out from trophy chases | FOX Sports,"Gareth Bale still isn’t training with the team, Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane revealed on Saturday. The update comes as the Merengues get ready for what Zidane has called “four finals” in pursuit of La Liga and Champions League crowns.

“We have to see day to day with Gareth Bale,” he told reporters at a news conference. “He is continuing in the gym, working, trying to get rid of his discomfort.

“It’s getting better, but you have to go day by day. But he’s not even training with us. I cannot tell you when he will return, but hopefully it is soon.”

Bale hurt his calf in Real Madrid’s Champions League quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich. The injury wasn’t called season-ending at the time, but it’s looking like it could be now.

Real Madrid have three La Liga matches in the next two weeks, and if they win all three then they will win the league crown. Then on June 3, the Merengues have the Champions League final, where they will attempt to be the first team to win the tournament in consecutive seasons.

That timeline leaves Bale three weeks to get healthy enough to play. That’s not very long for a player who still can’t train with the rest of the team, and now it’s starting to look possible that he doesn’t see the field again this season. That would mean Real Madrid playing their “four finals” without him as they chase two trophies.

9,Watch Barcelona's Gerard Pique star in new Shakira music video | FOX Sports,"Shakira dropped the video for her new single, “Me Enamore,” on Friday and she spends much of the video frolicking and going on adventures with some mystery man throughout — until a big reveal at the end. Ah, the suspense.

Who could this mystery man possibly be? Her partner, Barcelona centerback Gerard Pique, of course. If you can forgive us for spoiling the shocking surprise twist at the end of the video (sarcasm), you can watch it here:

Why wouldn’t the Barcelona star appear in a Shakira music video? After all, they met on the video shoot for Shakira’s song “Waka Waka (This Time For Africa),” the official song of the 2010 World Cup.

But Pique doesn’t exactly get to show off very many acting chops in this new music video, so for now, we recommend he stick with soccer. Right now that’s with Barcelona, who are in the thick of a La Liga title race, but he has said he would be willing to play somewhere else before he retires, like Shakira’s homeland of Colombia or even in the United States. We’ll have to wait and see.

16,The hero who accidentally stopped the cyberattack from spreading,"An anonymous malware researcher inadvertently helped stop the spread of a global cyberattack that targeted nearly 100 countries.

The 22-year-old researcher, who goes by the name MalwareTech, has become an internet hero for their efforts to stem the spread of the WannaCry ransomware. MalwareTech, who is based in the U.K., did not disclose their identity or gender to CNN. MalwareTech published a blog post early Saturday morning detailing how they stopped the spread of this ransomware.

The ransomware took control of computers around the world and required owners to pay hundreds of dollars to get their files back. It took advantage of a Windows vulnerability leaked in April and the hacking tool is believed to belong to the NSA.

MalwareTech found an unregistered domain name in the ransomware and bought it for $10.69. Then, they pointed the domain to a sinkhole, or a server that collects and analyzes malware traffic. What they didn't realize was that the domain -- a random assortment of letters -- was actually a kill switch, a way for someone to take control of the ransomware.

While the researcher is being lauded online for helping to prevent a more widespread outbreak, MalwareTech doesn't consider themselves a hero.

""I just [think] don't that what I did was that significant,"" MalwareTech told CNN in an email. ""And as of now I've had a fair bit of thanks from different people which is really appreciated, but no job offers which is nice as I'm happy where I am.""

Related: World reels from massive cyberattack that hit nearly 100 countries

""We found out that the domain was supposed to be unregistered and the malware was counting on this, thus by registering it we inadvertently stopped any subsequent infections,"" they told CNN.

However, this only stops one version of WannaCry. There are different versions of the ransomware that do not contact that particular domain and can still spread, so it is possible for computers to get infected. Windows machines that are up-to-date are safe from this ransomware.

6,Trump urges grads to draw lessons from his outsider status,"Story highlights ""You aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe,"" he said

Trump appeared in good spirits at the end of a tumultuous week

Washington (CNN) In his first commencement speech as president, Donald Trump encouraged graduating seniors at Liberty University to draw lessons from his example as a political outsider, telling them to embrace being criticized at the end of a week during which he very much was.

Speaking before what the Christian university estimated were 50,000 graduates, Trump cast criticisms of his actions as a sign that he was doing honorable work in remarks that touched upon religion but were not particularly imbued with religious overtones.

""You aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you're right,"" the President told the crowd, to intermittent applause. ""We don't need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives.""

Trump appeared in good spirits at the end of a tumultuous week in which he fired FBI Director James Comey, leaving his close aides and surrogates to try to deal with the political fallout. In lengthy remarks, he ribbed the school's president, Jerry Falwell Jr., and at one point offered game-by-game commentary on Liberty's upcoming football season, their first in a more competitive college conference, the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Football Bowl Subdivision of independent schools.

""We love setting records,"" Trump said at the beginning of his remarks as he took in the crowd. ""We always set records. We have to set records. We have no choice.""

16,Oprah tells grads secrets to her success,"Oprah Winfrey is one of the most successful people on the planet, and she just gave a group of college graduates a peek at her playbook.

Speaking at the Agnes Scott College commencement ceremony in Georgia on Saturday, Winfrey told the crowd that being ""full of herself"" propelled her career.

""I used to be afraid of that,"" she said. Winfrey added that people have criticized her for being ""full of herself,"" but now, Winfrey said she responds with: ""Yesss, I am. So full.""

Winfrey described ""full"" as being confident and self-aware -- and she said there's only one way to get there: ""You will get nowhere without a spiritual practice.""

""[That's] not necessarily religion. ... Maybe it's music, or dancing or just time for yourself to feed and nurture your own spirit,"" Winfrey explained.

Winfrey also talked about the importance of helping others.

She doesn't talk about her wildly lucrative ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" like a business venture. Rather, she emphasizes how she constantly viewed it as a form of service.

""We were the No. 1 show for 25 years, and that's because I lived with the intention of serving the audience,"" Winfrey said.

The goal, she explained, was to deliver compelling content that ""helped people better understand themselves.""

She said she conducted more than 37,000 interviews over 25 years on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" -- and they drew people in because she did more than just listen to people.

""I had to learn to feel with others, which is what it means to be compassionate,"" she said. ""I feel with you. It means not only am I able to walk in your shoes, my heart beats with yours. I see myself in you.""

Sometimes, she said, her approach went too far: ""I could feel what they were feeling so strongly sometimes it made me sick. Literally.""

And when things aren't going great, Winfrey advises, ""get still"" and do some introspection.

""You move forward by taking the next right step,"" she said. ""If you have to ask other people, you don't [have] the answer yet.""

Lastly, Winfrey told the crowd not to get hung up on material objects.

""The biggest reward is not financial benefits -- though it's really good, you can get a lot of great shoes. Nothing wrong with great shoes,"" she joked. ""But those of you who have a lot of shoes know that having great shoes -- and a closet full of shoes, or cars, or houses or square footage -- doesn't fill up your life.

9,Why Spurs can keep Warriors from another NBA Finals,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick breaks down the Western Conference finals match-up fans have been waiting for: Warriors vs. Spurs. USA TODAY Sports

Why even play the Western Conference finals?

The Golden State Warriors are destined to meet the Cleveland Cavaliers for a third consecutive time in the NBA Finals, right? They’re so dominant, so dangerous and so deep that the San Antonio Spurs ought to just stay home rather than lace ‘em up at Oracle Arena for Game 1 on Sunday afternoon.

Except for one thing: These are the cyborg Spurs.

Long before Kawhi Leonard came along, there was a long line of Spurs greats who always had what it took to win. No matter the opponent. No matter the odds. Their culture, their system and their coach was that great — is that great.

This series is no different. And nobody knows that better than these Warriors.

MORE NBA COVERAGE:

Steve Kerr may not be on the sidelines at the moment, but you’d better believe the ailing Warriors head coach who won two titles as a player with Gregg Popovich’s Spurs is sending this message to his players. His stand-in, former Spurs assistant Mike Brown, can offer an even more recent reminder of the danger posed by San Antonio. He spent much of last season working with Popovich and his staff before getting the call from Kerr last summer to come join the Warriors.

There’s this, too: Despite all the Warriors’ success, the 207-39 regular season record since 2014 and the consecutive Finals appearances and the one championship, they haven’t had to go through the Spurs in the playoffs during that time. San Antonio fell in the first round to the Clippers in 2015, then lost to Oklahoma City in the second round a year ago.

All of which is to say the Warriors had better be careful here. And here’s why.

The Pop factor

Popovich would have the coaching edge no matter who he’s facing. As Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey put it just days before his squad was eliminated in the Western Conference semifinals, the Spurs are “arguably the best coached team ever.”

But the uniqueness of the Warriors’ coaching situation makes this matchup even more interesting. Brown knows Popovich’s playbook as well as anyone, and he has the wealth of head coaching experience gleaned from his time with LeBron James' Cavs and with the Los Angeles Lakers that led to his 9-6 record in postseason series.

And even though the Warriors don't know if Kerr will return in these playoffs as he recovers from the latest round of complications from his back surgery two summers ago, they have another thing going for them.

They are super smart.

This veteran group knows what to run and how to run it even when Kerr is on the sidelines. And Brown, by all accounts, has done a masterful job of fitting in rather than feeling compelled to put his stamp on the operation. And why not? There’s no shame in using the cruise control function if the road isn’t too bumpy.

Yet from Popovich on down, the Spurs are as smart as they come too. They somehow had the league’s top-rated defense (100.9 points allowed per 100 possessions; just ahead of the second-place Warriors) despite giving heavy minutes to players such as Tony Parker (whose season was ended with a quadriceps tendon tear in the last round), Manu Ginobili, LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol who have never been considered strong individual defenders. They somehow beat the Rockets in Game 6 (and at the end of Game 5) despite their MVP candidate, Leonard, being sidelined with a left ankle injury. (He will play Sunday.) They somehow find a way to get the job done, or at least come close.

A big-time problem

In the Warriors’ dream world, their flock of wingmen run the Spurs big men off the floor and force Popovich to go with his small lineups that simply can’t keep up. But the Rockets series was a cautionary tale, a reminder that Popovich’s stubbornness usually pays off.

He swapped David Lee for Gasol in the starting lineup in Game 2, pairing him with Aldridge down low and forcing the Rockets into the kinds of mismatches that eventually wore them down. On one end, James Harden had to guard much bigger men because the Rockets stayed small. On the other, the length prevailed: Gasol (7-foot height; 7-4 wingspan) and Aldridge (6-11; 7-4 ¾) put a lid on the rim and relied on the Spurs’ long wing defenders to cover the shooters.

The Spurs’ length was key on the perimeter, too, with players such as Leonard (6-7 height; 7-3 wingspan), Danny Green (6-6; 6-10) Jonathon Simmons (6-6; 6-7 ½) and DeJounte Murray (6-foot-5, 6-9½) closing and contesting in the kind of way that limited the long-range damage. The Warriors have plenty of perimeter length of their own, but size down low is another matter for the team that spends most of its time with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala running the floor.

Center Zaza Pachulia (6-11) is starting, but he’s averaging just 14.1 minutes in the playoffs. Backup center JaVale McGee (7-foot) has been an X-factor of sorts because of his athleticism and ability to finish at the rim, and even boasts a team-high net rating of 37.3 in these playoffs, but he’s only averaging 11.4 postseason minutes per game. Veteran forward David West, who spent last season with San Antonio before signing with the Warriors last summer, could be called on even more (14.6 minutes per game thus far) if this becomes a battle of the bruisers.

The Spurs’ lone win against the Warriors this season, a 129-100 season-opening rout at Oracle Arena that marked the only time they faced Golden State with Durant, was the kind of formula they’d love to repeat, with 61 combined points for Leonard and Aldridge, a 55-35 rebounding edge and the Warriors hitting just seven of 33 three-pointers.

Will switches get stitches?

If NBA defenses were X-Men characters, the Warriors are Mystique. Minus the blue skin.

This is the special power earned when you build a roster full of long and athletic players, a gritty group with a chameleon quality that combats pick-and-rolls by switching defenders almost every time.

But even Mystique finds herself in a tough spot every so often, and that possibility is there in this series for the Warriors too. Popovich and his staff will be searching for switches that put the Warriors in a bind, like Leonard in the mid-post with anyone who doesn’t size up or Curry or Thompson being stuck down low against Gasol or Aldridge. Work the clock. Swing the ball. Find the weakness.

Popovich will try to find a way.",usa-today

Harper, 25, was the 2012 NL Rookie of the Year and the unanimous 2015 NL MVP, and his pending free agency following the 2018 season already has created speculation about a bidding war – and a potential $400 million mega-contract.

The deal announced Saturday covers only the final season that Harper is under the Nationals’ control, but it does provide a glimpse into the multiyear contract he could ultimately land – in Washington or elsewhere. Harper is making $13.625 million this season.

After a down year in 2016, Harper is slashing .372/.496/.717 with nine doubles, 10 homers, 37 runs and 29 RBI this season.

US President Donald Trump says he could announce a replacement for fired FBI Director James Comey by late next week.

He told reporters it was ""possible"" he could name someone by Friday, before he leaves for his first foreign trip.

Defence lawyer Alice Fisher was the first candidate interviewed at the justice department, US media report.

Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and a few others are also expected to meet Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein on Saturday.

But about 11 people in all are reportedly being considered for the position, which requires confirmation in the Senate.

President Trump has faced a backlash for sacking Mr Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the US election.

He told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he wanted to move quickly to find a new FBI director.

""I think the process is going to move quickly because almost all of them are very well-known, they've been vetted over their lifetime essentially,"" he said.

Fox News quoted a government source as saying they were moving ""quickly and expeditiously"" to find a replacement, adding: ""We're doing our due diligence - we are not going to cut any corners.""

One of those being interviewed is Republican Senator John Cornyn, the second highest-ranking member of the Senate and a former Texas Attorney General.

Mr McCabe was the FBI's deputy director until he stepped up after the abrupt departure of his boss. He appeared to contradict the White House this week when he described the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election as ""a highly significant investigation"".

He also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of FBI staff.

Ms Fisher was an assistant attorney general for the justice department's criminal division. She currently works at a law firm.

The other candidate widely named in the US press is New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia, a former New York prosecutor.

Although reports initially said just those four candidates were on Saturday's interview list, the Associated Press now says that Adam Lee, the head of the FBI's office in Richmond, Virginia, turned up at the justice department as a candidate.

Meanwhile, President Trump is facing growing questions about whether he secretly recorded his conversations with Mr Comey after he appeared to tweet a thinly veiled threat to the former FBI director.

He said Mr Comey ""better hope there are no tapes"" of their conversations at a private White House dinner in January during which the president claims Mr Comey assured him he was not being investigated over alleged links to Russia.

In an interview with Fox News, Mr Trump said that he did not want to discuss the matter and that all he wanted was for Mr Comey to be honest.

He previously told NBC News that Mr Comey had requested the one-on-one dinner, but the former FBI director reportedly maintains it was the president who invited him.

Mr Comey had said he was ""uneasy"" before the dinner, according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

On Friday, the White House denied reports that President Trump had also asked Mr Comey to pledge loyalty to him, and that he responded he would offer the president honesty, but not loyalty.

Mr Trump travelled on Saturday to Virginia to speak at Liberty University, an evangelical Christian institution founded by the late conservative televangelist Jerry Falwell.

The US president enjoys an approval rating from white evangelical protestants that is nearly double his approval rating with the general public, according to the Pew Research Center.

He did not mention the controversy around Mr Comey in his speech to graduates, though he did exhort students to challenge the establishment and ""relish the opportunity to be an outsider"".

Echoes of Watergate

Mr Trump's behaviour in recent days regarding Mr Comey has provoked fresh comparisons between his administration and that of disgraced President Richard Nixon, who famously recorded conversations, speeding his downfall during the Watergate scandal.

Senior Democrats on the House judiciary and oversight committees wrote to the White House on Friday demanding copies of any recordings.

John Conyers and Elijah Cummings' letter noted ""it is a crime to intimidate or threaten any potential witness with the intent to influence, delay or prevent their official testimony"".

The actress returns to Studio 8H this weekend to play both host and her beloved ""Spicy"" on the NBC variety series. Saturday's episode should grab attention as well as big ratings for ""SNL"" and that's because while Baldwin and McKinnon have defined this season, McCarthy's Spicer is its most unexpected star.

""It's been a true blessing for SNL when Alec stepped up to the plate, hitting all his home runs as Trump. But Melissa's impersonation of Spicer has to be the most delicious surprise of this season,"" James Andrew Miller, author of ""Live From New York: The Complete, Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live,"" told CNN.

McCarthy came on as both a figurative and literal comedic hurricane in February when she first introduced her gum-chewing, Super Soaker wielding, run-you-down-with-a-lectern White House Press Secretary.

Not only did no one see her impression as Spicer coming, but much like Baldwin and Trump, McCarthy has been incredibly successful at using satire to affect reality.

""With one performance, Sean Spicer no longer controls how people perceive him,"" wrote Vulture's Jesse David Fox in February. ""The impersonation will likely supersede the real person, like Dana Carvey's George H.W. Bush or Chevy Chase's deeply inaccurate yet effective Gerald Ford. Every time Spicer flubs a word or shouts at the press, people will smile in acknowledgment of the impression. Melissa McCarthy owns him in a way that only the best impressions can.""

And despite Spicer finding himself amused by the ""funny,"" if not over the top impersonation, the depiction was reportedly so damaging that it upset Spicer's boss.

Related: Sean Spicer under fire during crucial week for Trump

Politico reported in February that McCarthy's spoof rattled the White House, with sources saying that Trump found it problematic that Spicer was being mocked by a woman.

Now, McCarthy returns to her ""SNL"" lectern at a time when Spicer appears to be at a low point in his short press secretary tenure.

Spicer was reportedly ""benched"" during a crucial week for the White House in the wake of Trump's shocking firing of FBI chief James Comey. This has led to reports that Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders could be replacing him.

For Spicer, it also doesn't help that stories had him and his staff cloaked in darkness behind a hedge on the White House lawn the night Comey was fired.

Juicy tidbits like these give fodder to ""SNL"" writers while building excitement around the show.

""SNL"" and McCarthy have also been doing their part in building buzz for Saturday night's broadcast all week.

Related: Welcome to CNN, 'Sean Spicer'

This includes promos that features the actress transforming herself into Spicer to the tune of ""I Feel Pretty"" from ""West Side Story."" McCarthy was seen on Friday hitting streets of New York right outside the CNN offices in what appears to be a taping for Saturday's episode.

""If McCarthy goes full Spicer tomorrow night, we'll get further insight into whether the president thinks it's a positive for his spokesperson to be such a big blip on the cultural radar, or whether he's had enough of his chief spokesperson being portrayed like this,"" Miller said.

It is a considerable improvement for the UK, after last year's entrants Joe and Jake came 24th with 62 points. Lucie got the best win since 2011, when boyband Blue got 100 points.

Sobral, who has a serious heart condition that saw him miss the first week of rehearsals, reprised his song at the end of the show and was joined by his sister Luisa for a duet.

Their song, which translates as For the Both of Us, won top marks from both from the televoters and the countries' professional juries, getting a massive 758 points altogether. This dwarfs Jamala's win last year for Ukraine with 534 points.

3,North Korea carries out new ballistic missile test,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption North Korea paraded its military hardware in Pyongyang last month

North Korea has fired a ballistic missile from a region near its west coast, the South Korean military say.

The missile was launched near Kusong, north-west of the capital, Pyongyang, and flew 700km (430 miles), it said.

North Korea has carried out a series of missile tests this year, causing international condemnation and increasing tensions with the US.

Two missile launches last month both failed, with the rockets exploding just minutes into flight.

South Korea and Japan both condemned the latest launch. The South's new President Moon Jae-in convened an emergency meeting of his security council to discuss the issue, Yonhap news agency reported.

Japan said the missile flew for about 30 minutes before landing in the Sea of Japan.

The US Pacific Command said in a statement that the type of missile was being assessed but that its flight was not consistent with that of an intercontinental ballistic missile [ICBM], which would have the range to reach the US mainland.

North Korea is believed to be developing two types of ICBM, but neither has so far been flight tested.

Cuban echoes, by the BBC's Korea correspondent Stephen Evans

The North Korean situation has been likened to the Cuban missile crisis in slow motion.

In October 1962, aerial pictures showed that the Soviet Union was building a missile base on Cuba, just off the coast of Florida.

President Kennedy said he would not accept that. It was what would now be called a ""red line"". In the face of a credible threat of war, the Soviet leader Khrushchev backed down.

It is not clear where Mr Trump's red line is or whether he could enforce it short of a truly devastating war, possibly with China drawn in.

He has said that North Korean missiles capable of hitting the US mainland ""won't happen"". Recently, he has mentioned talking to Kim Jong-un but also warned that North Korea risks a ""major, major conflict"".

There is also a new president in Seoul keen on dialogue. As the missile tests continue, it is not clear when or if Washington would decide on military action - or whether Seoul would try to block it.

The North has conducted five nuclear tests despite UN sanctions and is also developing long-range missiles.

It is reported to be continuing efforts to miniaturise nuclear warheads and fit them on missiles capable of reaching the US.

Washington has accused other UN Security Council members of not fully enforcing existing sanctions against the North, and has urged China in particular to use its trade links as influence.

But despite poor relations, North Korea recently said it would hold talks with the US ""if the conditions were right"".

The comments, by a senior North Korean diplomat, came after US President Donald Trump said he would be ""honoured"" to meet the North's leader, Kim Jong-un.

The latest launch comes days after President Moon was sworn in.

In his first speech as president he vowed to address relations with the North, also saying that he would be willing to visit Pyongyang under the right circumstances.",bbc-news

North Korea on Sunday test-launched a ballistic missile that flew about 435 miles, South Korea's military said, a possible response to the election four days ago of a new South Korean president and as U.S., Japanese and European militaries gather for war games in the Pacific.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the early morning launch but had few other details, including what type of ballistic missile was fired. A statement said that the missile was fired from near Kusong City, in North Phyongan province, and that the South Korean and U.S. militaries are analyzing the details.

Outsiders will be especially interested in what kind of projectile was fired. While North Korea regularly tests shorter-range missiles, it is also working to master the technology needed to field nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland.

Last week South Koreans elected a new president, Moon Jae-in, who favors a much softer approach than his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, who is in jail awaiting a corruption trial.

North Korea needs tests to perfect its missile program, but it also is thought to stage its launches after the elections of new U.S. and South Korean presidents in an attempt to gauge a new administration's reaction.

Moon called an emergency national security meeting Sunday, but he didn't immediately make any statement on the launch.

North Korea's past long-range satellite launches have been called clandestine tests of ICBM technology, but it is not believed to have tested a true intercontinental ballistic missile yet. The Trump administration has called North Korean ballistic and nuclear efforts unacceptable and has swung between threats of military action and offers to talk as it formulates a policy.

The launch also comes as troops from the U.S., Japan and two European nations gather on remote U.S. islands in the Pacific for drills that are partly a message to North Korea.

The launch comes the same day a senior North Korean diplomat who handles relations with the United States said Pyongyang would hold talks with Washington under the ""right conditions,"" according to Yonhap.

Choe Son-hui, director-general of the North America affairs bureau of the North Korean foreign ministry, told reporters at the Beijing Capital International Airport that North Korea ""will hold dialogue under right conditions"" with the new U.S. administration.

The two countries have not held formal, face-to-face talks since 2008 when international efforts to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program collapsed.

In an interview in April with Reuters, President Trump warned that a “major, major conflict” with North Korea was possible, but said he would prefer a diplomatic resolution to the issue of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

The president also told Bloomberg News recently that he would meet North Korean president Kim Jong Un ""under the right circumstances.""

""If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,"" Trump said in the interview.

9,Bruce Smith tells Myles Garrett he must be faster,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero gives the three teams that got the most bang for their buck at the 2017 NFL draft. USA TODAY Sports

BEREA, Ohio (AP) — A physical specimen, consensus best player in the draft and No. 1 overall pick, Myles Garrett came to Cleveland with few noticeable flaws.

Hall of Famer Bruce Smith found one.

After he and Smith watched video together of his college games at Texas A&M, Garrett said the former defensive great was blunt in his assessment of the rookie's game.

""He said I was slow off the ball,"" Garrett said Saturday as the Browns continued their rookie minicamp under sunny skies.

Garrett's reaction?

""I kind of laughed a little bit,"" he said. ""Most people wouldn't say that, but he's one of the greatest, if not the greatest, pass-rusher. If he thinks so and I want to be at his level one day, I got to take his advice and run with it.""

MORE NFL NEWS:

Garrett has had an impressive first two days with the Browns, showing off some of the size and speed that persuaded Cleveland to make him their first selection. Wearing No. 95, Garrett is a presence even when he's standing still, but when he releases off the line and heads toward the quarterback, he's a sight to behold.

""Did you see that guy come off the edge one time today?"" coach Hue Jackson said. ""Holy smoke. Athletic, fast, big, fun. He is very talented. He is going to have to earn the right to be what we think he can be. We are not just going to hand him anything. He understands that. He has to put his head down and work.""

Garrett said Smith, who recorded 200 career sacks during 15 seasons with Buffalo and four in Washington, will be at training camp to work with Cleveland's defensive linemen.

""I know he will be a presence who will mentor me and all of us to be better players on and off the field,"" Garrett said. ""He is going to make us better pass rushers.""

Garrett's goal is to follow in Smith's footsteps, and he is already taking some of the former Pro Bowler's advice to heart.

""He said I was slow off the ball, but that is coming from the very best,"" Garrett said. ""He is just trying to teach me the tricks that I can get off the ball faster and do it even better. If I learn that and keep on practicing that, then I will perform at a high level.""

NOTES: DB Howard Wilson, Cleveland's fourth-round pick, will need surgery after breaking his kneecap. The team said he will miss time during the 2017 season but did not give a timeframe for his recovery. ... ""It's disappointing but this a part of playing football,"" said Wilson, who played at Houston. ""It was kind of a freak thing. I was just running around and my knee just kind of locked up on me."" ... DB Jabrill Peppers was on the field after sitting out Friday when he followed the advice of his agent and didn't sign a participation release. Peppers begins his pro career in the league's substance abuse program after having a diluted urine sample at the scouting combine. He said sitting out Friday had nothing to do with avoiding a drug test. ""I don't know why you think of me like that, but everyone is entitled to an opinion,"" he said. ""What you think of me is no skin off my teeth. I'm not worried about anything but being the best football player and person I can be.""

9,Follow the action from UFC 211: Miocic vs. dos Santos 2 | FOX Sports,"The UFC returns to Dallas this Saturday for a star-studded card featuring two title fights and some of the most talented fighters on the UFC roster.

The main event is home to a Texas-sized showdown between heavyweights Stipe Miocic and Junior dos Santos as they clash in a rematch of their 2014 classic that saw JDS walk away with the unanimous decision. Since then, however, Miocic has gone on to reel off four straight wins, including a title-winning fight against Fabricio Werdum and scored a first-round TKO in his first title defense last September.

Dos Santos is coming off a dominant victory against Ben Rothwell last April and looks to replicate his success from the first fight when he battles Miocic again on Saturday.

In the co-main event, superstar women’s strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk looks for her fifth straight title defense against her toughest matchup to date in heavy-handed Brazilian Jessica Andrade. Jedrzejczyk is approaching Ronda Rousey’s record of six title defenses for a women’s champion but she’ll need to get past Andrade if she wants to keep her impressive streak going.

The main card also features an exciting welterweight bout between Demain Maia and Jorge Masvidal, as well as a key featherweight tilt between high flying Mexican phenom Yair Rodriguez and former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar.

The action gets underway at 6:30PM/3:30PM ETPT on UFC Fight Pass before moving over to FX — not FS1 — for more prelims action at 8PM/5PM. The main card starts at 10PM/7PM and can be seen exclusively on PPV.

9,"Chase Elliott, Michael McDowell collide on pit road at Kansas | FOX Sports","Hendrick Motorsports driver Chase Elliott showed great speed early, until a pit-road mishap in the Go Bowling 400 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Kansas Speedway cost him dearly.

Elliot was running third in the early stages of the race behind leader Martin Truex Jr. when calamity struck.

Landon Cassill lost a right-front tire around the Lap 50 mark, sending most of the racers down pit road for fresh rubber.

As Elliott was pulling out of his pit stall, Michael McDowell was attempting to pit in front of him. The two made contact, causing significant damage to the right-front of Elliott’s No. 24 Chevrolet.

When the race restarted on Lap 55, Elliott restarted way back in 34th following lengthy repairs on pit road. Elliott was able to continue, but his chances of winning were greatly impeded.

9,Torino president says he 'didn't expect so many mistakes' from Joe Hart | FOX Sports,"Torino’s president has offered a less-than-stellar review of Manchester City loanee Joe Hart.

“Hart made a few mistakes, especially when coming out for the ball,” Urbano Cairo said, via EuroSport. “We probably didn’t expect so many mistakes from an England international.” The Torino president stopped short of completely throwing the goalkeeper under the bus, however, saying “but he did some good things, too.”

It’s been an up-and-down first season in Serie A for the 30-year-old England international, who hadn’t spent a professional season playing outside of England prior to joining Torino on loan. Hart started the season strong with Torino, but the mistakes that have plagued his career resurfaced during his time in Italy.

With Torino this season, he’s allowed 54 Serie A goals and has kept just five clean sheets in 34 appearances. The defense in front of him hasn’t done him many favors, but it’s become evident that a change of scenery hasn’t been the tonic Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola likely envisioned.

Though Manchester City’s goalkeeping situation isn’t ideal, it doesn’t seem probable that Hart’s done anything to change Guardiola’s opinion of him. In fact, there’s an argument to be made that Hart’s hold on the England No. 1 position is fading as well.

Stoke’s Jack Butland is waiting in the wings, as is the likes of fellow youngster Jordan Pickford and the experienced Fraser Forster. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that, but it certainly seems that Hart might well regret opting to accept a loan to Torino.

His talent is undeniable, but he’s done little to dispel the notion of being error-prone. It’s unknown where his career goes from here and a return to the Premier League could be in the cards, but it’d be surprising if it’s as City’s No. 1.

9,"After World Cup biting incident, Luis Suarez was moved to tears by Barcelona's interest | FOX Sports","Luis Suarez was sure he had ruined his move from Liverpool to Barcelona. He was caught for the third time in his career biting an opponent during the 2014 World Cup and FIFA came down hard, banning him from any soccer-related activity for four months over the controversial incident.

But Barcelona maintained their interest in the striker anyway, paying £65 million to sign the Uruguayan for the 2015-16 season, and now Suarez reveals it was something that not only shocked him but touched him and moved him to tears.

“I remember during that time, I spoke with Andoni [Zubizarreta] and I spent most of the time crying because I couldn’t believe they still liked me and wanted me,” he told El Periodico via Marca. “It gave me great determination to get back.

“Sometimes I look at photos and videos of those days. I was locked up in a 10×10 mini-gym with Juanjo [Brau] looking for places to go running without the press discovering me. … My kids would ask me why I wasn’t with the team and I’d tell them, without lying. It was a very hard time.”

The move looked like it could be a big risk for Barcelona. If Suarez had been caught biting an opponent again, as he had when he played for Ajax, Liverpool and for the Uruguay national team, he likely would’ve faced a very harsh punishment from FIFA. Instead, Suarez has enjoyed a breakout run with Barcelona and, though he wasn’t able to earn recognition ahead of perennial favorites Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, he was arguably the best player in all of Europe last season.

It hasn’t hurt that, in Barcelona, Suarez has teamed up with two of the best players right now, Messi and Neymar.

“It is the dream of any No.9 to play alongside two of the best players in the world,” he said in the same interview. “When you are playing in close games, they open them and make a difference.”

The trio won the La Liga title last season and could be on their way to another one, especially since Suarez has been on his best behavior and unwilling to repeat his past controversies.

9,Indians-Twins game put on hold after rogue squirrel scampers on field | FOX Sports,"Saturday afternoon’s Cleveland Indians – Minnesota Twins game was put on hold for several minutes when a squirrel decided it wanted to get in on the action.

The squirrel first popped up in right field in the bottom of the sixth inning, and then ran across the infield and around the home plate area trying desperately to find an escape route, to the delight of the Progressive Field crowd.

The grounds crew then joined in on the fun, trying to chase ol’ Squirrelly out a doorway on the left field line. But the squirrel, perhaps realizing that this was its 15 minutes of fame, went bold and jumped into the stands instead — not content to throw away its shot.

Sherman, who dropped his first two UFC bouts, started fast and furious as he used his length to land straight punches and heavy hooks at will throughout the first round. Sherman also found success battering Coulter’s lead leg with kicks that hobbled his opponent throughout the opening round.

The second round started again in Sherman’s favor as he dropped Coulter early in the stanza and jumped on top of the UFC newcomer for some ground-and-pound. The Texas native, Coulter, was able to work his way back to his feet, which caused the Dallas crowd to erupt in cheers.

Coulter fed off those cheers for the next two minutes as he and Sherman stood toe-to-toe exchanging heavy blows despite that fact that Coulter was visibly impaired from the kicks in the opening round.

Still, Sherman was content on getting the job done with his hands — and elbows — instead of his legs, and he finally put Coulter away with a beautiful right elbow that landed flush to the side of his opponent’s head and sent him crumbling to the canvas.

Seven-time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson was attempting to pass 2004 champ Kurt Busch on the frontstretch at around the Lap-100 mark.

The two touched briefly, and the contact resulted in a flat left-rear tire on Johnson’s No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet.

As Johnson circulated around the track, debris from his tire tore up some of the bodywork on his car, leading NASCAR to throw a caution flag on Lap 102.

Because Johnson had to circulate at low speed with the flat tire, he fell off the lead lap. Johnson, who is tied with Jeff Gordon for most career wins at Kansas, restarted 36th in the race.

Earlier in the race, Johnson’s teammate Chase Elliott was taken out of contention for the victory when he collided with Michael McDowell on pit road.

9,Eddie Alvarez vs. Dustin Poirier ends in controversy after illegal strikes stop the fight | FOX Sports,"DALLAS — The highly anticipated feature preliminary bout at UFC 211 ended in controversy after an illegal knee put an end to the fight between Eddie Alvarez and Dustin Poirier.

It all went down in the second round after both fighters nearly put a stop to the contest in a wild affair between two of the top lightweights in the world.

Following a strong opening round, Poirier saw an opening in the second that nearly earned him a knockout win over a former lightweight champion when he connected with a hard punch as Alvarez was moving forward that sent him reeling backwards towards the cage.

Poirier saw his opponent wounded and opened up with a barrage of strikes that nearly brought an end to the fight as the Dallas crowd roared with each punch landed. Somehow, Alvarez centered himself enough to counter back with a big looping shot that blasted Poirier and put him on rubber legs instead.

Poirier grabbed onto Alvarez as the two fighters engaged in a clinch against the cage. Unfortunately as Poirier went down to the ground to fight off a front headlock, Alvarez uncorked a trio of knees to the head.

The final shot saw Poirier drop to the mat just as referee Herb Dean rushed in for the stoppage, but not because the fight was over. Instead, Dean paused the contest because the knee strikes were all to the head while Poirier had his knees on the mat, which meant they were illegal.

Poirier struggled to get back to the stool after sitting on the ground for a few moments and it was clear he was still rocked from the shot to the head. It didn’t take long for Dean to wave off the fight and call a stop as Poirier was unable to continue.

While the strikes were deemed illegal, Dean declared that the knees were “accidental” and the fight was declared a no contest rather than a disqualification.

Afterwards, Alvarez and Poirier shook hands and both agreed that they’d like the run the fight back at some point in the future following the disappointing outcome on Saturday night.

It was an unfortunate end to an otherwise stellar fight as Alvarez and Poirier truly went to battle until they couldn’t battle anymore.",fox-sports

But not only did Tigres find a goal on Saturday — they found a moment of magic, courtesy of Frenchman André-Pierre Gignac. Take a look:

He’s standing maybe 35 yards out and he just launches the ball around the wall and inside the far post. It’s a beautiful strike — he couldn’t have hit it much sweeter than that. Gignac would come back and score another, but there was no topping his first effort:

9,David Branch returns to the UFC with split decision win over Krzysztof Jotko | FOX Sports,"DALLAS — David Branch waited a long time to return to the UFC but now he’s back in the win column after eking out a split decision over top 10 ranked middleweight Krzysztof Jotko.

While it wasn’t the most exciting affair, Branch did what he had to do to get the win while using a grappling heavy attack to ground Jotko’s striking over three rounds.

A high level submission specialist, Branch waited for an opening to dive forward and take Jokto to the mat about two minutes into the first round, but he couldn’t hold him there for very long.

Jotko worked back to his feet but couldn’t get away from Branch’s iron grip as he locked him up in the clinch against the cage while firing away with short punches and knees.

The fighters exchanged punches back and forth throughout the second round with neither one really gaining a definitive advantage. Branch did manage to blast forward with another takedown but barely hit the mat before Jotko had a leg under him so he could work back to the feet in an instant.

Jotko started opening up with offense more as time ticked away, throwing a series of long punches and even a spinning wheel kick before Branch grabbed onto a body lock for a takedown.

Jotko consistently gave up the takedown but bounced back to his feet almost as quickly on every occasion.

The crowd got restless in the third with Branch once again locking up Jotko against the cage as the action stalled amidst both fighters jockeying for position.

Jotko tried to look for strikes any time he was separated from Branch, but he couldn’t avoid the grappling exchanges, which came often over the 15 minute fight. When it was over, the Dallas faithful expressed their displeasure in the fight as Branch and Jotko awaited the decision.

Ultimately, the judges gave the fight to Branch by split decision with two cards of 29-28 in his favor with the third going 29-28 to Jotko.

“Chew me up,” Branch said to the media as he left the Octagon, clearly not happy with his performance despite getting the win.

It had been several years since Branch competed in the UFC and perhaps he suffered through a few jitters but he still earned a victory, which is what mattered most in the end.",fox-sports
9,"Danica Patrick, Joey Logano, Aric Almirola in violent, fiery crash | FOX Sports","There was a scary moment in Saturday’s Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway, shortly after a restart with 69 laps to go.

Joey Logano’s Team Penske Ford turned left heading into Turn 1 after an apparent mechanical failure on the front end, sending Danica Patrick hard into the wall as the two were racing for 11th place in the race.

“Something broke in the car, I don’t know what it was,” said Logano. “… I tried to check up but you’re going 215 miles per hour.

“I’m praying for Aric right now,” added Logano.

Patrick’s car exploded into flames and then both Patrick and Logano got hit by a hard-charging Aric Almirola, who clobbered both cars in Turn 2. Patrick and Logano quickly got out of their cars, but Almirola remained in his No. 43 Richard Petty Motorsports Ford.

The race was red-flagged as safety workers had to extricate Almirola from his car. Immediately after the impact, Almirola dropped his window net, but he did not get out of his car. Instead, safety workers removed the windshield and the rood of his car and worked to extricate him from the damaged vehicle.

Almirola was taken out of the car and placed on a spine board and a stretcher. He was awake and alert when the rescue workers took him out of the car and loaded him into the ambulance.

1,"Warned he would die by age 10, he just graduated college","(CNN) On Saturday, 29-year-old Ryan Dant walked across the stage in his cap and gown as he graduated from his dream school, the University of Louisville.

It's remarkable because Ryan wasn't expected to attend college, let alone the school whose logo he wore on T-shirts and basketball jerseys as a toddler. Because underneath that cap and gown, medications are circulating through his entire body to make this moment possible. Because his parents never gave up, even when they heard there was no chance.

It's remarkable because Ryan is still alive, despite being born with a death sentence in his genes.

The normal beginnings of rare disease

His father, Mark Dant, likes to say that Ryan was born with a love for baseball. The night before his birth, his parents went to a Texas Rangers game.

The healthy, beautiful boy was born in 1988, weighing 8 pounds, 13 ounces. He was perfect, Mark said. At the age of 3, he could throw a baseball so hard that his mom, Jeanne, made a ""no ball in the house"" rule. Every night, Ryan would watch baseball games with his family on TV, cheering on Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan. He loved the fact that he could see his own name on the back of the baseball player's jersey.

Ryan Dant with baseball legend Nolan Ryan.

Before enrolling him in day care at age 3, Jeanne took Ryan to the pediatrician. What was supposed to be a routine checkup revealed that Ryan's liver and spleen were too large, and the Dants were referred to a geneticist. Mark, who had just made lieutenant at the police department in Carrollton, Texas, didn't believe anything was wrong with his son. He didn't go with them to see the geneticist. But two weeks later, tests confirmed the diagnosis.

The geneticist said Ryan had a rare genetic disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis I, or MPS I, with a wide-range of symptoms affecting multiple systems in the body. The mutation forms in a gene that makes an enzyme that helps break down byproducts of chemical reactions in cells. The enzyme can't be produced, leading to a buildup of this byproduct that can cause damage to cells, tissues and organs.

It explained why his spleen and liver were enlarged; the buildup made them 2½ times larger than normal.

The geneticist told the Dants that Ryan would die by the time he was 10 or 12. Over time, they would see him change. He would be in a lot of pain, possibly go blind and deaf, suffer a stiffening and curling of the muscles in his limbs that would put him a wheelchair. He would decline mentally.

Soon, he would lose the ability to play baseball.

Mark Dant pressed the doctor, asking about research or medications.

"" 'You have to understand, your son has a disease that is so rare that there aren't many scientists working on it,' "" he recalls the doctor saying. ""He was telling us to take him home and love him, because he wouldn't be around long.""

MPS I affects one in 100,000 children globally, according to the National Organization for Rare Diseases.

The Dants immediately decided not to tell Ryan; he was too young to understand. They cried in the hallway before taking him home. That became the new normal for them: crying at night, separately, after Ryan went to sleep. When they weren't crying, they were watching him sleep, waiting for the inevitable. Mark would wake up on the floor next to Ryan's bed every day.

""I remember that year being so incredibly painful because we had a happy, playful little boy who was no different than he was before we walked into the examination room, but everything we knew about him was going to change,"" Mark said. ""And there was nothing we could do about it at all.""

They spent a year in mourning. But the Dants began to wonder whether there was something they could do. Surely, there were other families out there dealing with MPS I.

""I decided after a year to get up off the floor and do something about it,"" Mark said.

Tracking down a scientist

Mark started by attending a conference for the National MPS Society. He was shaken and heartbroken to see children in various states of decline. There were no teenagers.

After that, he spent his free time at the library, reading about genetics and the little information available about MPS I. Mark's research led him to an international symposium in Germany, where a scientist presented on enzyme replacement therapy for another rare disease. He asked the scientist whether it was possible to develop a similar therapy for MPS I.

It's possible, he was told, but it will take a lot of time and money. Both were in short supply.

All Mark needed to hear was that it was possible. He decided to buy time. After returning home, he researched nonprofits and started the Ryan Foundation . A bake sale in the family's driveway raised $342.

Through an MPS Society event, Mark connected with another scientist who told him about her brilliant former student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Emil Kakkis was working on an enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I, but struggled due to lack of funding. After meeting Kakkis, Mark knew that he had found the right person.

""He is the most dedicated person because he wants to treat the untreated,"" Mark said.

They began a partnership. Donations to the Ryan Foundation would fund Kakkis' research, hoping to make the therapy a real treatment.

Ryan, 5, with his parents after one of the many fundraisers his father arranged for MPS research.

With the support of their community, golf tournaments, corporate donors and philanthropists who learned about the Dant family through news articles, funding began to grow.

'What will it be like when I die?'

Meanwhile, Ryan was declining. His hands were so stiff that he couldn't move them. By age 5, he had to bend over to put a shirt on because he couldn't raise his arms above his head. Mark attached Velcro to his baseball bat and sewed it to his little batting gloves so Ryan could grip it. He struggled to breathe at times.

By age 7, he had to stop playing. Saturday morning baseball games and practices were replaced with physical therapy and doctors appointments. Mark started driving out of his way to avoid going past the baseball field. It caused both of them too much pain.

Severe headaches would cause Ryan to vomit until he passed out. Just thinking about the headaches scared the boy.

Trying to play soccer, he collapsed after rupturing an umbilical hernia. That night, he asked, ""Dad, what's it going to be like when I die?"" He asked whether his dog would be with him and where his parents would be. And then he fell asleep.

Mark realized that while they had tried to shield him as much as possible, Ryan knew more than they thought. Other kids at school had heard from their parents that their classmate was in newspaper articles. The stories said he would die, so his classmates said the same thing.

They needed hope more than ever.

Kakkis had been working into the night every night, year after year. He used the funds for researchers and machines. A biotechnology company called BioMarin, formed in 1997, was interested in turning the therapy into a drug called Aldurazyme.

A clinical trial was approved in 1998, and Ryan was invited to be one of 10 children to undergo the therapy in Los Angeles. It was his only chance.

In 1998, Ryan began participating in the trial.

He was scared and didn't understand why he had to leave his friends to live in another place for months.

""I met Ryan as a very afraid little boy who knew that he was going to have to do these weekly infusions,"" said nurse Sarah McNeil, who assisted him during the trial. She worked at a collaborating site at UT Southwestern Medical Center near the Dants' home.

After a few weeks of therapy, Ryan couldn't believe ""how little my tummy is."" The enzyme replacement therapy was working, removing years of built-up byproduct in his liver and spleen and returning them to normal size. He continued to respond extremely well to the treatment.

Some of the children had allergic reactions to the infusions, but the trial was expanded over four years. The drug would receive marketing approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2003.

Over time, Ryan began to feel normal. His hands uncurled, the headaches went away, and he was able to start playing baseball again. He had lived to see age 12, defying the odds.

""It was a really great feeling to be back as a part of the team and be able to play a sport that I love so much,"" Ryan said. ""I could slide back into the normalcy of being a kid again, pick up where I left off, meet my best friend.""

Ryan began to talk about his early childhood dreams for the future again. He wanted to get a driver's license, go to prom, buy a Mustang and go to the University of Louisville. The weekly four-hour IV drip of Aldurazyme was lengthening his expected lifespan, making all of those dreams into possibilities.

Years of middle school and high school were filled with the perfectly normal things that someone Ryan's age should be enjoying. He was even able to eventually buy his Mustang.

But another obstacle was just around the bend.

The enemy within

In the latter years of high school, the lights in Ryan's brain began to turn off. He would study all weekend for an exam, only to have no memory of the information on Monday morning. He was able to graduate, but the problem only grew worse as he moved on to community college.

His annual summer cognitive testing at the University of Minnesota confirmed it: Despite his physical improvement, the mental decline they had always feared was happening, and at a rapid rate.

After years of writing to the equipment manager for the University of Louisville's football team, Ryan had been told that as soon as he could take a full course load, there was a scholarship waiting for him with the equipment staff. There, he would be able to pursue his dream of working in sports.

Ryan with his father at a Texas Rangers World Series game in 2010.

But his cognitive decline meant he wouldn't be able to go to college.

The Dants learned that another clinical trial was happening at UCLA in 2011, one that was testing whether injecting the enzyme into the spinal fluid would help clear byproduct out of the brain. Ryan latched onto the hope of that trial.

But when they tested Ryan by injecting dye into his spinal fluid, it pooled rather than traveling to the brain due to the narrow and clogged pathway of his spine. He didn't qualify for the trial.

He broke down and sank into a deep depression. A month later, he posted on Facebook, musing about how the journey was never over and full of bumps in the road.

McNeil, the nurse from the first clinical trial, had formed a bond with the Dant family. A friend of Ryan's on Facebook, she saw the post. She feared the worst and reached out to Ryan and his dad, asking what had happened.

When they told her, it broke her heart. ""I just thought, 'He's made it this far. This just can't be it,' "" McNeil said. Ryan is one of four patients from the original ten in the first clinical trial that is still alive.

McNeil happened to be working with a neuro-oncologist, Dr. Elizabeth Maher, at the O'Donnell Brain Institute at UT Southwestern Medical Center, mostly with brain tumor patients. She told Maher about Ryan's story and the defeat he felt over his exclusion from the trial.

McNeil raised the question: What if they could use the UCLA trial protocol to get the drug and begin a compassionate use study? Compassionate use is outside of a clinical trial for a medical product that has not been approved, according to the FDA.

""Why wouldn't we do this?"" Maher responded. She recognized that the science was excellent and that it was a potential treatment to help the enzyme cross the blood-brain barrier -- protective ""Saran wrap for the brain"" -- which Aldurazyme couldn't do. But Maher worried about the risk of delivering this enzyme into the spinal fluid and whether it was safe. As they worked through the process to begin the study, the safety question kept Maher up at night.

But Ryan was losing memory retention every day. To him, the benefits outweighed the risk.

In April 2012, the study began. Every 12 weeks, he would go in for a spinal tap that required him to lie on his stomach for 24 hours.

The latest in a series of spinal injections for Ryan. The first injection happened in 2012.

After a month, Ryan felt like his ability to memorize had improved. By three months in, he was reading. After four months, Ryan came running into the clinic to tell Maher that he read a book all the way through over the weekend and remembered it.

The treatment didn't just stop his cognitive decline. In a groundbreaking development, the infusion reversed it.

""All we hoped for was that we could stabilize it,"" Maher said. ""We had no expectation at all that he would improve. What this shows is that the right drug that does its specific function, even in the brain, can lead to neuro-cognitive recovery. The damage we thought was being done to the brain was not permanently impairing those circuits. The lights were just turned off. Then, those circuits began to fire really quickly.""

Hope beyond tomorrow

After getting his associate's degree at Brookhaven College in Texas, Ryan was finally able to attend the University of Louisville and take a full course load. He also began working for the equipment staff.

Cognitive testing showed an increase. His grades improved to As and Bs, and he appeared on the athletic director's honor roll for the past three years.

This weekend, Ryan graduated with a bachelor's degree in sports administration. He wants to work in sports management for a professional team.

Ryan became the football team's equipment manager. Here, he stands next to 2016 Heisman winner Lamar Jackson (No. 8).

His hard work ethic has made it possible, and the weekly four-hour IV drips and quarterly spinal injections continue until better science comes along.

detailing Ryan's case study. Kakkis attended the graduation. Maher firmly believes that people like him and Mark Dant can change the world. Aldurazyme is now the only approved treatment for MPS I patients. A clinical trial at UCLA, using the treatment that has helped Ryan cognitively, continues. A paper was published this yeardetailing Ryan's case study.

""Mark's desperate search for a treatment for his son has led to insights into neuro-cognitive recovery that was unimaginable,"" Maher said.

""Some parents don't really have the desire or drive to do as much work as my parents have,"" Ryan said. ""It's amazing to see how hard they've worked to improve my life. After being able to walk across the stage and see the journey that I've had, now I can see what my next goal is: find a great job, get married, have a family and enjoy life.""

Ryan has always been told what will happen. Now, the gift of not knowing is the greatest one he could have, Mark said.

""For many, many years, I wouldn't allow myself to visualize Ryan in a cap and gown and enjoying what it might feel like to be a college graduate, because it wasn't going to happen,"" Mark said. ""But Ryan, and so many others, made it possible by not giving up.""

This is why Ryan's graduation isn't just one of thousands happening across the country this month. He's one in a million.",cnn

PITTSBURGH — Bobby Ryan scored at 4:59 of overtime to give the underdog Ottawa Senators a 2-1 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins in Game 1 of the best-of-seven Eastern Conference final.

Here’s how the Senators downed the Penguins:

The game-winner: Ryan drove past Pittsburgh defenseman Olli Maatta and scored on a nice forehand-backhand shot into the top of the net.

The other goal: Senators leading scorer Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored his eighth goal of the playoffs at 14:32 of the first period. Ryan created the scoring chance with a behind-the-back pass to Pageau, who was inside the right wing circle.

Ottawa goalie Craig Anderson was sharp: Anderson had superb body positioning and rebound control. He was aggressive in his crease and made 27 saves.

What hurt the Penguins: Going 0-for-5 on the power play. Senators penalty killers didn’t allow many clean shots at the net.

The star: Defenseman Erik Karlsson is the Senators’ nuclear generator. He fuels the Senators’ attack. He controls the game. Through 60 minutes, he led all players with six shots on goal.

KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) — Danica Patrick's frustrating season continued Saturday night when Joey Logano turned into her entering the first turn and sent the No. 10 car headfirst into the wall at Kansas Speedway.

Eric Almirola plowed into Logano's car as it skidded along the wall, the force of their impact sending the rear of the No. 43 into the air. Almirola's car came to rest near the outside fence, and it took safety crews cutting off the roof to safely get him out.

Patrick got out of her flaming car after it came to rest on the apron. When Logano tried to speak to her as they got into an ambulance, Patrick appeared to brusquely brush him off.

Patrick and Logano were running just outside the top 10 with 67 laps to go.

3,Paris Jackson explains nude Instagram posts,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Paris Jackson recently attended the Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual Met Gala in New York City

Paris Jackson has a message for her 1.4 million followers on Instagram - nudity is natural and ""part of what makes us human"".

The model and only daughter of the late pop superstar Michael Jackson had earlier been criticised for posting a photo of herself lying in the sun topless alongside her dog - using a pair of strategically placed beetle emojis to cover her nipples.

That post appears to have later been deleted. But Paris, 19, later posted another picture of herself - this time topless and smoking, in black and white - alongside a long message hitting out at critics.

Nudism ""started as a movement for 'going back to nature',"" she wrote, ""and was even called a philosophy"". It helps her connect to the earth and is a ""beautiful thing"" that does not have to be seen as sexual, she said.

""Feminism is being able to express yourself in your own way, whether it's being conservative and wearing lots of clothes or showing yourself.""

She continued: ""The human body is a beautiful thing and no matter what 'flaws' you have, whether it be scars, or extra weight, stretch marks, freckles, whatever, it is beautiful and you should express yourself however you feel comfortable.

""If this makes some of you upset i completely understand and i encourage you to maybe no longer follow me, but i cannot apologize for this in any way. it is who i am and i refuse to shy away and keep my beliefs a secret.""

Paris Jackson has recently been in the spotlight, after having reportedly signed a seven-figure deal to be the face of Calvin Klein. She recently attended the Met Gala in New York as a guest of the brand and will also appear in an upcoming Amazon Studios film alongside David Oyelowo, Amanda Seyfried and Charlize Theron, Deadline reports.

Paris was just 11 when Michael Jackson died on 25 June, 2009. She recently told Rolling Stone magazine she believed her father was murdered.

The singer died from an overdose of the powerful anaesthetic propofol. His doctor Conrad Murray was later found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

Paris also revealed to Rolling Stone that she had been sexually assaulted by a ""complete stranger"" as a teenager, and spoke openly about depression and a suicide attempt in 2013.",bbc-news
9,NASCAR driver Aric Almirola airlifted to hospital after fiery crash at Kansas,"Aric Almirola (43) crashes into Danica Patrick and Joey Logano during the NASCAR Cup race at Kansas Speedway. (Photo: Colin E. Braley, AP)

Aric Almirola has been airlifted to the University of Kansas Medical Center for evaluation after his involvement in a fiery, three-car crash at Kansas Speedway during Saturday night's Go Bowling 400 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race.

The crash appeared to be caused when something on Joey Logano's No. 22 Ford broke, sending him hard into Danica Patrick's No. 10 Ford in Turn 1 shortly after a restart on Lap 69. Almirola, who was trailing, came up on the wreck and hit both cars hard, lifting the No. 43 Ford's back wheels off the racing surface.

Almirola's window net was lowered but safety crews continued to work to release him from the car, removing the windscreen and cutting off the top of the car. He was alert when he was pulled from the car and was placed on a board.

9,Frankie Edgar absolutely demolishes Yair Rodriguez in lopsided performance | FOX Sports,"DALLAS — Frankie Edgar heard all about the hype surrounding Yair Rodriguez going into UFC 211 on Saturday night.

He then proceeded to smash that hype into a million pieces as Edgar absolutely demolished Rodriguez over two rounds until the fight was stopped on the advice of the ringside physician.

Despite giving up size and reach to his opponent, Edgar showed no fear getting right in his face as soon as the fight started before landing a stinging right hand that rattled Rodriguez.

Edgar continued his assault with a big takedown against the cage before he began hammering away at Rodriguez from the top with punches and elbows from inside the guard.

While Rodriguez did his best to play defense on the ground, Edgar absolutely mauled him with punches while opening up a huge cut on his cheek as blood started streaming across his face.

Edgar wasted no time planting Rodriguez on the mat with another huge takedown in the second although the young Mexican prospect did his best to grab onto a knee bar on the mat to slow him down.

Edgar finally slipped his leg through and then just started battering Rodriguez with punches and elbows once again.

Rodriguez was like a turtle on his back with Edgar just having his way with the former “Ultimate Fighter” winner as the mouse on his eye just continued to swell with each shot landed.

As Rodriguez went to the corner, the ringside physician came into check on the swollen eye that was completely shut by this point in the fight. Rather than sending Rodriguez back out with little to no vision from his eye, the fight was stopped.

Edgar earns the TKO victory while reminding the world that he’s still an elite featherweight as Rodriguez looks to regroup following his first loss in the UFC.

9,Martin Truex Jr. wins Kansas race marred by fiery wreck | FOX Sports,"Martin Truex Jr. won the Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway on Saturday night, but the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race ended on a somewhat somber note after a frightening, fiery crash left driver Aric Almirola in a local hospital.

It was a wild night for sure, and not only because Almirola had to be airlifted to the University of Kansas Medical Center after being cut from his No. 43 Richard Petty Motorsports Ford.

There were a series of wrecks over the final 25 laps. Truex survived them all to win at Kansas after tough luck prevented him from doing so on two occasions recently when he had the dominant car but couldn’t park it in Victory Lane.

“We finally did it! You are one hell of a crew chief!” Truex shouted into his team radio as he took the checkered flag, referring to crew chief Cole Pearn.

Truex Jr. passed Ryan Blaney for the lead with 25 laps to go, but Corey LaJoie hit the wall just one lap later — sending the leaders to pit road. Blaney’s No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing Ford beat the No. 78 Furniture Row Racing Toyota of Truex off pit road by a nose, but could not hold Truex off on the subsequent restart with 19 laps remaining.

Then, after Truex pulled away and appeared to be cruising toward victory, his Furniture Row Racing teammate Erik Jones got turned by Ty Dillon, bringing out the 14th caution of the long night. That set up yet another restart with Truex, as the leader, choosing the inside line on the front row with Blaney lined up on his outside.

The 15th caution and still another restart loomed right behind, as the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota of Denny Hamlin touched the left-rear of Kurt Busch’s No. 41 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford, and Busch shot into the No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevy of Jimmie Johnson.

Blaney started the race from the pole, won Stage 2 and led a total of 83 laps.

But in the end, Blaney could not hold off Truex, who earned his second victory of the season. He also won earlier at Las Vegas.

The night took on a somber tone shortly after a restart with 69 laps to go when a part appeared to break in the right-front of Joey Logano’s No. 22 Team Penske Ford, triggering a terrifying high-speed wreck with the No. 10 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford of Danica Patrick and the No. 43 Ford of Almirola.

After the part appeared to break in Logano’s car, he hooked Patrick – and then Almirola, who was trying to check up behind them, plowed into both cars, hitting Logano’s almost head-on as all three cars burst into a collective ball of fire.

Almirola had to be cut from his car by safety workers and was placed in an ambulance on spine board and a stretcher, and subsequently was airlifted to the University of Kansas Medical Center. FOX Sports was told that Almirola was awake and alert, and that he was being kept there for further observation and evaluation.

After a lengthy delay to remove Almirola from his car and get the track cleaned up, the race resumed with Blaney in the lead.

Truex, however, had the better car on the longer runs and was stalking him. After retaking the lead following the restart with 19 to go, Truex gradually built a lead and then survived the series of restarts down the stretch.

Earlier, Kyle Busch won Stage 1 and led much of Stage 2 – but faded back toward the end of the second one as Blaney surged back to the front and won it.

Chase Elliott, driver of the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet was running third in the early stages of the race when Landon Cassill lost a right-front tire around the Lap 50 mark, sending most of the rest of the field, including Elliott, down pit road for fresh rubber.

As Elliott was pulling out of his pit stall, Michael McDowell was attempting to pit in front of him. The two made contact, causing significant damage to the right-front of Elliott’s No. 24 Chevrolet.

When the race restarted on Lap 55, Elliott restarted way back in 34th following lengthy repairs on pit road. Elliott was able to continue, but his chances of winning were over.

With seven wins in a row including a split decision victory over Jorge Masvidal at UFC 211 on Saturday night, Maia will get a crack at welterweight champion Tyron Woodley in his next fight.

It was another classic Maia fight as he took away Masvidal’s most dangerous weapons on the feet while fishing for submissions for 15 straight minutes.

In his most recent performances, Maia has all but told his opponents when the fight begins that he’s going to drag them to the ground and it was exactly the same at the start of this fight as Maia went after Masvidal’s legs immediately before dragging him to the ground and taking his back.

To Masvidal’s credit, he was able to get back to his feet during the scramble but he still had Maia wrapped around him like an anaconda.

For the majority of the round, Maia tried to get a rear naked choke submission, but Masvidal stayed patient while never getting into too much danger.

When Masvidal finally worked his way free with just seconds remaining in the round, he began firing off a series of hard punches as Maia laid prone on the mat.

While the end of the round didn’t go his way, Maia quickly darted back out to look for the takedown in the second but this time Masvidal resisted his attempts to drag the fight to the ground.

As time ticked on, Masvidal seemed to be turning the momentum in his favor but Maia was relentless with his takedown attempts before pulling the fight back down to the mat. Maia once again took the back while peppering away with punches as Masvidal played defense on the ground.

As the final round got underway, Masvidal took the center of the Octagon but didn’t really unleash much offensively but instead waited for Maia to finally dive forward for the takedown.

It didn’t come through the first couple of minutes, but Maia finally pressed the action before dragging Masvidal back down to the ground and taking his back yet again.

Maia’s control on the mat was absolutely stifling and as much as Masvidal was able to resist his submissions, he just couldn’t wiggle free to do any damage of his own.

The judges scored the fight 29-28 two times over for Maia with the third judge giving the fight 29-28 to Masvidal.

With the win, Maia went over to the corner where UFC president Dana White was sitting so he could ask him for a title shot yet again.

“You got it,” White said in response.

It appears Maia will now get the next crack at Woodley and the welterweight title later this year.",fox-sports
9,Bryce Harper's strange signing for 2018 won't mean much in the long run | FOX Sports,"The oddest of tea leaves fell on Saturday — news that Bryce Harper and the Nationals had agreed upon a $21.625 million contract for 2018, avoiding his final year of arbitration.

I cannot recall another deal like this being struck in mid-May, and the curious timing raised the usual questions about Harper’s future with the Nats, and whether he will sign an extension before reaching free agency.

My guess is no, that Harper is not going to concede the 2018-19 market to Manny Machado and others without fully exploring his value.

Harper after hitting a walk-off two-run home run Saturday night. (Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports)

One rival agent speculated that the Harper deal was the byproduct of a long-term discussion, and that the agreement simply amounted to a tabling of negotiations. But Harper, his agent, Scott Boras and the Nationals all denied that theory, saying their discussions were limited to the one-year contract for ’18.

Whatever, no one should rule out the Nats coughing up $400 million, or whatever the number for Harper will be, given Boras’ relationship with the team’s ownership. As I’ve written before, Nats ownership operates to its own rhythm, with Boras frequently calling out the beats.

Frequently. But not always.

Harper’s 2018 contract is the largest one-year deal for an arbitration-eligible player, but the number might have been higher if the Nationals had not stared down Boras in a dispute at the start of his arbitration process.

The dispute stemmed from the contract Harper signed as the No. 1 pick in the 2010 draft. Harper and Boras contended that Harper had the right to opt out of his negotiated 2015 salary and enter arbitration. The Nats said they never included opt-out language in the deal.

The difference amounted to four years of arbitration vs. three. Rather than go to a grievance they might have lost, Boras and Harper accepted a two-year, $7.5 million deal, with two more years of arbitration to follow. Therein lied the problem: A player’s salary in arbitration ascends like a staircase, with each number built upon the other.

Geoff Burke/USA TODAY Sports

Harper, by starting at a reduced rate, never realized the value he would have attained if Boras had secured him the opt-out language, giving him four years in the process. His two-year deal left him with a $5 million salary last season — a relatively low number for an arbitration-eligible player coming off the 2015 National League MVP award.

So, how much did Harper ultimately sacrifice?

Boras might argue nothing, saying that Harper likely would have made the same in three years of arbitration as he did in the two-year deal and the two subsequent arb years.

Yet, in the estimation of one rival agent, Harper might have earned $55 million over four true years of arbitration. Instead, Harper will get $42.75 million in that time frame, on top of the $8.9 million from his initial draft deal, then enter the free-agent market at 26.

Dude ain’t going hungry — those are unprecedented earnings for a player his age.

Still, the question lingers: Why the rush to sign for ’18?

Harper, batting .368 with 11 homers and a 1.220 OPS, is currently ahead of his MVP pace, and leads the majors with a .493 on-base percentage. On Saturday night, he hit his second walkoff homer of the season and fifth of his career. At this rate, he could have built a monster case in arbitration, perhaps armed with his second MVP in three years.

This is Bryce Harper's 5th career walk off HR and his first since … … last month. pic.twitter.com/6HtfbKFMEj — Washington Nationals (@Nationals) May 14, 2017

Boras, however, landed Harper a raise of nearly $8 million from his current salary of $13.63 million, with the chance to earn another $1 million in incentives. Could the two have pushed the number higher? Probably. But Boras said he placed a value on Harper’s peace of mind.

“If you can get a player comfortable with this kind of team over these next two years prior to free agency, it just increases the window of opportunity for him to just focus on the game,” Boras said. “The greatest likelihood of optimal performance is when you have these kinds of things completed. The player is just not thinking about it.”

Well, Harper would have gotten his money, anyway; the process all but guarantees it. Harper also is one who embraces every challenge; his confidence is part of what makes him so great.

General managers surely will chuckle at Boras’ emphasis on freeing Harper’s mind, citing any number of examples when the agent turned down extensions that could have assured such tranquility for other clients. Boras, though, generally does not push it in arbitration — his last hearing was a victory for Pedro Alvarez over the Pirates in ’15.

In any case, Harper will not hold the arb record for long.

Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson, earning $17 million this season, might surpass Harper’s $21.625 million deal next winter as a fourth-year eligible. The Rockies’ Nolan Arenado, who will earn $17.75 next season, should go higher on as a fourth-year eligible in 2018-19; he already has hit 40 homers twice and won four Gold Glove awards.

For a second there after Donald Trump (Alec Baldwin) flat-out admitted he fired FBI director James Comey over the Russia investigation, NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt (Michael Che) thought the long national nightmare was over.

""So, did I get him?"" he said to the producer in his ear. ""Is this all over?""

Alas, no, he was told.

""No, I didn't?"" he asked dejectedly. ""Nothing matters anymore? Absolutely nothing matters anymore?""

""Wait, so, did I get him?"" #SNLLiveCoastToCoastpic.twitter.com/iePaQf2fbD — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) May 14, 2017

""I've got the Republicans in the palm of my hand,"" Trump explained, summoning his ice cream boy (Mikey Day as House Speaker Paul Ryan in soda jerk livery).

""Beat it, nerd,"" the president told him after he delivered dessert.

""He feeds me dog food!"" Ryan volunteered.

Returning his attention to Holt, Trump insisted he was nothing like disgraced President Richard Nixon, who probably only got one scoop of ice cream.

""Yes, sir,"" Holt acknowledged, adding, ""You're very different from Nixon because he won the popular vote."" (Ouch.)

Trump attempted to pat himself on the back for what he accomplished this week, like ""letting Kellyanne out of her crypt"" and inventing the economic phrase ""priming the pump"" (what he does to speed conjugal visits with Melania, ew), earning himself an Anderson Cooper eye roll.

Always gotta have an emergency @AndersonCooper eye roll on standby. 🙄 #SNLLiveCoastToCoastpic.twitter.com/5cX8loIQKI — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) May 14, 2017

Holt then tried to get him to confirm whether he taped his conversations with Comey.

""I tape a lot of people, whenever I want,"" Trump said nonchalantly. ""Some people have called me a serial tapist and it's true, I am. When you're president, they let you do it.""

Next, Holt asked him for reassurance that Trump wouldn't replace Comey with ""someone crazy, like Judge Judy.""

""I can promise you this right now: whoever I choose is going to be so bonkers, you're going to wish like hell it was Judge Judy.""

9,Martin Truex Jr. wins Kansas race marred by frightening wreck | FOX Sports,"Martin Truex Jr. won the Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway on Saturday night, but the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race ended on a somewhat somber note after a frightening, fiery crash left driver Aric Almirola in a local hospital.

It was a wild night for sure, and not only because Almirola had to be airlifted to the University of Kansas Medical Center after being cut from his No. 43 Richard Petty Motorsports Ford.

There were a series of wrecks over the final 25 laps, even after the earlier horrific one involving Almirola, Danica Patrick and Joey Logano.

Truex survived them all to win at Kansas after tough luck prevented him from doing so on two occasions recently when he had the dominant car but couldn’t park it in Victory Lane. He led 95 laps but finished ninth in the spring race in 2015, and last spring led 172 after starting from the pole — but finished 14th after a fluke pit-road mishap.

“We finally did it! You are one hell of a crew chief!” Truex shouted into his team radio as he took the checkered flag, referring to crew chief Cole Pearn.

Truex Jr. passed Blaney for the lead with 25 laps to go, but Corey LaJoie hit the wall just one lap later — sending the leaders to pit road. Blaney’s No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing Ford beat the No. 78 Furniture Row Racing Toyota of Truex off pit road by a nose, but could not hold Truex off on the subsequent restart with 19 laps remaining.

Then, after Truex pulled away and appeared to be cruising toward victory, his Furniture Row Racing teammate Erik Jones got turned by Ty Dillon, bringing out the 14th caution of the long night. That set up yet another restart with Truex, as the leader, choosing the inside line on the front row with Blaney lined up on his outside.

The 15th caution and still another restart loomed right behind, as the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota of Denny Hamlin touched the left-rear of Kurt Busch’s No. 41 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford, and Busch shot into the No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevy of Jimmie Johnson.

Blaney started the race from the pole, won Stage 2 and led a total of 83 laps.

But in the end, Blaney could not hold off Truex, who earned his second victory of the season by repeatedly getting the jump on Blaney on restarts over the final 25 laps. Truex also won earlier this season at Las Vegas.

“You just got to time it right,” Truex said of continually getting the jump on restarts. “I’ve been a victim of the same thing. That kid (Blaney) is good, man. He’s going to win a ton of races. He’s really talented and their cars are fast right now.

“You do 10 restarts, eight of them you get right, two of them you screw up. You just hope the ones you screw up aren’t for the win. Today, we were able to get those ones right when it mattered. You know, what can I say? It was just an awesome team effort.”

The night took on a somber tone on Lap 200, with 67 to go, when a part appeared to break in the right-front of Logano’s No. 22 Team Penske Ford, triggering a terrifying high-speed wreck with the No. 10 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford of Patrick and the No. 43 Ford of Almirola.

After the part appeared to break in Logano’s car, he hooked Patrick. Then Almirola, who was trying to check up behind them, plowed into both cars, hitting Logano’s almost head-on as all three cars burst into a collective ball of fire.

Almirola had to be cut from his car by safety workers and was placed in an ambulance on spine board and a stretcher, and subsequently was airlifted to the University of Kansas Medical Center. FOX Sports was told that Almirola was awake and alert, and that he was being kept there for further observation and evaluation.

Logano clearly was shaken by the incident.

“I’m okay. Just saying a lot of prayers for Aric right now,” Logano told FOX Sports after getting checked out and released from the infield care center. “A lot of us took a hard hit. Something broke on my car, I don’t know what it was. I noticed it as I was trying to go in. I tried to back it off but you’re going 215 (miles per hour) and it’s hard to check up.

“The car just took a bit step sideways into the corner and I hooked Danica (Patrick). I haven’t seen a replay yet, I don’t know what happened. You can see the right-front popped (right there) and it popped. I just hope everyone is okay. I hope Aric is all right. That’s the last thing you want to see, a big hit like that for anyone. It’s unfortunate for everyone. Let’s hope that Aric is alright.”

After a lengthy delay to remove Almirola from his car and get the track cleaned up, the race resumed with Blaney in the lead.

Truex, however, had the better car on the longer runs and was stalking him. After retaking the lead following the restart with 19 to go, Truex gradually built a lead and then survived the series of restarts down the stretch.

Blaney faded to fourth by the finish after falling back on the final restart. Brad Keselowski finished second, Kevin Harvick was third and Kyle Busch ended up fifth.

Earlier, Kyle Busch won Stage 1 and led much of Stage 2 – but faded back toward the end of the second one as Blaney surged back to the front and won it.

Chase Elliott, driver of the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet was running third in the early stages of the race when Landon Cassill lost a right-front tire around the Lap 50 mark, sending most of the rest of the field, including Elliott, down pit road for fresh rubber.

As Elliott was pulling out of his pit stall, Michael McDowell was attempting to pit in front of him. The two made contact, causing significant damage to the right-front of Elliott’s No. 24 Chevrolet.

When the race restarted on Lap 55, Elliott restarted way back in 34th following lengthy repairs on pit road. Elliott was able to continue, but his chances of winning were over.

Truex, meanwhile, was just getting started on what he finally was able to finish at what previously had been his hard-luck track.

“It’s always good to get a nice beer shower, 5-Hour Energy and whatever else they’re throwing on us here,” Truex told FOX Sports in Victory Lane. “Pretty awesome. Awesome day. Awesome weekend.

“This team rocks, man, they’re so good. We just stuck with it all night. We had an awesome race car. There’s times there we looked like we weren’t going to have a shot at it. We just kept fighting and made it happen.”

3,Emmanuel Macron to be sworn in as French president,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Emmanuel Macron will be France's youngest leader since Napoleon

Tight security is in place across Paris for the inauguration of Emmanuel Macron as France's president.

Mr Macron, an independent, won a resounding victory in last weekend's second round of voting against the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.

The former investment banker had never contested an election before and only formed his centrist political movement a year ago.

Mr Macron takes over from outgoing President Francois Hollande.

Hundreds of extra police will be on patrol across the French capital while the ceremony is conducted at the Elysee Palace, the president's official residence.

France has been under a state of emergency since terror attacks in 2015 and a large section of the city centre will be closed to traffic all morning.

Following the handover of power, an inspection of troops will be followed by a 21-gun salute.

Mr Macron will then visit the Arc de Triomphe and lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier.

Hard work ahead: Damian Grammaticas, BBC Europe correspondent

Emmanuel Macron's task is to bring about the renewal he's promised for France, to shake up its old political order, reinvigorate its anaemic economy and bring down unemployment rates, hovering at around 10%.

To achieve all that Mr Macron needs his brand new political party, La Republique En Marche, to secure a large number of seats in next month's parliamentary elections. Otherwise he will find it hard to push through his planned reforms.

If he fails, he knows he could wind up like his predecessor, the socialist Francois Hollande, who promised to bring change, but ended up being viewed as weak and indecisive, and who leaves office as France's least popular president of modern times.

At 39, Mr Macron will become France's youngest leader since Napoleon and the first to be born after 1958, when France's fifth republic was put in place by President Charles de Gaulle.

His En Marche political movement was formed just last year and as a new party - La Republique En Marche - will be fielding candidates for almost all of France's 577 seats in June's parliamentary elections.

Mr Macron will need a strong presence in parliament to put in place the economic and social reforms he promised voters during his campaign.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Flags lined the Champs-Elysees on Saturday ready for the inauguration

He has promised to ""work for everyone"" and sees his programme as straddling both left and right.

Mr Macron's first week in office will be busy. He heads for Berlin on Monday to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel and to demonstrate his commitment to the European Union.

He is also expected to name a prime minister.

Mr Macron faces major challenges including high unemployment, especially among France's young, and low economic growth.

He says his main aims are to boost investment and to set up a ""new growth model"" that increases social mobility and helps the environment.",bbc-news
9,Joanna Jedrzejczyk picks apart Jessica Andrade to earn fifth straight title defense | FOX Sports,"DALLAS — Joanna Jedrzejczyk undoubtedly heard how Jessica Andrade was supposed to be the toughest test of her championship reign.

Five rounds and 25 minutes later, Jedrzejczyk celebrated yet another victory in one of her most masterful performances to date.

Jedrzejczyk showcased speed, movement and arguably the most impressive striking arsenal of any fighter currently competing in the UFC.

It appeared Andrade’s best opportunity came in the opening round where she’s been a remarkably fast starter and the title fight on Saturday night was no different.

Andrade was quick firing out of the gate, tagging Jedrzejczyk with a big hook that whipped her head around for a moment. The shot landed flush but Jedrzejczyk was quick to recover before re-establishing her base with a series of thudding leg kicks and straight punches.

Jedrzejczyk fired back with a quick head kick that slapped Andrade in the face, but the Brazilian smiled back at her as they continued to exchange strikes throughout the opening round.

As the second round started, Jedrzejczyk’s confidence began to grow as she started to find a home for her straight jab that began snapping Andrade’s head back at will. The Brazilian tried to come back with big lefts and rights to return fire, but she came up short almost every time as the reach from the champion started to become a big problem.

As Jedrzejczyk started settling into a rhythm, she was firing off leg kicks at will and then firing off another head kick that stung Andrade as well.

Jedrzejczyk is known for her volume striking and she certainly started pouring on the offense with each passing minute while walking Andrade across the cage.

As the fight wore on, Jedrzejczyk looked like she was in a sparring session with the amount of damage she was inflicting on Andrade while the challenger could offer up little in the way of resistance outside of a random flurry with most of her punches finding no home.

In addition to her jabs and leg kicks landing at will, Jedrzejczyk continued to launch head kicks that kept catching Andrade over and over again throughout the fight. It was an amazing feat that Andrade’s chin held up from the shots she was taking, but Jedrzejczyk never waivered in her patience to keep pouring on the punishment.

It was a remarkable dismantling of a very tough strawweight contender as Jedrzejczyk was like a surgeon with her precision as she picked her shots in virtually every round.

Andrade showed incredible toughness, but she just couldn’t catch up to Jedrzejczyk’s speed, reach or volume over five rounds.

Throughout her UFC career, Jedrzejczyk has always been regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, but the way she was able to pick apart a notable power puncher like Andrade was one of her most impressive outings to date.

When the fight was over, Jedrzejczyk retained her championship for the fifth consecutive time, pitching a shutout with 50-45, 50-44, 50-45 scorecards from the judges. In total, Jedrzejczyk out landed Andrade by 225 to 83 in significant strikes over five rounds.

“No one is taking this belt from me,” Jedrzejczyk said after her hand was raised yet again. “Nobody.”

It’s tough to argue with Jedrzejcyk considering the way she seems to get better and better while clearing out every contender that’s been thrown in her path. With the win, Jedrzejczyk is expected to face Rose Namajunas in her next fight when she’s ready to go again later this year.",fox-sports
9,Martin Truex Jr. wins at Kansas; Almirola involved in scary crash,"Martin Truex Jr. celebrates after winning the Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway. (Photo: Jeffrey Becker, USA TODAY Sports)

KANSAS CITY, Kan. — Highlights from Saturday night's Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway, the 11th Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race:

WINNER: Martin Truex led a race-high 104 laps to earn his second victory of the season on a night when Aric Almirola was taken to a local hospital after a fiery crash.

Truex took the lead on a restart with 19 laps remaining, then held on after two subsequent restarts to bring his No. 78 Furniture Row Racing Toyota to victory lane at another 1½-mile track. Truex won at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in March.

""These races are so hard to win,"" Truex said in victory lane. ""Any of these restarts you never know what can happen. We won the Southern 500 with this car and now here. It's just amazing ... Awesome day, awesome weekend. We just stuck with it all night. There were times there it looked like we weren’t going to have a shot at it.""

MORE COVERAGE:

Brad Keselowski stormed back from a pit-road penalty that set him a lap down early in the race to take second. Kevin Harvick, who was also a lap down earlier in the race, finished third, pole-sitter Ryan Blaney fourth and Kyle Busch fifth.

Blaney, who led 83 laps, appeared to have the fastest car for good portions of the night, but Truex came on strong at the end, passing the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford with less than 30 laps remaining then holding off Blaney on the late restarts.

“That kid’s good,"" Truex said. ""He’s going to win a ton of races. Today, we were able to get those right when it mattered. It was an awesome team effort.”

SCARY CRASH: Almirola was airlifted to the University of Kansas Medical Center after a collision with Joey Logano and Danica Patrick. The crash was caused when something on Logano's No. 22 Ford broke, sending him hard into Patrick's No. 10 Ford in Turn 1 shortly after a restart on Lap 69. Almirola, who was trailing, came up on the wreck and hit both cars hard, lifting the No. 43 Ford's back wheels off the racing surface. Almirola's window net was lowered but safety crews continued to work to release him from the car, removing the windscreen and cutting off the top of the car. He was alert when he was pulled from the car and was placed on a board. Logano and Patrick were released from the infield care center. Patrick suffered minor burns on her fingers.

STAGE 2: Blaney captured his third stage win of the season, tying Harvick for the second-most of the season behind Truex's five. Points leader Kyle Larson was on Blaney's tail, followed by Truex, Jamie McMurray and Stage 1 winner Kyle Busch.

NEWMAN CONKS OUT: Ryan Newman, a former winner at Kansas, experienced a broken engine on lap 158 and finished last. ""The bottom end of the motor just broke,"" Newman said. ""We finally got the Chevrolet running well, not to where we needed to be, but better from how we started the race. We knocked a hole in the grill from a spring rubber or something. I watched what I hit, but I couldn’t tell what it was. Finally got enough tape on it so it would run warm and stick a little bit better and made a whole bunch of changes to the car, but just something in the motor broke, bottom end for sure, but I’m not really sure what happened first.”

STAGE 1: Kyle Busch, winner of last year’s Go Bowling 400, won Stage 1, taking the lead from Truex on the 63rd of 80 laps. It was the second stage win of the season for Busch and first since the Daytona 500. Busch also won Friday night’s Camping World Truck Series race and has a track-most seven wins at Kansas — one in Cup, four in the Xfinity Series and two in the trucks. Truex was second in Stage 1, followed by Blaney, Larson, and two-time race winners Keselowski and Jimmie Johnson, who was promptly sent to the rear of the field after going through too many pit boxes.

ELLIOTT DAMAGED: Chase Elliott’s Chevrolet suffered damage to the right front fender while exiting his pit stall when he collided with Michael McDowell, who was entering the stall during a Stage 1 caution. Elliott’s car was repaired within the five-minute window before he would have had to go to the garage. McDowell was sent to the rear of the pack because a crew member jumped over the wall too soon. Adding insult to the damage, Elliott was sent to the rear of the pack for having too many crew members over the wall when he came in for more repairs.

PASSING GRADES: After a season-high 11 race cars — including those driven by Johnson, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Clint Bowyer — failed inspection Friday and were unable to get on the track in time to qualify for Saturday’s race, all hands were on deck for the green flag. Logano, whose team was penalized and crew chief Todd Gordon suspended for two weeks (including this race), after failing post-race inspection following a win at Richmond, could empathize with the drivers who had to start from the rear of the field.

“I think every team pushes the limits and finds them every weekend when you roll through tech like that,” said Logano, who started on the outside of the front row alongside Blaney. “We are right on that edge. Any little discrepancy is what makes you go over the line. You have to be close to the edge. If you aren’t close to the edge you won’t be competitive. That is not just the car, that is the drivers too.

“The drivers have to be right on the edge of out of control, with the rules, we have to handle that every week. It is the same for everyone but you have to push it to the edge if you want to win. That is just part of it.”

TO THE REAR: Two cars were sent to the back of the field — McDowell because of an engine change and Matt DiBenedetto, for an unapproved tire change.
